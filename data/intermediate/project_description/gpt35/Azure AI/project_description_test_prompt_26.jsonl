{"input":"Question: What is the project summary, province, country, latitude, and longitude of this project?\n\nContext: \n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nPROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nThe primary objective of Z\u00e9 Tunin Small Hydropower Plant Project Activity is to help meet Brazil\u2019s\nrising demand for energy due to economic growth and to improve the supply of electricity, while\ncontributing to environmental, social and economic sustainability by increasing the share of\nrenewable energy in total electricity consumption for Brazil (and for the region of Latin America\nand the Caribbean).\nCountries in the Latin America and the Caribbean region have expressed their commitment\ntowards achieving a target of 10% renewable energy of total energy use in the region. Through\nan initiative from the Ministers of the Environment in 2002, a preliminary meeting of the World\nSummit for Sustainable Development (WSSD) was held in Johannesburg in 2002. In the WSSD\nfinal Plan of Implementation no specific targets or timeframes were stated, however, their\nimportance was recognized for achieving sustainability in accordance with the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals.\nThe privatization process of the Brazilian electric sector, initiated in 1995 commenced with the\nexpectation of adequate tariffs (fewer subsidies) and better prices for generators. It drew the\nattention of investors to possible alternatives not available in the centrally planned electricity\nmarket. Unfortunately, the Brazilian energy market lacked a consistent expansion plan; the\ncurrent expansion plan contains major problems such as political and regulatory uncertainties. In\nthe late 1990\u2019s a strong increase in demand contrasted with a less-than-average increase in\ninstalled capacity caused the outbreak of the supply crisis\/rationing in 2001\/2002. One of the\nsolutions the government provided was flexible legislation, which favoured smaller independent\nenergy producers. Furthermore, the possible eligibility under the Clean Development Mechanism\nof the Kyoto Protocol drew the attention of investors to small hydropower projects.\nThe project consists of the construction of a small hydroelectric power plant (\u201cPCH\u201d, from the\nPortuguese Pequena Central Hidrel\u00e9trica): Z\u00e9 Tunin with 8 MW of installed capacity and 0.367\nkm2 reservoir area. The plant is located in the Pomba River, state of Minas Gerais, Southeastern\nregion of Brazil. The project is fully operational since January 2013. In addition, Z\u00e9 Tunin Small\nHydropower Plant Project Activity has a diesel generator to ensure operations in case of\nemergency.\nZ\u00e9 Tunin is owned by Pequena Central Hidrel\u00e9trica Z\u00e9 Tunin S.A., which is a company controlled\nby Energisa S.A.\nPrior to the implementation of the project activity no small hydropower plant was operational in\nthe location where Z\u00e9 Tunin project was built. The project activity reduces GHG emissions by\navoiding electricity generation from fossil fuel sources, which would be generated (and emitted) in\nthe absence of the project. In conclusion, the baseline scenario and the scenario without the\nproject activity are the same.\nAccording to the applicable methodology, in the project activity scenario, there are emissions of\nmethane (CH4) from the water reservoir of hydropower plants. However, since the power density\nof Ze Tunin is greater than 10 W\/m2, there are no GHG emissions involved in the project activity.\nv3.2 3\n\n[['', 'Organization name', '', 'Pequena Central Hidrel\u00e9trica Z\u00e9 Tunin S.A.'], ['', 'Contact person', '', 'Gustavo Nasser Moreira'], ['', 'Title', '', '-'], ['', 'Address', '', 'Pra\u00e7a Rui Barbosa, 80 \u2013 Centro \u2013 Cataguazes \u2013 Minas Gerais - Brazil'], ['', 'Telephone', '', '+55 (21) 2122-6924'], ['', 'Email', '', 'gustavo@energisa.com.br']]\n[['', 'Organization name', '', 'Ecopart Assessoria em Neg\u00f3cios Empresariais Ltda.'], ['', 'Role in the project', '', 'Carbon Credits consultancy'], ['', 'Contact person', '', 'Melissa Sawaya Hirschheimer'], ['', 'Title', '', '-'], ['', 'Address', '', 'Rua Padre Jo\u00e3o Manoel, 222 \u2013 S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 SP \u2013 Brazil'], ['', 'Telephone', '', '+55 (11) 3063-9068']]\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nZ\u00e9 Tunin project can be seen as a solution by the private sector to the Brazilian electricity sector\nsince it may help to avoid another electricity supply crisis, contributing to sustainable\ndevelopment and having a positive effect for the country beyond the evident reductions in GHG.\nAlthough Z\u00e9 Tunin does not have a relevant positive impact in the host country given its electric\nsystem size, it is without reasonable doubt part of a greater idea. The project contributes to\nsustainable development since it meets the present needs without compromising the ability of\nfuture generations to meet their own needs, as defined by the Brundtland Commission (1987). In\nother words, the implementation of small hydroelectric power plants ensures renewable energy\ngeneration, reduces the national electric system demand, avoids negative social and\nenvironmental impact caused by the construction of large hydropower plants with large reservoirs\nand fossil fuel thermo power plants, and drives regional economies, increasing quality of life in\nlocal communities.\nTherefore, indisputably the project has reduced negative environmental impacts and has\ndeveloped the regional economies, resulting, consequently, in better quality of life.

The\nintermittent irrigation method requires that in the process of rice cultivation, irrigation and\ndrainage can be controlled by ditches and valves according to the growing needs of rice. The low\neconomic level leads to the low income of farmers, which means that farmers do not have the\nadditional financial capacity to afford the construction of cement ditches that can implement\ncontrolled irrigation and drainage. Therefore, the project has not yet been implemented to\ngenerate greenhouse gas emissions for subsequent reduction, removal, or destruction.\n11","output":"{'project_name': 'Zhuangmiao-3 Water Management with Rice Cultivation', 'project_summary': 'The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittently flooded conditions during rice cultivation is conducted in the north of Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture (hereinafter \u201cWenshan Prefecture\u201d), Yunnan Province, China, with a total acreage of 12,103 ha of double-cropping rice. Without the project, there would be no ditches, pumps, valves, and reservoirs to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously flooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario.

{"input":"Question: What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?\n\nContext: \n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\n1 PROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nCore CarbonX Solutions Private Limited (CCX) is a carbon management consultancy company with\nregistered office in the state of Telangana. CCX is the Project Proponent (PP) of the carbon offset project\ncalled \u201cBan Odisha01\u201d in all districts of Odisha. The carbon credit rights is transferred to CCX which in\nturn will share the carbon revenue to farmers on realisation of carbon credits. The individual farmers are\nthe owners of the lands on which trees are being grown to sequester carbon and reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions from the atmosphere. CCX has mobilized the farmers in the selected states of India to plant\nvarious tree species on their lands. These tree species range from fruit bearing trees like Indian\nblackberry, Guava, Mango, lemon to commercial species like cashew, arjuna, asana, teak, mahogany,\netc. Simple tree cultivation techniques involving planting saplings in the pits with minimum disturbance\nto the lands have been employed by the selected farmers.\nThe villages under the project area predominantly have an agrarian economy where most of its population\ndepends on agriculture. The condition prior to the project initiation was barren land or agriculture as\nmaize, chili, pulses and paddy or other commercial crops were grown by the farmers on their farmlands\nwith limited agroforestry species. The planation was done by the farmers and utilized the subsidies to\navail the saplings. The saplings do the sequestration of carbon dioxide at faster pace and ultimately\nreduces GHG emissions.\nThe Project Activity will lead to considerable carbon sequestration in the project areas and will contribute\nstrongly to the sustainable development of rural villages involved in the project.\nThe project quantifies the GHG removals occurring from agroforestry plantations through the use of AR-\nACM0003: \u201cAfforestation and reforestation project activities implemented on lands other than wetlands\u201d,\nVersion 02.0 developed under the Clean Development Mechanism for large-scale plantations. The project\nplans to generate carbon credits for the voluntary market under the VCS standard. Such planting activity\nwould result in carbon credits that would be sold in the carbon market to generate revenue. As per the\nCarbon-offset agreement entered into between the farmers and CCX, 60%-80 of the carbon income\ngenerated from the sale of carbon credits would be distributed among the farmers. The project activity\nwas implemented in 1900 hectares. Through carbon sequestration by the planted trees, the project is\nexpected to generate annual average GHG emission reductions or removals of 15671 tCO2e.\nThe selected farmers are those farmers who did not plant anything on their lands as they were fallow\nlands. CCX company held workshops in the villages and advised the villagers to grow certain types of fruit\nand commercial trees in a sustainable manner to earn carbon revenue. The idea of earning additional\nrevenue caught the farmers attention and they decided to enter into carbon-offset agreements with the\nCCX company.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nSectoral Scope: 14: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)\nType of activity: Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR).\n4\n\n[['Organization name', None, None, '', 'Core CarbonX Solutions Private Limited', ''], ['Contact person', None, None, '', 'Mr. Niroj Kumar Mohanty', ''], ['Title', None, None, '', 'Managing Director', ''], ['Address', None, None, '', '5R, Block \u2018A\u2019, Kanthi Shikara Complex, 6-3-668\/9, Punjagutta,', ''], [None, None, None, None, 'Hyderabad \u2013 500082, Telangana, India', None], ['', 'Telephone', '', '', '+919908387772', ''], ['', 'Email', '', '', 'nmohanty@corecarbonx.com; info@corecarbonx.com', '']]\n[['', 'Organization name', '', '', 'NA', ''], ['', 'Role in the project', '', '', 'NA', ''], ['', 'Contact person', '', '', 'NA', ''], ['', 'Title', '', '', 'NA', ''], ['', 'Address', '', '', 'NA', ''], ['', 'Telephone', '', '', 'NA', '']]\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nThe project is a not a grouped project\n1.3 Project Eligibility\nThe project is eligible under the scope of the VCS Program as the project includes AFOLU activities (project\ncategory ARR), which are supported by a methodology approved under the VCS Program.

The\ntrees will sequester carbon dioxide from atmosphere for many decades.\nSince these trees are planted for non-timber use, these trees will stand\nfor ages sequestering carbon from city. This will help the city in reducing\ncarbon emissions.\nSDG 15 \u2013 Life on Land - Variety of birds, insects, animals and reptiles\nlive and thrive on the trees for food and shelter. Trees can hold the top\nlayer soil intact protecting it from any erosion. A protected soil can hold\nthe nutrients for a longer period and therefore can support further\ngrowth and survival of vegetation.\nSDG 3 \u2013 Good health and well-being: Trees will release oxygen as part\nof their photosynthesis process as well as protect the people from noise\npollution by acting as a sound barrier.

NEWS has been\nimplementing the project on behalf of the French food and beverage company Danone, who is\nthe developer of the project. In July 2011, Danone, together with Credit Agricole, Schneider\nElectric and CDC Climat, has decided to launch an innovative carbon investment fund, the\nLivelihoods Fund, which fundamental goal is to create social value for rural communities and\ncontribute to their food security through the restoration of their ecosystems. The Livelihoods Fund\nprovides investors access to biodiversity friendly carbon credits that aid the rural poor through\nlarge scale and social impact projects.\nDanone agreed to transfer all its rights and obligations under the contract signed with NEWS to\nthe Livelihoods Fund, under the terms and conditions in respect of these contracts which shall\nremain unchanged. As a result, the Livelihoods Fund replaces Danone as the project developer\nof \u201cMangrove restoration project\u201d. The Livelihoods Fund replaces Danone as project participant in\nany relevant project documentation and is fully committed to support the further development and\nimplementation of the \u201cMangrove restoration project\u201d as initially agreed and planned. NEWS\nagrees that it remains fully bound by the terms of the contract it has originally signed with\nDanone.\nEx-ante estimations were done based on the already implemented first project instances as well\nas the identified second instances comprising a total area of 4,623.98 ha (4,403.93 in the first and\n220.05 ha second instances respectively). Assuming a conservative annual carbon sequestration\nrate of 11.1 tCO e\/ ha which considers above and below ground biomass, dead wood and soil 2\norganic carbon (SOC) the project will sequester 51,249 tCO eper year. Based on this ex-ante 2\nestimation, the project will sequester around 1,024,976 tonnes of tCO e over 20 years. 2\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThe activity implemented corresponds to the VCS sectoral scope 14: \u201cAgriculture, Forestry and\nOther Land Use\u201d as Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR) AFOLU project\ncategory.

However, intermittently flooded\nwater regime requires that irrigation and drainage can be controlled according to the growth\nneeds of rice during its cultivation. Whereas in fact, the low economic level leads to the low\nincome of farmers, which means that farmers have no additional economic capacity to afford\nthe construction of cement ditches which can practice controllable irrigation and drainage. So,\nthe project has not been implemented to generate GHG emissions for the purpose of their\nsubsequent reduction, removal, or destruction.\n12","output":"{'project_name': 'Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation in Eastern Hechuan District', 'project_summary': 'The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Hechuan District, Chongqing City, with a total acreage of 18,908 ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the backward continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and less methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\\r\\nThe implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir construction and necessary training for the farmers to help them conduct the intermittent flooded water regime during rice cultivation, which replaces the traditional continuously flooded method. During rice cultivation, controllable irrigation and drainage according to the needs of rice growth can not only save water resources, but also reduce methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions (flooded state) In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%. Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 2.79 tCO2e\/ha for rice is expected.\\r\\nThe implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 368,711 tCO2e in the first seven-year period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 52,673 tCO2e.\\r\\nThis project aims to:\\r\\n- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes.\\r\\n- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers.\\r\\n- Provide more job opportunities, especially female workers.\\r\\n- Use a proportion of benefits to improve the local children\u2019s education.', 'project_state_province': 'Chongqing', 'project_country': 'China', 'project_latitude': 29.89, 'project_longitude': 105.99}"}

The project is developed by KR One Co., Ltd,\nThailand. KR One Co., Ltd is a subsidiary of Wind Energy Holding Co., Ltd.\nThe purpose of the project activity is to generate clean electricity with utilization of wind energy.\nThe project consists of 30 numbers of GE Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) of 3.0 MW\ncapacities each. The project WTGs are installed in the Nongwang sub district of Thepharak\ndistrict Nakhonratchasima Province in Thailand.\nAll the WTGs of the project activity were commissioned on 16\/03\/2019.\nThe electricity generated by the project is exported to the Thailand National grid. The project\nactivity will therefore displace an equivalent amount of electricity which would have otherwise\nbeen generated by fossil fuel dominant electricity grid. Since wind power is Greenhouse Gas\n(GHG) emissions free, the power generated will prevent the anthropogenic gas emissions\ngenerated by fossil fuel based thermal power stations comprising coal, natural gas, diesel, and\nbunker oil.\nThere was no activity at the site prior to implementation of the project activity. Hence the scenario\nexisting prior to the project activity is same as baseline scenario which is continual use of highly\ncarbon intensive electricity in the regional grid.\nThe estimation of GHG reductions by this project is limited to carbon dioxide (CO2) only. Thus the\nproject activity leads to an emission reduction of 148,089 tCO per year or 1,480,890 tCO2 for the 2\nchosen crediting period of 10 years.\nThe current monitoring period chosen is from 16-March-2019 to 31-October-2019 (inclusive of\nfirst & last date) and the GHG emission reductions calculated are 89,603 tCO 2\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nSectoral Scope: 01- Energy Industries (Renewable\/Non-Renewable Sources)\nProject Type: Type I\nMethodology:\nACM0002: Grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources, version 19.0\nv3.1 3","output":"{'project_name': 'K.R.

It\ndoes not involve addition of renewable energy based\nelectricity generation units at an existing renewable\npower generation facility.\n1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG\nemission reductions and\/or removal enhancements:\nThe project activity displaces electricity generated by\nfossil fuel intensive power plants in the grid. Since the\nbiomass is formed by fixing the atmospheric CO by the 2\naction of photosynthesis in the presence of sunlight, the\nCO released due to combustion of biomass is assumed to be 2\nequal to the CO fixed by the photosynthesis. Again the 2\nCO released during the combustion will be consumed by the 2\nplant species for their growth. In view of the above,\nbiomass combustion and growth of biomass and associated\nCO consumption and release can be treated as a cyclic 2\nprocess resulting in no net increase of CO in the 2\natmosphere. Hence, the burning of biomass in the plant\nwill not lead to GHG emissions. Rather it will result in\nreduction of GHG emissions by replacing fossil fuel which\nwould have been burnt to produce 7.5 MW power in the grid\nin the absence of the project activity.\n1.9 Project technologies, products, services and the\nexpected level of activity:\nThe project activity involves installation of a 7.5MW\nturbo generator with steam inlet conditions of 64 kg\/cm2\nat 480oC.

However, the Project Crediting Period\nStart Date under the VCS 2007.1 is defined as should not be earlier than 28 March\n2006. Hence, we determined the Project Crediting Period Start Date of the proposed\nproject as 1 April 2006 according to the conservative principle.\nThe crediting period for VCS project is a maximum of ten years which may be\nrenewed at most two times. The life time of the project is generally considered longer\nthan 30 years; therefore, the first crediting period of ten years is applied to the\nemission reduction estimation in this PD.\n1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:\n\uff081\uff09 The local social and economic condition before the project3\nYunnan is one of China's relatively undeveloped provinces with more poverty-\nstricken counties than the other provinces. In 2004, Yunnan's nominal GDP was 295.9\nbillion Yuan, and the GDP per capita was 6,733 Yuan, which was only higher than\nthat of Gansu and Guizhou in China. The share of primary, secondary, and tertiary\nindustries in GDP were 20.4%, 44.4% and 35.2% respectively. Yunnan's four pillar\nindustries are tobacco, agriculture, mining, and tourism. The electricity industry is\nanother important economic pillar which plays an important role in the \"West-East\nElectricity Transmission Project\". The electricity produced in Yunnan is mainly\ntransported to Guangdong Province.\nTengchong County is a major city with well-developed commerce and culture in the\nsouthwest border of Baoshan city, Yunnan province. In 2002, the county\u201fs GNP\nconsisted 24.5% of Baoshan city. Its total industrial and agricultural output value was\n1669.95 million Yuan, thereinto industrial output value was 608.99 million Yuan\naccounted for 36.47%, and that of agriculture was 1060.96 million Yuan accounted\nfor 63.53%.
