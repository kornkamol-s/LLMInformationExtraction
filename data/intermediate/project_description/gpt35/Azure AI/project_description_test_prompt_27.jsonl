The total installed\ncapacity of the project is 60 MW; which involves operation of 30 Wind Turbine Generators\n(WTGs) with capacity of 2 MW each located at Maharashtra state in India. The project is\npromoted by CLP Wind Farms (India) Private Limited.\nThe Project activity is a new facility (Greenfield) and the purpose of the project activity is to\ngenerate energy electricity by the utilization of wind velocity power and further selling the\ngenerated energy to the NEWNE Grid. In this process there is no consumption of any fossil fuel\nand hence the project does not lead to any greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, electricity would be\ngenerated through sustainable means without causing any negative impact on the environment.\nThe estimated annual average GHG emission reductions from the project activity will be 118,364\ntonnes of CO2 and total GHG emission reductions for the chosen 10 year crediting period will be\n1,183,640 tonnes of CO2.\nIn the Pre- project scenario the entire electricity, delivered to the grid by the project activity, would\nhave otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the\naddition of new generation sources.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThe project activity falls under the following Sectoral scope and Project Type:\nSectoral Scope : 01 - Energy industries (renewable \/ non renewable sources)\nProject Type : I - Renewable Energy Projects\nMethodology:\nACM0002: Grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources --- Version 16.0\nhttp:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/methodologies\/DB\/EY2CL7RTEHRC9V6YQHLAR6MJ6VEU83\nThe project is not a grouped project activity.\n1.3 Project Proponent\nv3.2 3\n\n[['', 'Organization name', '', 'NA'], ['', 'Role in the project', '', 'NA'], ['', 'Contact person', '', 'NA'], ['', 'Title', '', 'NA'], ['', 'Address', '', 'NA'], ['', 'Telephone', '', 'NA'], ['', 'Email', '', 'NA']]\n[['', 'S.

The\nintermittent irrigation method requires that in the process of rice cultivation, irrigation and\ndrainage can be controlled by ditches and valves according to the growing needs of rice.

Without the project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario.

Kamuthi Solar Power Limited (KSPL) is the promoter of\nthe proposed project activity and is the holding company of both the project investors in this project\nactivity.\nThe project activity involves installation of 216 MW (corresponding 261 MWp) solar power project in ac\nTamil Nadu. The project will replace anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG\u2019s) estimated to\nbe approximately 346,116 tCO e per year, thereon displacing 358,559 MWh\/year amount of electricity 2\nfrom the generation-mix of power plants connected to the Indian electricity grid, which is mainly\ndominated by thermal\/fossil fuel based power plant. Total estimated GHG emission reductions for the\nchosen 10 year renewable crediting period will be 3,461,169 tonnes of CO2.\nThe monitoring period is from 18-Sept-2016 to 27-March-2018. The total GHG emission reductions or\nremovals generated in this monitoring period are 563,810 tCO2.\nIn this process there is no consumption of any fossil fuel and hence the project does not lead to any\ngreenhouse gas emissions. Thus, electricity would be generated through sustainable means without\ncausing any negative impact on the environment.\nThe details of the project are mentioned in the table:\nScenario existing prior to the implementation of project activity:\nThe scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project activity, is electricity delivered to the grid\nby the project activity that would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected\npower plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as reflected in the combined margin (CM)\ncalculations described in the \u201cTool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system\u201d.\nBaseline Scenario:\nAs per the applicable methodology, a Greenfield power plant is defined as \u201ca new renewable energy\npower plant that is constructed and operated at a site where no renewable energy power plant was\noperated prior to the implementation of the project activity\u201d.\nAs the project activity falls under the definition of a Greenfield power plant, the baseline scenario as per\nparagraph 24 of Section 5.2.1 of applied methodology is the following:\nIf the project activity is the installation of a Greenfield power plant, the baseline scenario is electricity\ndelivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-\nconnected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as reflected in the combined\nmargin (CM) calculations described in the \u201cTool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system\u201d.\nHence, pre-project scenario and baseline scenario are the same.\nv3.1 3\n\n[['', 'Organization name', '', 'Kamuthi Solar Power Limited'], ['', 'Contact person', '', 'Mr. D Trivedi'], ['', 'Title', '', 'Sr. Manager - Business Development'], ['Address', 'Address', None, '5B, Sambhav Press Building, Judges Bunglow Road, Bodakdev,\\nAhmedabad, Gujarat, India.'], ['', 'Telephone', '', '+91 79 2555 7429'], ['', 'Email', '', 'cs@adani.com']]\n[['', 'Organization name', '', 'Infinite Solutions'], ['', 'Role in the project', '', 'Project Consultant'], ['', 'Contact person', '', 'Mr. Jimmy Sah'], ['', 'Title', '', 'Head - Sustainability'], ['', 'Address', '', '611, Chetak Centre Main, 12\/2 RNT Marg, Indore- 452001'], ['', 'Telephone', '', '+91-9644130430'], ['', 'Email', '', 'jimmy@infisolutions.org']]\n[['', 'Project Scale', None, ''], ['Project', None, '', None], ['Large project', None, '(cid:214)', None]]\nJOINT PROJECT DESCRIPTION & MONITORING REPORT: VCS Version 3\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThe project activity falls under the following Sectoral scope and Project Type:\nSectoral Scope : 01 - Energy industries (renewable \/ non-renewable sources)\nProject Type : I - Renewable Energy Projects\nMethodology : ACM0002: Grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources -\nVersion 18.11\nThe project is not a grouped project activity.\n1.3 Project Proponent\n1.4 Other Entities Involved in the Project\n1.5 Project Start Date\nProject Start Date: 18-September-2016\nThe project start date is the date on which Solar Panels were commissioned under the Project activity.\n1.6 Project Crediting Period\nCrediting Period Start date: 18-September-2016\nCrediting Period End date: 17-September-2026\nThe project activity adopts renewable crediting period of 10 years period which can be renewed for 2\ntimes.\n1.7 Project Scale and Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals\n1 https:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/methodologies\/DB\/5725LCHYPYM4I1V8OD9SFYVAMFFWNP\nv3.1 4","output":"{'project_name': '216 MWac Kamuthi Solar Power Project', 'project_summary': 'The project activity involves installation of 216 MWac (corresponding 261 MWp) solar power project in Tamil Nadu.

The\nintermittent irrigation method requires that in the process of rice cultivation, irrigation and\ndrainage can be controlled by ditches and valves according to the growing needs of rice. The low\neconomic level leads to the low income of farmers, which means that farmers do not have the\nadditional financial capacity to afford the construction of cement ditches that can implement\ncontrolled irrigation and drainage. Therefore, the project has not yet been implemented to\ngenerate greenhouse gas emissions for subsequent reduction, removal, or destruction.\nSince the conditions existing before the project initiation are the same as the baseline scenario,\nplease refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario) to see the detailed information.\n\u2022 Ecosystem type: The major ecosystem type of Liupanshui City is forest.

The design lifetime of the ditches in this project is 30 years, so\nthe project lifetime is 30 years. The project's lifetime starts from the date the ditches are completed, so the start date of the\nproject lifetime is earlier than the project's start date.\n4 Section 3.8 of the VCS Standard, v4.2 states that \u201cThe project crediting period is the time for which GHG emission reductions\nor removals generated by the project are eligible for issuance as VCUs.\u201d According to the Methodology of Methane emission\nreduction by adjusted water management practice in rice cultivation, the time when the project produces emission\nreductions is the start time of land preparation. And the land preparation means the start of a rice season. The main activity\nof this project is emission reduction due to adjusted water regime during rice cultivation, which means emission reduction for\neach year only occurred thought the rice-growing season. Therefore, although the crediting period in 2020 does not start\nfrom 1st January, it has already included the whole rice-growing season in a year.\n7","output":"{'crediting_period_start': '2020-04-08', 'crediting_period_end': '2027-04-07'}"}

General description of small-scale project activity\nA.1 Title of the small-scale project activity:\nTaohua 9MW Hydro Power Project in Guizhou Province, China\nThe version 4.0 PDD was completed on 18\/09\/2007\nA.2. Description of the small-scale project activity:\nTaohua Hydro Power Project in Guizhou Province of China is a run-of-river hydro power plant sited in\nWangsi Town, Duyun City in Guizhou Province with the installed capacity 9MW.The proposed project\nwas developed by the Water Resource Bureau of Qiannan district and started to construct in 1996, but the\nproposed project was shut down in 1998 because of short fund. In 2004 the project owner purchased this\nproject and continued to develop this project according to the stipulation of CDM.\nThe hinge of the power project includes the arch dam with the height of 40.2m, the hydropower tunnels\nwith the length of 206m and the power plant. There are 2 generators with the type of SF3000-22\/3250 and\n1 generator with the type of SF3000-20\/3250, and 2 turbines with the type of HLD74-LJ-150 and 1\nturbine with type of HLF13-LJ-140.The electricity generated by the proposed project will be connected to\nGuizhou Province Power Grid, finally to China Southern Power Grid. The annual electricity generation is\n37,800MWh, and the annual feed-in electricity to the grid is 36,670MWh[1]. Electricity generated by the\nproposed project will displace part of the electricity generated by China Southern Power Grid which is\ndominated by fossil fuel-fired power plants, and thus greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions could be\nachieved. The estimated annual GHG emission reductions of Taohua project are 29,516 tCO e[2]. 2\nAs a renewable hydro power project, the proposed project will produce positive environmental and\neconomic benefits and contribute to the local sustainable development through following aspects:\n(cid:122) To be consistent with China\u2019s national energy policy and the Western Development Strategy,\nwill alleviate power shortage in the local areas, will improve the local poor condition and\nadvance the standard of living of local people.\n(cid:122) To displace part of the electricity from coal-fired power plants, and thus will avoid\nenvironmental pollution caused by coal burning.\n(cid:122) To create new job opportunities for the local people. In the construction period, the rural\nlabour force can be arranged.11 long-term job opportunities will be provided in the operation\nperiod[3].\n(cid:122) After the operation of the proposed project, the local people can make good use of electricity\ninstead of biomass, especially firewood, which can reduce the destroying to local vegetation and\nprotect the environment.\nA.3. Project participants:\n1 Refer to The mainly technical-economic indices clarification document of Taohua Hydro Power Project.\n2 The results were calculated by the emission reduction factor, which is announced by national Development and\nReformer Commission(NDRC) and revised by DOE.\n3 Refer to the actual personnel arrangement of Taohua Hydro Power Project.\n\n[['Name of Party involved (*)\\n((host) indicates a host\\nParty)', 'Private and\/or public entity(ies)\\nproject participants (*) (as\\napplicable)', 'Kindly indicate if the Party\\ninvolved wishes to be\\nconsidered as project\\nparticipant (Yes\/No)'], ['P.R.China (host)', 'Guizhou Qiannan Zhongshui Hydro\\nPower Development Co.Ltd.(Project\\nowner)', 'No'], ['England', 'ICECAP Carbon Portfolio\\nLimited(buyer)', 'No']]\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM PDD) - Version 03\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board\npage 4\nTable 1 The information of the project participants\nThe detailed information of participants is included in Annex 1.\nA.4.

However, in the event that any such future REC mechanisms are implemented for\navailing GHG abatement benefits and issuance of RECs imply that carbon credits cannot be\nissued under global mechanisms or vice-versa, the project proponents shall apply for issuance\nof only one of the two benefits, i.e., RECs or carbon credits.\n1.14 Project rejected under other GHG programs (if applicable):\nIt is to be noted that for each of the wind-mills under consideration that the GHG abatement\nbenefits (CERs\/VCUs) for any particular duration of time can be claimed only under one GHG\nabatement scheme (CDM\/VCS). Hence, the VCUs accumulated for the project activity from the\ndate of crediting period would be claimed under the VCS mechanism. Furthermore, the VCS\ncrediting period of the individual wind-mill would extend till the date of CDM Registration, after\nwhich CERs would be claimed under CDM for the same. In case of failure in registration in the\nCDM cycle, the carbon credits related benefits will be continued to be claimed under VCS\nscheme.\nThe wind-mills installed under the project activity are eligible to apply under other GHG\nprograms like CDM and VCS.
