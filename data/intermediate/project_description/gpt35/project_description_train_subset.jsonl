It can be assumed that the availability of\ntropical timber has diminished, but demand has not. Availability on the international\nmarket has decreased because of rapid degradation of natural forests due to\nunsustainable management practices, and because industrialized countries have\ndrafted and implemented legislation to hamper tropical timber trade from\nunsustainably-managed forest resources.\nThe proposed A\/R project activity intends to supply a high demand international\nmarket with wood from sustainably-managed forestry plantations planted with native\ntree species.\nStep 4: Assessment of previous land use and project entity\u2019s land use practices within\nthe project boundaries\nProject activities are carried out in two areas:\n\u2022 Cravo Norte: the previous land use was extensive cattle farming, as can be\nseen from Maps 5 and 6. These lands were acquired to conduct forestry\nactivities.\n\u2022 C\u00e1ceres: The previous land use was extensive cattle farming with some gold\nmining activities, as illustrated in Maps 8 and 9.\nFor further information please see 1.16\nStep 5: Identification of plausible and credible land-use alternatives\nAccording to data from territory maps and satellite study, as well as feedback given\nby stakeholders, the most favorable alternatives of land use with regard to current and\npotential land use are:\n\u2022 Livestock farming activities in Cravo Norte and C\u00e1ceres\n\u2022 Gold mining activities in C\u00e1ceres\n80\n\nVCS Project Description Template\nMap 22: Land cover of Colombia, 2009102\nMap 23: Image US2, land use in tropical Latin America103\n102 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. 2009:\nhttp:\/\/www.fao.org\/geonetwork\/srv\/es\/graphover.show?id=37154&fname=lc_Colombia.png&access=public\n103 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. 2000. Essential documents, statistics, maps and\nmultimedia resources. www.fao.org\/english\/newsroom\/extras\/200506_deforestation\/deforestation1.htm\n81\n\nVCS Project Description Template\nStep 6: Identification of the baseline scenario as the most likely land-use in the\nabsence of the project activity\nThe baseline scenario, in the absence of the project activity, would be extensive\nlivestock farming, and in some areas in C\u00e1ceres gold mining. This land use is\ncommon practice around and within the project territories.\nExtensive livestock farming has some negative environmental effects. Deforested\nareas are first used for agricultural purposes and later transformed to conduct\nextensive activities such as cattle farming. The decrease of the overall forest area is\nattributed to the expansion of livestock farming. The area suitable for cattle farming\nhas already been exceeded. Consequently, it has reduced areas with a superior\npotential for other kinds of activities, such as forestry (see Table 15: Comparison\nbetween the current land use and the potential land use in Colombia in Step 1).\nPlease refer to 1.9 for gold mining (Program of plantation and forest handling in\ndegraded soils caused by alluvial gold mining - recovery-, C\u00e1ceres).\nThe steps laid out in Baseline Methodology AR-AM0005 provide for the\nidentification of the baseline scenario in a conservative and transparent manner. The\nelaboration of the analysis above, following the steps indicated in the methodology\nleaves only two possible baseline scenarios: extensive livestock grazing and, in\nlimited areas in the C\u00e1ceres project area, alluvial gold mining. These are the only\nplausible baseline scenarios based on the guidance of the Baseline Methodology and\nare therefore the most conservative of the plausible baseline scenarios. Furthermore,\nthese baseline scenarios will not lead to an overestimation of the carbon stock changes\nbecause there is no other baseline scenario in which the carbon stock would be higher.\nTo the contrary, in the areas that were subject to gold mining, the baseline scenario\nselection is more likely to underestimate the carbon stock changes from reforestation\nbecause of the existence of bare soils (see section 2.2 for further discussion of the\nconservativeness of the gold mining baseline scenario).\n2.5. Description of how the emissions of GHG by source in baseline scenario\nare reduced below those that would have occurred in the absence of the\nproject activity (assessment and demonstration of additionality):\nThe procedure to demonstrate additionality follows EB 35 Report Annex 17 with the\nA\/R Methodological Tool \u201cTool for the Demonstration and Assessment of\nAdditionality in A\/R CDM Project Activities\u201d (Version 02). The following five basic\nsteps as outlined in the additionality tool are followed to demonstrate that the\nproposed A\/R CDM project activity is additional and not the baseline scenario:\n\u2022 Step 0: Preliminary screening based on the starting date of the A\/R project\nactivity;\n\u2022 Step 1: Identification of alternative land use scenarios to the A\/R project\nactivity;\n\u2022 Step 2: Investment analysis to determine that the proposed project activity is\nnot the most economically or financially attractive of the identified land use\nscenarios; or\n\u2022 Step 3: Barriers analysis; and\n\u2022 Step 4: Common practice analysis.\n82\n\nVCS Project Description Template\nStep 0: Preliminary screening based on the starting date of the A\/R project\nactivity\nThis step determines the land eligibility prior to the starting of the A\/R CDM project\nactivity. The land within the project boundary is defined as grassland (see also 2.4).\nAs a result of the multi-temporal land use change analysis, developed using satellite\nimages, the land proposed for the forestry activity was found in 97% in Caceres and\n93% in Arauca to be eligible 1992 (see also 1.16).\nThe project activity started in 2002. Income from carbon sequestration is mentioned\nin the contracts of participation. First contracts were signed in January 2002 by the\ninvestors. In May 2007, the company \u201cCarbono & Bosque\u201d delivered an analysis of\ncarbon sequestration potential and an eligibility study of the area. The project PIN\nwas sent to the Colombian DNA on June 1, 2007. A Letter of No-Objection was\nobtained on June 5, 2007, because in the beginning it was planned to register the\nproject under the CDM. Therefore it is stated in the letter that the project will claim\ncarbon credits under the Kyoto protocol. After 2007 the project developer decided to\nregister the project under the voluntary market scheme, because he expects a higher\ndemand and better prices from buyers that are willing to mitigate voluntarily, in\ncomparison to buyers acting in the compliance market. Demand for tCERs and lCERs\nfrom forest-related project activities under the CDM appears to be quite low. A reason\nfor this limited demand is the rule that A\/R projects can only claim temporary credits\nto assure permanence of emission reduction. After the crediting period of a forest-\nrelated project activity has ended, CERs have to be replaced by permanent CERs from\nproject activities other than A\/R. Furthermore, the EU Emission Trading System\ncurrently does not allow for A&R CERs to be used for compliance, further reducing\ndemand.\nStep 1: Identification of alternative land use scenarios to the proposed A\/R\nproject activity\nSub-step 1a: Identify credible alternative land use scenarios to the proposed project\nactivity\nSee chapter 2.4, Step 2\nSub-step 1b: Consistency of credible land use scenarios with enforced mandatory\napplicable laws and regulations\nSee 2.4(a)(b)\nSub-step 1c: Selection of the baseline scenario\nSee 2.4\nStep 2: Investment analysis\nN\/A\nStep 3: Barrier analysis\nSub-step 3a: Identify barriers that would prevent the implementation of type of the\nproposed project activity\n83"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}"}]}

The main technological barriers were\nthe non-availability of human knowledge to operate and maintain the new\ntechnology, the internal and external logistic modification and the\nemployee\u2019s resistance to the new technology.\nBefore the project activity, the process was noticeably different:\nnative wood was delivered in the plant; it was inserted in the kilns by\nthe employees and it was not necessary any machine experience or\nlogistic modification in order to attend the project\u2019s needs, e.g. the\nnew biomass must be stored in cover sites and needs to be dried in\norder to achieve a better burn efficiency, which required more low-\nskilled labor.\nThe operators did not have knowledge of the ideal amount of renewable\nbiomass that was necessary to achieve the ideal temperature for its\nceramic units firing, to acquire the final product with same quality\nand to maintain the optimal process as they did when using native wood.\nAs a consequence of this barrier, there were variations in the color of\nthe final ceramic devices, affecting the quality of the products;\ncracks on the ceramic devices; the explosion of some of them and cracks\nalong the kilns; adding a significant amount of insecurity in\nproduction process. A pyrometric system (thermocouples) was installed\nin order to control the burning due to the lack of experience with the\nnew fuel.\nDiverging from the baseline scenario, in the project activity, the\nsawdust and wood chips are fed to the kilns by automatic machineries,\nthe mechanic burners, which are fed manually by an operator, had to be\ninstalled. Also, the machineries needed some adjustments in order to\nuse the new biomasses, fuels that are uncommonly employed for the\ninitial propose of the machines.\n16\n\nItuiutaba Ceramic - VCS Project Description\nThe employees must be careful not to fill the devices with large\namounts of biomass, which can clog the mechanic burner and\nconsequently, cause disorder in the burning process and that was one of\nthe causes of the production losses throughout the adaptation period.\nSo, the mechanic burner\u2019s feeding has to be done gradually, demanding\neven more time and labor from the employees.\nAs a result of the fuel switch, some training courses were required for\nthe staffs in order to clarify new measures linked to the machinery,\nsustaining the quality of the final product.\nFurthermore, there was a lack of infrastructure to utilize the new\ntechnology. The region of Ituiutaba is commonly known for not being\nupdated with new technologies in the Ceramic sector and very resistant\nto changes or improvements to its work process and general practices.\nThis way, a set of adaptations were necessary, such as adjustments in\nthe kiln entrances to embed mechanic burners and the construction of\nsheds to store and to dry biomasses and consequently improve their\nburning efficiency.\nMoreover, the use of new biomasses represented a high risk to the\nceramic owner once, although, there is currently a great amount of\nthese types of biomasses available locally, it is possible the\nunavailability of the biomasses. It may happen because thermal energy\ngeneration through the combustion of renewable biomasses is an\ninnovation in ceramic industry and their future demand (e.g. by other\nconsumers) is not easy to foresee.\nThis means that Ituiutaba Ceramic had to find the best procedure to\nhandle with the new technology, i.e. the new biomass, logistic and\nmachines. An adaptation period was necessary to learn how to utilize\nthe new fuel and employ it in the process.\nAll these changes were made counting on this project approval in order\nto the ceramic become able to receive the biomass to be used. Ituiutaba\nCeramic, with this project activity, intends to develop its burning\nprocess and its machineries in order to reduce losses.\nThe ceramic sector is very resistant to changes and improvements in its\nwork process. The modifications required for the fuel switch are an\ninnovation in the region and represent a first step in the sector to\nrevert this situation. This way, it will also stimulate regional\ndevelopment.\n\u2022 Financial barrier\nDue to the implementation of the project activity, the ceramic had\nto purchase machines to automatically inject the biomass with air\ninside the kilns, once when using wood, the fuel was manually\ninserted by operators in the kilns, a procedure which is unfeasible\nwhen employing sawdust and wood chips. The project proponent also\nacquired thermocouples and constructed a shed for the biomass\nstorage.\nWhen the new production techniques were introduced at the ceramic\nplant, there was an adaptation period and a testing period. For the\nadaptation of the kilns a still period of a burning cycle for each\nkiln had to be considered. Also the testing period of approximately\nthree months, required in order to identify the correct burning\ncurve, lead to waste of considerable production (average 5%) per\nmonth. All this resulted in prejudice for the company financial\nprofit and loss balance.\nDue to all mentioned reasons the ceramic industry had to deal with a\nhigh investment that made the ceramic responsible think about\nstopping the fuel switching project.\n17\n\n[['', None, None], ['Investment Costs', None, None], ['', None, None], ['Costs with shed construction', '25.288', 'BRL'], ['Costs with equipment acquisition (including\\nfreight)', '90.280', 'BRL'], ['Costs with Kiln adaptation', '22.920', 'BRL'], ['Electronic Burn Monitoring system', '42.789', 'BRL'], ['Loss of revenues - period for adaptation of\\nthe kiln for biomass', '18.200', 'BRL'], ['Waste of products in the testing period (3\\nmonths)', '15.000', 'BRL'], ['Total Invested', '214.477', 'BRL']]\nItuiutaba Ceramic - VCS Project Description\nTable 7. Investment costs for the project activity at Ituiutaba Ceramic\n\u2022 Institutional barrier\nSince the kilns had to be adapted to burn the new biomasses, and\nthere was a lack of qualified work force, and skilled labor to\nmanage these new logistic, it was necessary to submit some workers\nto training and capacitating.\nThe new biomass presented a larger volume changing the established\nlogistic system of the ceramics.\nThese arrangements require the ceramics\u2019 employees to have or get\nspecific expertise and knowledge where such experience is lacking.\nBecause of this, promoting the new arrangement involves a\nsignificant institutional barrier.\n\u2022 Risk of the project\nThe project activity implementation presented a risk to the project\nproponent, once the use of a new type of fuel and its machines added\na significant amount of insecurity to the production process, while\nthe use of native firewood is a traditional and commonly-known\nprocess. Furthermore, the ceramics can overgrow a period in which\nthere is possibility that there is lack of biomass, representing\nanother risk period.\nIt must be re-emphasized that there is no direct subsidy or support\nfrom the government for this project, and without the income from\nthe commercialization of the carbon credits, the fuel switch at\nItuiutaba Ceramic would not be feasible or attractive to the project\nproponent.\n\u2022 Barrier due to the price of the biomass\nThe thermal energy generation through the combustion of renewable\nbiomasses such as sawdust is an innovation in the ceramic industry.\nThe future demand of these alternative fuels e.g. by other consumers\nis not easy to foresee. Although there is currently a great amount\nof this type of biomass available locally, there is a possibility\nthat the prices would increase as well, especially between harvests\nperiods, when the problem with biomass disposal is mitigated. If the\nprice of the biomass increases, the ceramics cannot re-pass it, once\nthe ceramics would not have competitive prices in relation to others\nwhich did not made the fuel switch.\nStep 3: Common Practice\n18"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

Eligible ALM activities are those that reduce net GHG\nemissions on cropland and grassland by increasing carbon stocks in soils and woody biomass\nand\/or decreasing CO2, N2O and\/or CH4 emissions from soils.\nUnder the ALM, this project falls under the activity category: Improved Cropland Management\n(ICM). This category includes practices that demonstrably reduce net GHG emissions of cropland\nsystems by increasing soil carbon stocks, reducing soil N2O emissions, and\/or reducing CH4\nemissions. Among these, the project focuses on the following:\na) Practices that increase soil carbon stocks by increasing field residue inputs to soils\nand\/or reducing soil carbon mineralization rates, and introduction of agroforestry\npractices.\nb) Practices that reduce N2O emissions by improved fertilizer management through\nreduction in total nitrogen additions by substitution with compost manure, timely\napplication and improved placement.\nREDD+ component\nThe AFOLU category is Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD).\nThe REDD Project activity type is Avoided Unplanned Deforestation (AUD), since the land in the\nproject is not legally authorized or documented to be converted to non-forest in the baseline.\nThe entire project is a grouped project as defined by the VCS Standard (version 4.2): \u201cgrouped\nprojects are projects structured to allow the expansion of a project activity subsequent to project\nvalidation. Validation is based upon the initial project activity instances identified in the project\ndescription. The project description sets out the geographic areas within which new project\nactivity instances may be developed and the eligibility criteria for their inclusion. New instances\nmeeting these pre-established criteria may then be added to the project subsequent to project\nvalidation\u201d.\n2\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nThe first project activity instance for the SALM component comprises 19,059 ha of agricultural\nland, and 232,065 ha of forest areas for the REDD+ component which are found within 26\nCommunity Conservation Areas in the sixteen chiefdoms listed in section 1.1. The geographic\narea for all project activity instances is defined as the boundaries of the sixteen chiefdoms."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}"}]}

This last basin is of great importance worldwide because\nthere are endemic vegetation patterns, which are developed under very humid climatic conditions,\noligotrophic soils, very acidic and on black, white and clear water systems (Aymard & Arellano,\n2018)27.\nThe project area is located in the department of Guain\u00eda, limited to the North with the Department\nof Vichada, through the natural demarcation of the Guain\u00eda River, to the South with the Republic of\nBrazil, to the East with the border with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, delimited by the\nAtabapo, Guain\u00eda and the Upper Negro Rivers and to the West with the departments of Vaup\u00e9s,\nGuaviare and Vichada\nThe project is located in the Northeast sector of the Colombian Amazon in the UTM coordinates\n(datum WGS 84-Zone 19 N 72-66 W) 446904.063 North, 187122,061 South, 368685.366 West and\n687682.167 East28.\nThe project as a whole (project and leakage area) is over 3,408,186.15 ha.\nThe project is being implemented over an area of 1,815,704.61 ha, the leakage area is\n1,592,481.54 ha, the leakage area represents 87.70 % without savannah formation29.\nGiven the pressure exerted by deforestation agents, mining, immigration land use activity, and the\nimminent and demonstrated threat of land use change due to the dryness of the soil, increased\nforest fires or excessive flooding (in extension and permanence) and from imminent climate\nchange, the project seeks to protect the native vegetation and ecosystem types of the area, in order\nto prevent the effects of deforestation and forest degradation that lead to emissions of greenhouse\ngases (GHG). It is sought through the implementation of socio-economic activities with the native\npeoples of the area, the promotion of economic activities that are consistent with the conservation\nof natural coverage and rapid and effective adaptation to climate change. In this project, illegal\nmining30 activity is defined as the main direct threat and unplanned agent of deforestation and\ndegradation in the region, followed by the transformative effects of climate change.\nIn general, the project region is dominated by an exceptional state of conservation due to its large\npreserved territories, due to the good management and adaptation of the indigenous communities\nthat inhabit there the environmental supply provided by these ecosystems. The forests are mostly\nin a state of equilibrium or climax. However, the pressure and imminent threat present in the region\nof Guain\u00eda is also present in the rest of the Colombian Amazon, where productive activities of a\nbusiness nature obtain access to land, usually through legal permits, forced occupation and illegal\n26 Note: Brazil and Venezuela territories are not included in the project activities (Map)\n27 File: Aymard and Arellano, 2018\n28 File: Map Geocoordinates\n29 Note: Refer to file No. 23\n30 File: Mining Threat\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 14\n\nCCB + VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nobtaining of titles of property, which also find in this region cheap labor, low price of the land and\ntax exemption or evasion. The profits generated by the exploitation of natural resources are not\nreinvested in the territories from which they are obtained, keeping their inhabitants immersed in\npoverty (0.03 of participation in the national GDP), unemployment (36.17%), malnutrition (6% of\nchildren with chronic malnutrition), illiteracy (24.07%) and with limited access to other social and\nhealth services (60.62% of people in NBI); forcing the indigenous population to accept gifts or perks\nin exchange for the establishment of illegal activities in their territories, mainly crops and\nlaboratories for the processing of coca and illegal extraction of wood and gold (CGP, 2012, DANE\nBulletin, 2005; of Departmental Development, 2012, Geoamazonia, 2009)31.\nThe main objectives proposed in the project in relation to climate, biodiversity and community are:\nClimate:\n- Reduce GHG emissions during the lifetime of the project (100 years), maintenance of carbon\nstock reserves due to the avoidance of forest deforestation and degradation.\n- Preserve over the time the microclimatic quality by controlling the deforestation and the\ndegradation of natural coverage in the project region.\n- Contribute in the regional meso-climatic equilibrium and therefore worldwide, during the project\nlifetime.\n- Preserve the environmental service conditions, supplied by the natural coverage of the project\narea.\nBiodiversity:\n- Preserve the ecosystems and therefore the habitat of multiple species, reducing the pressure\nexerted by deforestation and forest degradation.\n- Develop and preserve high conservation values and contribute to the expansion of scientific\nknowledge about the biodiversity of the region.\nCommunity:\n- Design and implement productive alternatives that allow the adequate use of the soil of the\ninhabitants of the project area. It seeks a significant improvement in their economic resources and\ntheir quality of life.\n- Promote the permanence of forests and their sustainable use by strengthening indigenous\ngovernance.\n- Strengthen the knowledge of the population about the multiple environmental services offered by\nthe natural coverage to the community and the world.\n31 File: Baseline Scenario Information\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 15\n\nCCB + VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\n- Safeguard the preservation of the culture, customs and traditional knowledge of the indigenous\npeople at least during the project lifetime.\nFinally, it is emphasized that if the project activity does not occur, the territory would face an\nunprecedented danger in the history of Colombia that would result in an increase in the degradation\nand deforestation of these unique ecosystems in the planet. The urgency of the project is\nrepresented by the threat to the region due to extractive\/mining activity, in this case open-pit mining.\nIt is important to highlight that we do not prohibit any type of activity, the project is an open proposal\nwith different economic activities, it seeks that the communities understand and choose the\neconomic activities that really improve their quality of life and preserves the forest.\nIt is estimated an annual average and total GHG emission reductions of 8,089,391 tCO , and for 2\nthe 100 years of the crediting period 808,939,153 tCO . 2"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_country': 'Colombia'}"}]}

The project proponent of this project is SK Forest. The main goals of this\nproject are:\n\uf0b7 To mitigate climate change by removing GHG through mangrove planting\n\uf0b7 To restore degraded mangrove forests and improve biodiversity\n\uf0b7 To support the livelihood of local residents through the creation of local jobs and\nincome generation\nThe project aims to restore the ecosystem and support local livelihoods by planting mangrove\ntrees in degraded mangrove ecosystems. Approximately 566 hectares of mangrove are to be\nrestored by planting mangrove seedlings in areas where mangroves have been lost in past\ndecades on the northern and southern coasts of Timor-Leste. According to a land cover\nclassification model developed through the project, mangrove forests in Timor-Leste are rapidly\ndecreasing, with a 4.93% yearly deforestation rate.\nThe selected project areas are suitable for mangrove growth, firstly determined by GIS analysis,\nincluding tide zone analysis and mangrove habitats suitability index and field survey to confirm.\nAccording to the interview with local communities, threats to mangroves in project areas\ninclude seasonal sediment accumulation, illegal logging, and livestock grazing. Notably, local\ncommunities in Baucau rely on rice cultivation for their livelihoods, making the conversion into\nfarmland a significant threat.\nThe characteristic of Timor-Leste\u2019s mangrove forest is the zoning by the distance from the\nshoreline influenced by the high tide, submerging periods, and duration. Mangrove zoning\npartitions the distribution of mangrove species, forming a unique habitat. The expected planting\nspecies and stratification are designed in accordance with the natural zoning of the mangroves.\nThe planting species of the project mainly consist of Rhizophora apiculata, Ceriops tagal, and\nAvicennia marina. R. apiculata will be planted near the shoreline, as the species require\nsufficient moisture, while C. tagal and A. marina will be planted further inland, as this species\nis highly resistant to drought and salinity.\nThe project\u2019s total GHG removals by sinks are estimated ex-ante as 308,020 tCO2-e over its\ncrediting period of 30 years at an estimated average of 10,267 tCO2-e annually. The project\napplies VM0033 methodology, and the start date for the project is January 1, 2025.\n4\n\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.3"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_country': 'Timor-Leste'}"}]}

The end-user technology in the case of this project can\nbe established as the project proponent, who utilizes the thermal\nenergy generated by the new renewable energy technology.\nThere are no similar registered small-scale CDM project activities in\nthe region of Paudalho once Social Carbon Company made a research and\ndid not find any registered small\u2013scale CDM Project activity in the\nregion. The sources of registered small-scale CDM project activity\nconsulted were the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange (UNFCCC)25 and Brazilian\u2019s Technology and Science Ministry26.\nTherefore, the proposed project activity is not saving the non-\nrenewable biomass accounted by the other registered project activities.\nThe utilization of firewood from area without any kind of management\ncan not be considered a renewable source of biomass, since it involves\na decrease of carbon pools and increases the carbon emissions to the\natmosphere, turning green house effect even worse. Moreover, the native\nwood provided from areas without a reforestation management plan does\nnot fit any of the options of UNFCCC definition of renewable biomass in\nAnnex 18, EB 23.\nAccording to historical data from Bom Jesus ceramic industry, the\nceramic facilities used to utilize non-renewable native wood from areas\nwithout any kind of management since 1986.\nThis way, it can be concluded that non-renewable biomass has been used\nsince before 31st December, 1989. Thus, the project activity is in\nagreement under the methodology applicability requirements.\nThe biomasses utilized in the project, sugar cane briquette, Algaroba\nwood, Eucalyptus wood, native wood with sustainable management plan,\n25 CDM activities registered by CDM Executive board are Available at:<\nhttp:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/Projects\/registered.html>.Visited on March 27th, 2009.\n26 Brazilian\u00b4s Technology and Science Ministry is responsible for registry and\napproval of all CDM activities within Brazilian boundaries.

In the third stage, the allocated area is divided\nfor exploration in blocks in order to sustain forest exploitation\nannually27.\nAfterwards, a technical responsible elaborates the next stages: forest\ninventory, estimation of growth, the best intervention techniques,\nfixes the arrangement of exploration and the silvicultural treatment.\nAn annual technical report of the sustainable forest management area is\nelaborated and it is necessary a yearly authorization of the\nenvironmental agency of the state to keep the activities.\nIn addition, the sustainable forest management promotes the\nconservation of biodiversity, conservation of soil and water regime,\nwhich are essential practises to combat the desertification. Moreover,\nthere is an increment at the opportunity of employment for the rural\npopulation due to the sustainable exploration of plants destined for\nfruits, apiculture, medicinal, oil, ornamental and fiber production\npurposes28.\nFurthermore, the minimum requirements of the management plan are\ndefined by Articles 19, 20 and 21 of Brazilian Forest Code, and are\nregulated by Decree 5975\/0629.\nThe Eucalyptus wood fits all the three options above since just wood\nfrom Eucalyptus plantation areas are utilized, i.e. the area remains a\nEucalyptus plantation with the use of the biomass. The area destined\nfor afforestation in Brazil corresponds to 5.6 millions of hectares,\nwhere the Eucalyptus genus corresponds to 3.5 millions of this area,\nand can generate 23 to 25 tons of biomass per hectare30.

Moreover, the areas\nwhere the cashew trees fallows sustainable management practices,\naccording to is cultivation and harvest techniques, where the pruning\nof cashew trees is necessary in order to allow an appropriate formation\nof the tree and maintaining favorable conditions for the next harvest\nperiod 34 . This way, in cashew cultivation must be cut undesirable\nbranches of the cashew trees.\nBesides, Brazilian\u2019s production presents the tendency of increasing so\nfar, carried by the new technologies utilized and the higher national\nand international demand of cashew nuts 35 . This way, the Brazilian\nsources of residues from cashew trees will increase following the\nBrazilian production, due the fact that cashew cultivation requests it.\nThe elephant grass is considered renewable according to option III, as\nsoon as it fit all the assumptions below:\n\u201cThe biomass is non-woody biomass and originates from croplands and\/or\ngrasslands where:\n(a) The land area remains cropland and\/or grasslands or is reverted to\nforest; and\n(b) Sustainable management practices are undertaken on these land areas\nto ensure in particular that the level of carbon stocks on these land\n31 FOLKEL.

(EB 31)\nAs per Para 1 & 2 of \u2018Technology \/ measure\u2019 in pg 1 of the referred methodology:\n(cid:2) This category comprises renewable energy generation units, such as photovoltaics, hydro,\ntidal\/wave, wind, geothermal, and renewable biomass, that supply electricity to and\/or displace\nelectricity from an electricity distribution system that is or would have been supplied by at least\none fossil fuel or non-renewable biomass fired generating unit.\n7\n\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-PDD) - Version 03\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board\nJustification:\nThe project activity is a renewable source of energy (wind power), which supplies electricity to\nan electricity distribution system (grid). The proposed project will export 12.72 MUs per annum\nof electricity to the respective grid from a renewable source (Wind Energy); this electricity will\nbe supplied to the Southern and Northern Region Electricity Grid, where the major part of\nelectricity comes from non-renewable electricity generation.\n(cid:2) If the unit added has both renewable and nonrenewable components, the eligibility limit of 15\nMW for a small scale CDM project activity applies only to the renewable component. If the unit\nadded co-fires (non-) renewable biomass and fossil fuel, the capacity of the entire unit shall not\nexceed the limit of 15MW\nJustification:\nThis project activity is has only renewable energy component of installed capacity 81 MW (< 15\nMW).\nSo, in light of the above the applicability of this type & category of methodology to this project\nis justified\nTechnology Used:\nIn wind energy generation, kinetic energy of wind is converted into mechanical energy and\nsubsequently into electrical energy. Wind has considerable amount of kinetic energy when\nblowing at high speeds. This kinetic energy when passes through the blades of the wind turbines,\nit is converted into mechanical energy and rotates the wind blades. When the wind blades rotate,\nthe connected generator also rotates, the rotor and the generator are connected through the gear\nbox.

This category comprises renewable energy generation units, such as photovoltaics, hydro,\ntidal\/wave, wind, geothermal and renewable biomass, that supply electricity to and\/or\ndisplace electricity from an electricity distribution system that is or would have been supplied\nby at least one fossil fuel fired generating unit.\n2. If the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a wind\/diesel\nunit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small- scale CDM project activity applies only to the\nrenewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel5, the capacity of the entire unit\nshall not exceed the limit of 15MW.\n3. Combined heat and power (co- generation) systems are not eligible under this category.\n4. In the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy generation\nunits at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added capacity of the units added\nby the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be physically distinct6from the\nexisting units.\n5. Project activities that seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for renewable energy\ngeneration are included in this category. To qualify as a small scale project, the total output of\nthe modified or retrofitted unit shall not exceed the limit of 15 MW.\nThis project activity comes under point number 1 of the technology \/measures of AMS I-D.\nThe applicability of this methodology may be explained through the following arguments\n\u2022 The project activity involves electricity generation using renewable energy which is\nbased on wind power and sale of the electricity generated to the Tamil Nadu\nelectricity Board (TNEB). This project activity displaces the equivalent amount of\n5 Co-fired system uses both fossil and renewable fuels.\n6 Physically distinct units are those that are capable of generating electricity without the operation of\nexisting units, and that do not directly affect the mechanical, thermal, or electrical characteristics of the\nexisting facility. For example, the addition of a steam turbine to an existing combustion turbine to\ncreate a combined cycle unit would not be considered \u201cphysically distinct\u201d.\n11\n\nVCS Project Description Template\nelectricity generation through the operation of existing\/proposed fossil fuel based\npower plants connected to the Grid.\n\u2022 The project activity involves installation of renewable energy generation units only\n(Wind Turbine Generators)\n\u2022 The project activity doesn\u2019t involve cogeneration system. The project activity\ninvolves electricity generation from the Wind Turbine Generators.\n\u2022 The project activity doesn\u2019t involve addition of renewable energy generation units at\nexisting power generation facility.\n\u2022 The project activity doesn\u2019t seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for\nrenewable energy generation.\n\u2022 The total installed capacity of the project activity is 3.75 MW which is less than the\neligibility limit of 15 MW to qualify as a small scale project activity under Type I of\nthe small scale methodologies Also no additional WTGs will be added to the project\nactivity during its lifetime; Hence the project activity will remain under small scale\nproject activity during every year of crediting period.\nHence it can be concluded that the selected methodology, AMS I D \u2013 Grid Connected\nRenewable Electricity Generation is applicable to project activity"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

Technologies and\/or measures\n>>\nThe project activity is a Greenfield project for generation of electrical energy using wind which is a\nrenewable source of energy. Thus, this project actually displaces the electricity grid which is\nessentially fossil-fuel based.\nIn wind energy generation, kinetic energy of the wind is converted into mechanical energy and\nsubsequently into electrical energy. Wind turbines capture the wind's energy with three propeller-\nlike blades, which are mounted on a rotor, to generate electricity. The turbines sit high atop towers,\ntaking advantage of the stronger and less turbulent wind. As the wind blows through the blades of\nthe windmill, a pocket of low-pressure air forms on the downwind side of the blade. The low-\npressure air pocket then pulls the blade towards it, causing the rotor to spin. The rotor turns the\nshaft that further spins the connected generator. The spinning of this generator produces the\nrequired electricity.

The project is intended as a grouped one, in which the long-term vision is to manage multiple\nsectors of eastern CAR in the prefectures of Mbomou, Haute-Kotto and Haut-Mbomou (See in Figure 1 the\ngeographical boundaries). African Parks has an agreement with the CAR government in place since 2014\nfor the protection of four hunting zones and signed a new one in 2020 for the inclusion of new ones.\nThe conditions prior to the implementation of the project had several factors that impacted the well-being\nof communities and community groups living on the periphery of the project area. These include insecurity\nin the region, persistent conflict between transhumant pastoralists and local communities, lack of education\nand employment opportunities, and poor healthcare. These factors had an impact on the ecosystems and\nbiodiversity of the region as well, where practices like unsustainable hunting and an economy of illegal\nwildlife trade, transhumant pastoralism and unsustainable agricultural activities were performed widely.\nThe overall objective of the project is to secure a core protected area in eastern CAR and to actively engage\nin the land use planning and sustainable management of the surrounding areas in order to restore and\nimprove ecosystem functions and habitat, through community engagement, law enforcement and\nrestoration and conservation activities. Below are the specific objectives.\nClimate objectives: Enhance the restoration of natural ecosystems, leading to increasing the CO storage 2\nand avoiding the emissions resulting from disturbance and conversion.\nCommunity objectives: Improve the lives, livelihoods and safety of local communities by implementing\ncommunity projects, land use planning and sustainable resources management.\nBiodiversity objectives: Enhance the conditions for conservation and habitat management including\nrestoration and maintenance of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services while improving the\npopulation of endangered species.\nThe measures to be implemented by the project are focused on reducing the impact of the main agents\nand drivers of deforestation and conversion, by creating new and more sustainable opportunities for those\nagents in the wider landscape. These activities include sensitisation of the local communities and\ntranshumance pastoralists, the establishment of pastoralism corridors and more sustainable natural\nresource use. Moreover, the project will increase employment opportunities, continuation of biodiversity\nmonitoring and restoration of natural areas among others. The success in the implementation of these\nactivities is expected to generate greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions reductions (Check section 2.1.11 for\nmore details of the project activities).\nUpon the implementation of the project activities described above, the project is expected to generate an\nestimated annual average of net emissions reduction of 442,839 tCO2e and a total of 4,558,205 tCO2e for\nSep 2016 \u2013 Dec 2026 period, according to the Non-Permanence Risk assessment the buffer discount\nobtained was 6.5% but the minimum assumed is 10%, therefore, after applying the buffer the average\namount of tradable VCUs per year during this period is 398,553 and totalling 4,102,366 for Sep 2016 \u2013 Dec\n2026 period.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3\n11\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nFigure 1: Project location14 showing the project area, the project accounting areas and the expected geographical\nboundaries of expansion of the grouped project in the East of Central African Republic (prefectures of Mbomou,\nHaute-Kotto and Haut-Mbomou).\n(Source: South Pole, 2023)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_state_province': 'Mbomou', 'project_country': 'Central African Republic'}"}]}

The country\nborders with Zambia, Tanzania and Mozambique, these last two separated by Lake Malawi, which is the\ndominant geographical feature of the country.\nProject areas are located in the following districts, constituting the area of the Grouped Project: Rumphi,\nMzimba, Kasungu, Nkhotakota, Dowa, Salima, Lilongwe, Ntcheu\/Dedza, Mangochi and Machinga. These\ndistricts are located on the map in Figure 2b.\nFigure 2: Location of the Grouped Project Area\nFigure 2a: Location of Malawi in East Africa\nv3.0 15\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nFigure 2b: Grouped Project Area: District Level Map\nDetermination of the Forest Cover 10 years prior to Project Initiation\nTo generate to Forest Cover map for Malawi Landsat images of 1995 \u2013 1997 were obtained and the\nfollowing processes were performed using the image processing software IDRISI Kilimanjaro.\nv3.0 16\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nThree bands were extracted (1, blue 2, green and 3, red band) for all the images involved. After the\nimportation process, the images were re-projected from Zone 36, North to 36, South (i.e. these bands are\nacquired with a wrong projection, North instead of South).\nThen the individual bands (1s, 2s and 3s) were mosaicked to form a relatively large areal coverage\n(mosaicking process is conducted on bands and not on composed images).\nAfter mosaicking the three bands were then composed into an image with blueish shades as bare areas\nand red shades as areas covered with green vegetation (i.e. infra-red part of the electromagnetic\nspectrum is reflected by chlorophyll in green vegetation, hence, red implies chlorophyll presence).\nImages were then exported from IDRISI environment as TIFF\u2019s so that they can easily be imported into\nother software for further analysis.\nVisual Image Interpretation process\nThe process gives meaning to what is seen on the image using the colour, shape of features, texture, and\nrelationships with other known features among other elements.\nIn the exercise, once the images were now composites, the following were conducted;\n\u2022 Composed images were displayed in Arc View and the colours adjusted so that red pigment\nrepresenting vegetation comes out clearly for easy demarcation. This was done by increasing the\ncontrast of band 3.\n\u2022 Then manual digitizing of what looked like having a considerable amount of red pigment was\npicked and classified as an area covered with vegetation at the time the image was captured. In\nwhich case every site was treated individually.\nLocal knowledge application\nLandsat images have a resolution of 30x30 m, which is 900 m2. For each pixel an assessment was made,\nusing IDRISI Kilimanjaro, whether that area was covered by forest in the year the satellite image was\nrecorded. As the current forest cover is definitely different from the situation around 1997, it is not\npossible to ground truth the analysis. In that respect the current situation and knowledge of the land is\nessential and must be combined with the information contained by the images.\nNot all that has chlorophyll are trees; grass too displays a lot of red pigment just as trees with fresh leaves\ndo. The generic principle that has been applied is to assess the absorption\/reflection of areas that are\nsurely covered by a particular vegetation type (e.g. tea plantations, pine\/eucalypt plantations) and analyse\neach pixel of the Landsat images of 1995 \u2013 1997 against that \u2018finger print\u2019 or \u2018signature\u2019. This way, all\nareas that were covered 10 years ago by that vegetation type are classified. Using the existing local\nknowledge the entire country has been assessed like that. For instance, in this exercise, marshy areas\nwere excluded by knowing where these marshes are in Malawi. e.g. the occurrence of Elephant and\nNdindi Marshes in the lower shire and the surrounding areas of Lake Chilwa amongst other water bodies.\nPlantations such as sugar and tea, which have some considerable areal coverage, were also excluded.\nIllovo Sugar plantation in Chikwawa and Nkhotakota were excluded from what was classified as forest\nareas and so was tea in Thyolo and Mulanje.\nSome sites though covered by forest may display different colours depending upon the species of trees\non the site. Pine plantation in Mzimba and Nkhata Bay (Chikangawa) may not display that bright red\npigment as Eucalyptus (Bluegum) or other broadleaved tree species do. Implying that colour display\nalone may not provide a complete picture of what forest coverage is.\nOther sites like Nyika plateau have a mixture of trees and grass; lower slopes, and the river valleys have\nwoodlands while the plateau is predominantly grass. One has to make decisions on some sites such as\nthose with thorny bushes whether to classify them as forests or not which tends to be subjective. In this\nparticular case, to be on the safe side, such areas have been classified as forest and include those in the\nsouthern region, particularly Chikwawa, Mwanza and Neno where the thorny or thickets type of bushes\noccur.\nThe classification also included protected area boundaries, as most sites left for forest cover are actually\nprotected areas. E.g. Kasungu National Park and Dzyalanyama Forest reserve are distinct in their\ncoverage due to very clear borders between agriculture land and the protected areas. However, due to\nv3.0 17\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nhigh pressure for agricultural land as a result of high population density some of those areas are actually\nnot covered by forest anymore. However, in the forest map the protected areas have been included to\nascertain no Jatropha will be planted within such reserve areas. Finally, the forest cover map of 1997 has\nbeen combined with the areas that are now forest reserves (even if there is no forest there now) and the\narea that forms part of this project. The resulting map illustrates that none of the areas of the BERL\nproject overlay with protected areas, forest reserves, or areas that were covered by forest in 1997.\nThe pixel resolution has been instrumental in determining whether an area classifies as forest or not. For\nLandsat images the pixel resolution is 30x30 m (except for panchromatic band which has 15m pixel).\nPortions smaller than that were left out as they posed as isolated groups of trees not extensive enough to\nqualify.\nFuture instances must also fall outside the forest boundaries of the map describing the forest extent of 10\nyears before the start of the project.\nGeneral description of Malawi\u2019s geo-physical characteristics\nThe information provided here is general to Malawi because BERL operates in many districts. Annex 4\ncontains more detailed information per district where BERL operates. As outlined in Section 1.9, the\nareas planted with Jatropha on the boundaries of farmer fields are mainly covered with grasses that are\nburnt annually, and some shrub land.\nClimate, rainfall and temperature\nThe climate of Malawi is tropical and has two main seasons. The wet season starts in November and\nends in April-May, while the dry season occurs from May to October. Mean annual minimum and\nmaximum temperatures are between 10 and 35 degrees Celsius and distribution of rainfall (800 mm -\n1500 mm and above) varies widely over the districts. (EIA, 2009).\nVegetation\nMalawi has 2.4 million ha of surface water, and 9.4 million ha of land. Of the land area, 31% is suitable for\nthe country's rain-fed agriculture, 31% is marginal land and 37% is unfit for cultivation. The land that is\nunfit for cultivation is either under grass, shrubs, and\/or used as game reserves. Most of it is degraded:\npreviously cultivated but now providing very low productivity due to salinity, soil erosion, nutrient leaching\nand other factors.\nIn general, the vegetation and habitats in Malawi are divided in five main categories, namely: mountain\nforests, Brachystegia (miombo) woodlands, mopane woodland, dambo (wetlands), low altitude woodland\nand park land; but obviously only a small part of the land is actually covered by these vegetation types.\nBERL is targeting to plant Jatropha on the degraded land that is mostly covered by grasses and this is\nenvisaged to have an overall positive environmental impact (Biodiversity survey, 2008). More detail on\ndistrict specific vegetation can be found in Annex 4.\nv3.0 18\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nFigure 3: Location of Jatropha Polygons Included in this PD; Established in 2009\/10 Season in\nMalawi.

The principal project action is\nto shift livestock management from continuous grazing to planned rotational-rest grazing for cattle. This\nis done as a collective by the livestock farmers through adopting strategic herding and kraaling (practice\nof keeping cattle or other livestock in an enclosure overnight for protection) practices that align with the\ngrazing plan as determined and implemented by the livestock farmers. Planned rotational-rest grazing,\nalso called season-long grazing, is known to improve grazing lands through increasing the recovery rate\nand ground cover of sub-perennial and perennial grass species, which are more desirable forage.\nUsually, one camp will be rested from grazing during the growing season while an adjacent area is open\nto grazing. Camps may be rotated as agreed with communities through the Grazing Associations\n(Farmers Cooperatives); these associations are the drivers of the grazing systems within the landscape\nand are composed of locally elected community members who own livestock.\nThe project is located on the communal rangelands of the Kruger to Canyons (K2C) Biosphere Reserve\nin the Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces of South Africa. The K2C biosphere reserve is a landscape of\nsignificant global biodiversity stretching from the Kruger National Park in the east to the Blyde River\nCanyon in the west and includes a remarkably diverse suite of land uses ranging from formal\nconservation to peri-urban, urban, intensive commercial agriculture, subsistence agriculture, and livestock\nfarming land uses. The first project instance includes communal rangelands of the Mnisi and\nAmashangana tribal authority totaling 6432 ha. The project started in 2018 with the signing of the first\nconservation agreement between the Ahitiriheleni and Nhlanganani grazing associations and\nConservation South Africa (CSA). In addition, foundational steps were made towards enhancing internal\ngovernance of the grazing associations through capacity building, mentoring grazing associations on\ngood governance and formalizing a cooperative. The conservation agreements are the guiding framework\nfor the grazing plans and are negotiated with each grazing association to ensure each agreement is best\nsuited for the particular grazing association. The conservation agreements proposes a suite of benefits to\neach grazing association to promote compliance of the grazing plans; these benefits may differ slightly\nbetween each association. In partnership with Meat Naturally, the benefits are focused on supporting\nimproved livestock management in the form of market access for livestock, provision of fodder and\/or\nnutritional support, provision of eco-trainers and provision of animal production.\nThe baseline scenario (without project) in the communal rangelands is ongoing loss of soil organic carbon\n(SOC) due to low productivity and bare soil relative to reference sites, such as the Kruger National Park.\nUnrestricted animal movements and high grazing intensities disrupt recovery time for grasses during the\ngrowing season, thereby reducing vegetation and seed production of perennial and palatable grass\nspecies. This in turn results in relatively higher proportions of annuals vs. perennials and, eventually, bare\nsoil. Unrestricted grazing is occurring due to a \u2018tragedy of the commons\u2019 where communal areas are over-\nutilized for livestock grazing and knowledge of sustainable grazing practices has lapsed, largely due to\nthe legacy of Apartheid and the segregation of indigenous people into previous homelands and inequality\nof land ownership. The lack of vegetation and high occurrence of bare soil leads to high run-off and\nmassive loss of topsoil during the rainy season. This causes localized flooding events instead of\ninfiltration into the soils and creates siltation which reduces river flows and affects fauna and flora\ndownstream in protected and other areas. At the same time, unfavourable herd structures with lots of\nunproductive, old cattle cause high emissions for little to no extra beef produce.\nProject activities will restore the ecosystem functioning of the rangelands thus enhancing the resilience of\ncommunities that depend on the rangelands to the impacts of climate change. The project will also\ncontribute positively towards the livelihoods and long-term wellbeing of communities in the project area by\ncreating alternative sources of employment, building capacity in different skills as well as raising\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 8\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nawareness about conservation. This will also impact the project\u2019s biodiversity objectives to conserve\nendangered flora and fauna in the project zone while restoring vegetation biodiversity in the rangelands.\nThe project will sequester soil carbon by reducing bare soil and producing a natural shift from annual to\nperennial grass species as enabled by rotational grazing. Furthermore, greenhouse gas emissions from\nenteric fermentation will be reduced by changing the herd structure from older to younger animals.\nThe project will net sequester approximately 115,281 tCO e\/yr and 3,458,420 tCO e total over 30 years 2 2\naccording to current estimates of project extent."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_state_province': 'Mpumalanga', 'project_country': 'South Africa'}"}]}

Various benefits associated\nare as follows:\nSocial Well-being - Project activity would increase small fraction of employment for semi-\nskilled and skilled labour and professionals in the region by providing direct and indirect\nemployment.\nEconomic Well-being - The project activity brings in related economic benefits for the local\ncommunity and would lead to sustainable economic and industrial growth in the region. The\nproject activity shows less dependence of project proponent on grid-supplied electricity.\nEnvironmental Well-being- A major share of the region\u2019s electricity is generated from fossil\nfuel sources, mostly from coal based thermal power plants. The project activity would be\nable to displace\/ replace electricity generated by grid-connected power plant thus saving\nfurther exploitation and depletion of natural resources \u2013 coal, or else increasing its\navailability to other important processes.\n13\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\nTechnological Well-being- This project activity uses waste heat of the exit gases from\npreheater, AQC and the DG and utilizes that in WHR based captive power plant; it is an eco-\nfriendly technology in comparison to power generation in fossil fuel based projects. This not\nonly helps reduce environmental pollution but also helps in conserving fossil fuels.\nThe electricity generated from the project activity would help to reduce carbon dioxide\nemissions and other associated pollution at the thermal power plants; equivalent of which\nwould be emitted in absence of the project.\nAlso project activity would help to conserve water resources since the wastewater generated\nfrom the project activity would be reused for dust suppression.\nFurther Information\nThere are no information or incidents that will have bearing on the eligibility of the project,\nthe net GHG emission reductions or removals, or the quantification of the project\u2019s net GHG\nemission reductions or removals.\n2 SAFEGUARDS\n2.1 No Net Harm\nPlease refer to F 1 and F 2 of PDD of the UNFCCC registered CDM project with reference\nno. 0284.\nThe web link of the same is given below:\nhttps:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/Projects\/DB\/TUEV-SUED1140718710.42\/view"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

The SPF headquarters lie at the south-\nwestern entrance to the reserve in Keo Seima District at 106\u00b055'15.7\"E 12\u00b08'13.109\"N.\nThe methodology requires the definition of several non-overlapping management zones, as described\nin detail in Section 4.4 and summarized here. The project area (which is the area from which credits\nwill be generated), comprises those parts of the Core Protection Forest Area (as defined in Subdecree\n143; 2009) that were forested as of the project start date, with the exception of areas excluded\nbecause of issues relating to complex land tenure. The leakage belt encompasses adjacent areas of\nforest into which the project might risk displacing some deforestation activities. The leakage\nmanagement area where selected livelihood improvement activities will take place comprises the\nnon-forest, agricultural areas used by the participating villages. Together these three zones constitute\nthe project zone which must be defined under the CCB Standard.

Further east, the\narea climbs in elevation to the Sen Monorom plateau, forming the south-western extremity of the\nAnnamite mountain range, one of Asia's great centres of endemism.\nSoils\nSoils are of moderate to high potential fertility on the younger rocks associated with the plateau, while\nthe lowlands are mostly of low to moderate fertility except for pockets of alluvial soil (SCW 2006).\nHydrology\nTwo medium-sized tributaries of the Mekong drain most of the area whilst the southernmost valleys\ndrain into the Dong Nai river system in Vietnam. Many of the rivers cease to flow during the prolonged\ndry season. The plains are characterised by hundreds of small seasonal grassy wetlands and pools\n('trapeangs' in Khmer) dotted across the forest.\nClimate\nThe climate is tropical monsoonal: the dry season from November to April with north easterly winds\nand the wet season from May to October with south-westerly winds (SCW 2006). Total annual rainfall\nis 2200-2800 mm at the SPF headquarters, higher on the plateau and probably lower in the plains 2.\n2 Combined results from WCS\/FA and Nomad RSI (unpublished).\n3\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION\nVCS Version 3, CCB Standards Second Edition\nOver 85% of rain at the headquarters falls during May-October; December-April typically record less\nthan 100 mm of rain per month and hence there are typically 5 'dry' months."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_state_province': 'Mondulkiri', 'project_country': 'Cambodia'}"}]}

Social well-being\n2. Economic well-being\n3. Environmental well-being\n4. Technological well-being\n1. Social well-being:\nThe main source for electricity generation for this power plant will be locally available agriculture\nwaste\/ woody biomass. The economy of the local people will be improved by selling biomass to\nthe power plant. Since the project is located in a village it will assist in alleviation of poverty to\ncertain extent by generating both direct and indirect employment in the area of skilled\/unskilled\njobs for regular operation and maintenance of the power plant.\n2\nMinistry of Environment and Forest web site: http:\/\/envfor.nic.in:80\/divisions\/ccd\/cdm_iac.html\nv3.2 10\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n2. Economic well-being:\nThe biomass gasification process is an alternative to fossil fuel based power plants and the\ndecentralized power generation through biomass gasification will reduce the transmission and\ndistribution losses. The project shall create new rural income resulting from the sales of biomass\nfuel like agriculture waste\/ woody biomass. Increased income levels shall contribute to the\neconomic safety and empowerment of the most vulnerable sections of local society.\n3. Environmental well-being:\nThe project is using biomass for power generation. There is no net GHG emission from this\nproject activity. Combustion of biomass in the proposed project does not result in net increase in\nGHG emissions of CO . In the absence of the project activity the biomass would have been 2\ndecayed in the land and would emit CH . Hence, the project activity is also reducing CH 4 4\nemission in the atmosphere.\nThus, the project causes no negative impact on the surrounding environment contributing to\nenvironmental well-being.\n4. Technological well-being:\nThe project makes use of efficient environmentally safe biomass gasification technology for\npower generation with no Green House Gas (GHG) emission. The recent development in the gas\ncooling and cleaning system provides dry producer gas with the tar and particulate level at an\nacceptable range.\nThe generation of electricity from the project leads to strengthening of the grid, increasing the\nenergy availability thereby meeting the energy demand to a certain extent leading to\ntechnological well-being.\nIn view of the above, the PP has considered that the project activity profoundly contributes to the\nsustainable development.\n2 APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY\n2.1 Title and Reference of Methodology\nTitle: Type-I, Renewable Energy Project\nMethodology: AMS I.D.

Summary Description of the Project (G1.2)\nAllcot Blue Carbon Mangrove Restoration project in Senegal (ABC Mangrove Senegal) is a grouped project\nfor the reforestation and conservation of mangrove ecosystems in Senegal. Through the restoration of at\nleast 7,000 ha of mangroves, the project aims to:\no Strengthen the vegetation cover in the mangrove ecosystems.\no Improve the production and income of vulnerable groups.\no Strengthen the capacity of vulnerable groups to use land resources sustainably.\nThe restoration of the ecosystem currently degraded will aim to use this ecosystem to adapt the coast line\nof Senegal to the climate change. The structural diversity of mangrove roots and their position at the\ninterface between land and sea gives mangroves an important role as habitats for numerous species and\nhave also been found to act as a refuge for corals from ocean acidification.\nIn addition, mangroves provide a number of important benefits for surrounding habitats contributing to water\nquality and nutrient transfer. Mangroves filter and trap sediment from run-off and river water before it\nreaches adjacent ecosystems, reducing the turbidity of the water and allowing essential light to reach\necosystems. Mangroves therefore contribute to the survival of these adjacent ecosystems and the species\nthey support. Because of the importance of this ecosystem, the main objective of the grouped project is to\nprotect and restore the mangrove fighting against big threats.\nInvolving the local communities since the beginning is one of the most important steps in the project. This\nincludes providing information on all project activities and teaching basic concepts on climate change, and\ncarbon sequestration projects. The project promotes a functioning family model where both women and\nmen can equally participate in the project. People will show alternative livelihood opportunities that allow\nthem to acquire and grow high-value crops, beekeeping, or ecotourism among other potential possibilities,\nwhich also reduces pressure on mangrove forests. An improvement of the basic infrastructure for rural\ncommunities is targeted as well.\nThe\n(Fatick\nThe\nper\ncarbon\nThe at\nleast\nTable 1.

The Project leads to reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because it\ndisplaces electricity from fossil fuel based electricity generation plants.\nBundled wind power project of 24.8 MW (\u201cProject\u201d) has been installed in the state of Tamil Nadu.\nThe Project leads to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions because it displaces electricity from\nfossil fuel based electricity generation plants. The Project harnesses renewable resources in the\nregion, and thereby displacing non-renewable natural resources thereby ultimately leading to\nsustainable economic and environmental development. Wind World (India) Limited (WWIL) is the\nequipment supplier and the operations and maintenance contractor for the Project.\nThis bundled wind power project was registered with VCSA having capacity of 36 MW which\nconsists of six investors. Initially the project was designed to install a total of 45 nos. of WEGs of\n800 kW each. However, the subproject of Bannari Amman Spinning Mills was registered as CDM\nproject on 17-06-2011 (http:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/Projects\/DB\/SIRIM1306929016.84\/view). Hence, this\nsubproject has not been monitored in this project activity. Thus project capacity has been\nreduced from 36 MW to 24.8 MW after omission of Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) belonging\nto the investor Bannari Amman Spinning Mills. Presently, the project activity consists of the 31\nnumber of E-48 machines of Wind World make of 800 kW each to the total capacity of 24.8 MW.\nv3.3 3\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nThe first machine under the project activity was commissioned on 26-02-2007 and the last\nmachine under the project activity was commissioned on 11-05-2007. The expected operational\nlifetime of the project is for 20 years.\nWind World (India) Ltd (\u201cWWIL\u201d) is the equipment supplier and the operations and maintenance\ncontractor for the Project (earlier the name was Enercon (India) Ltd)1.\nThe project activity is located in the Indian grid which is dominated by fossil fuel fired thermal\npower stations. The grid is also doomed by power deficit and hence the addition of renewable\nwind energy generation will help in the sustaining and catering to the power demand.\nThe Project is wind based renewable energy source, zero emission power project connected to\nthe Tamil Nadu state grid, which forms part of the Indian regional electricity grid. The Project will\ndisplace fossil fuel based electricity generation that would have otherwise been provided by the\noperation and expansion of the fossil fuel based power plants in Indian regional electricity grid."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_state_province': 'Tamil Nadu', 'project_country': 'India'}"}]}

The project\narea is categorized into two groups. The first group of grassland will undergo sustainable grassland\nmanagement practices, which include implementing rotational grazing in different pastoral areas.\nThis approach involves limiting the duration and number of grazing activities in the project area to\nprotect the natural resources of the grassland and prevent further deterioration of the ecological\nenvironment. In contrast, the second group of grassland will experience a prohibition on grazing\nduring the first five years of the project. After this initial period, sustainable grassland management\nmethods will be applied. These methods involve reducing grazing time by dividing the grasslands\ninto seasonal grazing areas, determined by the carrying capacity of the grassland and the\nconstruction of fences. Specific guidelines, such as designated grazing orders, grazing cycles, and\nzoning for grazing time, will be followed to ensure that the grassland is grazed systematically, area\nby area, in a rotational manner.\nIn addition to the main restoration measures, the project incorporates various grassland\nmanagement measures aimed at mitigating soil desertification, restoring grassland vegetation,\nenhancing soil carbon storage, and promoting local biodiversity. These additional measures include\ninitiatives such as rodent and pest control, as well as grassland fire prevention. By implementing\nthese additional measures, the project aims to ensure the long-term sustainable management of\nthe project area, mitigate soil desertification, restore grassland vegetation, and ultimately contribute\nto the improvement of soil carbon storage and the preservation of local biodiversity.\nAccording to the baseline survey, before the implementation of the project, the grassland in the\nproject area was facing serious degradation and even desertification due to the impact of climate\nchange and human activities.

The specific benefits of the project\nactivity are as follows:\nContribution of project to Economic well being:\n- The investment in the project will have a positive\neffect on the infrastructure of the region, by\nbringing about improvements in infrastructure of the\nregion where the project activity is being\nimplemented. For instance, the communications and\nroad network needed by the project activity resulted\nin significant improvements in the communications\nand road network in the region. Similarly, with the\npower from the project needing evacuation to the\ngrid, the grid connectivity in the region was\nimproved as a direct result of the project activity.\n- The project activity would lead to employment\ngeneration during the time of construction and\nsubsequently during operation.\nContribution of the project to Environmental well being\n- The generation of electricity through renewable\nsources, such as wind in the case of the said\nproject activity, contributes to the conservation of\n9\n\nVCS Project Description Template\nfinite resources. As fossil fuels are available in\nlimited amounts, the generation of electricity from\nalternative sources helps conserve them. This\nreduction in consumption of fossil fuel resources\nalso contributes to improving the energy security of\nthe host country, which is rapidly developing and\nhas an increasing demand for energy.\nContribution of the project to Technological well being\n- The project activity involves installation of wind\nturbines with a large rotor and a more powerful\ngenerator enabling them to reach higher generation\nlevels. These turbines have been tailor-made to suit\nthe Indian conditions and have been designed\nspecifically for low and medium wind regimes. Thus\nthe project activity would also result in\ntechnological up-gradation.\nContribution of the project to Social well being\n- Power generation from the project activity would be\nsupplied to the NEWNE grid which is reeling under\nsevere power deficit. This would result in improved\ngrid condition and thereby the economy of the\nregion."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

The A\/R CDM project activity is implemented on degraded lands, which are expected to remain\ndegraded or to continue to degrade in the absence of the project, hence the land cannot be\nexpected to revert to a non-degraded state without human intervention.\nAs demonstrated by the supporting document titled, \u201cSec 2.5 Additionality,\u201d the area in\nwhich the project will be implemented has been historically used for grazing, and has\nbecome degraded to the extent that it is now minimally useful for grazing livestock. Were\nit not for the project and carbon financing, inefficient grazing would continue at low\nproductivity, and additional degradation of the project area would take place due to\ncontinued presence of livestock on the property.\nThe latest version of the \u201cTool for the identification of degraded or degrading lands for\nconsideration in implementing A\/R CDM project activities\u201d was applied to demonstrate\nthat the project area lands are degraded and degrading. See supporting document titled\n\u201cSec 2.2 Degradation\u201c, for evidence of the use of this tool.\n2. If at least a part of the project activity is implemented on organic soils, drainage of these soils is\nnot allowed and not more than 10% of their area may be disturbed as result of soil preparation for\nplanting.\nNeither the initial project activity instance, nor its future project activity instances will take\nplace on organic soils.\n3. The land does not fall into wetland category.\nNeither the initial project activity instance, nor its future project activity instances will take\nplace on wetlands.\nDue to the fact that the project scenario will not account for soil organic carbon as a carbon pool\n(see page 1 of the supporting document titled \u201cSec 3 Baseline Procedure Document\u201d. The\nmethodology states that the project is exempt from the additional applicability conditions.\n2.3 Project Boundary\nThe initial project activity instance is comprised of 20 individual reforestation lots, VC_1 \u2013 VC_20,\ntotalling 136.65 Ha.

The farmers plant trees\non their land and retain ownership of the trees and their products. They receive training from TIST and a\nshare of the carbon revenues from CAAC. TIST empowers Small Groups of 6-to-12 subsistence farmers\nin India, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania to combat the devastating effects of deforestation, poverty and\ndrought. Combining sustainable development with carbon sequestration, TIST already supports the\nreforestation and biodiversity efforts of over 199,000 subsistence farmers. The maturing trees and\nConservation Farming will provide additional sustainable benefits that far exceed the carbon payments.\nTIST provides an administrative backbone that supplies training in building nurseries, tree planting,\nConservation Farming, building fuel-efficient stoves and malaria and HIV\/AIDS prevention. Part of the\nbackbone is a two-way communications network that includes newsletters, weekly meetings at the Small\nGroup level, monthly meetings where groups of Small Groups receive training, periodic seminars at the\nnational level and an award-winning monitoring system based on cell phones and GPS. Planting trees on\nprivately owned farms in conjunction with agricultural activities is minimally disruptive, resulting in virtually\nno leakage or baseline emissions.\nPrior to project implementation, the project areas were being used as grassland or cropland. The baseline\nscenario is a continuation of these farming practices but without the introduction of tree species or the\nassociated community, climate, and biodiversity benefits. Participants are largely subsistence farmers.\nThe program\u2019s climate objectives include but are not limited to an increase in hectares and count of\nindigenous trees, total trees planted, and hectares of planting on hillsides and riparian areas.\nThe program\u2019s community objectives include but are not limited to the incorporation of Small Group\nparticipants within PD; an increase in number of Small Groups within PD, number of TIST participants\nwithin PD, participation in TIST Tanzania, number of person-training sessions on natural resource\nmanagement practices, health, HIV, tree planting, biodiversity, vocational skills, and ICT. As well as an\nincrease in number of community members with greenhouse gas agreements with TIST payments to\ncommunity for ecosystem services, number of live trees planted by TIST Small Groups, number of fruit or\nnut trees in TIST Tanzania, number of people employed by TIST or under contract to deliver services,\neconomic benefits for farmers, number of people accessing mobile money services, number of people\ngaining access to healthcare, hectares of riparian and hillside planting. The program will further seek to\nmonitor eucalyptus trees and ensure equal participation of women in leadership positions.\nThe project\u2019s biodiversity objectives include, but are not limited to, increasing the numbers of trees,\nindigenous trees, and Endangered\/Vulnerable\/Threatened trees, as well as planting on steep hillsides,\nriparian areas, and around HCVs.\nThe TIST Tanzania program began in 1999 and is today a subsistence farmer education program leading\nto tree planting, agroforestry and conservation farming project developed by Clean Air Action Corporation\n(\u201cCAAC\u201d) and operated by subsidiary, UMET.\nCAAC is the Project Proponent for sixteen TIST carbon sequestration afforestation projects in Uganda,\nKenya and India registered with VERRA and currently engages 204,799 farmers with over 24.8 million\nliving trees having sequestered over 7 million tonnes of CO2e as of 10 December, 2023.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 8\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nCAAC operates the first afforestation\/reforestation (A\/R) project in the world to achieve VERRA Triple\nGold Climate, Community and Biodiversity status. CAAC operates a benefit sharing agreement with its\nSmall Groups under a GHG Contract where it pays its farmers 70% of net profits generated by the carbon\nsequestered in their trees. Farmers are paid annually.\nCAAC aims to offer its VERRA A\/R carbon trading program and benefit sharing arrangements to the\nexisting TIST Tanzania farmers using its experience gathered over twenty three years of conducting\neducational meetings and teaching Best Practices.\nTIST Tanzania currently operates in Mpwapwa and Kongwa districts in Dodoma and Gairo districts in\nMorogoro, TIST Tanzania is also supporting farmers in Kibondo and Kakonko districts in Kigoma having\nformed 791 small groups, encompassing over 4,814 subsistence farmers in 149 villages who have\nplanted over 822,208 trees as of 10 December, 2023.\nTIST Tanzania has 15 full time employees. TIST Tanzania provide training to Small Groups in multiple\ndisciplines including tree planting, nursery establishment, climate change adaptation strategies,\norganizational management, conservation farming, clean cookstove construction and health education.\nGender equality is very important.\nTIST Tanzania\u2019s activities contribute to all 17 SDGs and align with Tanzania\u2019s national climate and\nenvironmental priorities. By 2034 the objective is to enroll 2,820 Small Groups with 1.1 million planted\ntrees with over 2 million tonnes of CO2e sequestered."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_country': 'Tanzania'}"}]}

The carbon intensity of the fossil-fuel dominated generation mix of\nthe grid is evident from the following break-up of various types of energy sources\nconstituting the grid-mix contributing electricity to the Southern Grid system.\nTable 2.1: Power Generation mix of Indian National Grid\nSource : Central Electricity authority11 as on 31\/01\/2009\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n9 http:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/methodologies\/SSCmethodologies\/approved.html\n10 http:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/Reference\/COPMOP\/08a01.pdf#page=52\n11 http:\/\/www.cea.nic.in\/power_sec_reports\/Executive_Summary\/2009_01\/27-33.pdf\n15\n\nVCS Project Description\n2. \u201cIf the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a\nwind\/diesel unit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small-scale CDM project activity\napplies only to the renewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel, the\ncapacity of the entire unit shall not exceed the limit of 15MW\u201d.\nThe project activity involves only wind power generation. The gross wind power\ngeneration capacity of the bundled project activity is 7.03 MW (1.1 MW, 0.6 MW, 1.6\nMW, 1 MW, 0.23 MW and 2.5 MW proponent wise), which is less than 15 MW as\nstipulated in the applicability criterion under consideration.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n3. \u201cCombined heat and power (co-generation) systems are not eligible under this\ncategory\u201d\nThe project activity involves generation of electricity only through WTGs and is not a co-\ngeneration system.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n4. \u201cIn the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy\ngeneration units at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added capacity\nof the units added by the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be physically\ndistinct from the existing units.\u201d\nThe project activity does not involve the addition of renewable energy generation units\nat an existing renewable power generation facility.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n5. \u201cProject activities that seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for renewable\nenergy generation are included in this category. To qualify as a small scale project, the\ntotal output of the modified or retrofitted unit shall not exceed the limit of 15 MW\u201d\nThe renewable energy generating wind-farms employed by the project activity are\nnewly set up and do not involve retrofitting or modification of any existing facility for\nrenewable energy generation.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\nThus, the project activity fulfills all the applicability criteria of the simplified small scale\nmethodology AMS-I.D.\/ Version 1412."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

Aksai Kazakh\nAutonomous County is located in the west of Gansu Province14. The objective of the\nproject is to restore the degraded grassland ecosystem through the sustainable grassland\nmanagement practices, such as improving the rotation of grazing animals between\ngrassland areas (called as rotational grazing), limiting the grazing duration on degraded\npastures (called as rest grazing), and replanting with perennial grasses (called as\nreseeding grass), and using other appropriate management practices (like rodent and pest\ncontrol and grassland fire prevention), thereby increasing the accumulation of soil organic\ncarbon and realizing GHG removals.Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) report of the\nproject, before the implementation of the project, 168,000.83 ha of grassland within the\nproject area were moderately degraded due to overgrazing for the past decades,\n24,394.50 ha of grassland within the project area were severely degraded due to\novergrazing for the past decades.\nBesides these main restoration measures, the project also alleviates soil desertification and\nrestores grassland vegetation to improve soil carbon storage and local biodiversity through\nother grassland management measures, such as daily management measures like rodent\nand pest control and grassland fire prevention to ensure the long-term sustainable\nmanagementofthe projectarea.\nThe project is estimated to generate GHG emission reductions and removals of 17,483,157\ntCO e in 40 years, with an annual average of GHG emission reductions and removals 2\n437,079 tCO e. 2\nClimate: Restore the degraded grassland ecosystem, increase grassland coverage,\nincreasegrasslandcarbon sink function andreduceGHG emissions.\nCommunity: Improve the livelihood of local herders\/villagers, provide permanent and\ntemporary job opportunities for them, and increase their income. Provide technical skills and\ntraining in sustainable grassland management, increase interaction within the community\nandimprovethe well-being oflocalcommunities.\nBiodiversity: Providemore suitable habitatsfor wild animals andincreaselocalbiodiversity.\nThe project area is located in Aksai Kazakh Autonomous County of Jiuquan city of Gansu\nprovince of China.

The Cauaxi River, which\ngives the project its name, is one of the tributaries of the Capim River, located in the central portion of the\nproject's reference region, at Paragominas municipality.\nLocated in the north of Brazil, Par\u00e1 is one of the 27 Brazilian federative units and has an area of almost\n1,3 million square kilometers, making it the second largest Brazilian state. GPD is in Par\u00e1's southeast\nmesoregion in the microregion of Paragominas with a total reference region of 5,268,809 ha and is\napproximately 453 km from Bel\u00e9m, the state capital (Figure 1). As GPD is in the \u201cDeforestation Arc\u201d, the\nregion with historical highest rate of deforestation in the Amazon, its forests are under increased threat from\ndeforestation.\nFigure 1 \u2013 Cauaxi REDD+ Grouped Project- Spatial boundaries\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 8\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nIt is important to highlight that the actions involving the implementation of the REDD+ Cauaxi grouped\nproject are complementary to the grouped project for the BRAZILIAN AMAZON APD GROUPED PROJECT\n(ID 255111). Through these two projects, in accordance with current federal and state environmental laws,\nBRCarbon seeks to promote integral forest conservation actions in rural properties with remaining\nvegetation, promote solutions based on nature in its regions of influence, generating co-benefits not only\nfor the climate (reduction and removal of emissions), but also for communities and local biodiversity.\nThe GPD aims to create positive economic incentives for landowners to conserve rainforests in private\nareas that are vulnerable to degradation and deforestation, while contributing to net positive climate impacts\nas well as benefit to traditional communities and conserve biodiversity. According to Brazilian Vegetation\nLaw (national law 12.651), landowners are required to conserve 80% of the forest cover on properties\nlocated in the Legal Amazon. Since the law is not enforced in the Deforestation Arc, illegal logging and\ndeforestation in the protected areas inside of the farms are common. One important aspect is that the\nconservation and monitoring costs can be prohibitive for the landowner, especially in non-productive and\nbroad areas. The carbon project can therefore contribute to enforcing the law, providing landowners with\nan opportunity to monitor and conserve their lands, as well as engaging local communities in the project\nzone.\nBy joining BRCarbon (hereafter known as BRC) conservation program, forest owners can access\nfinancial funds from the carbon voluntary market to develop conservation and monitoring efforts in their\nforests. A partnership between BRC and landowners will result in the legal protection of forests, forest\nmonitoring using satellite images, biodiversity inventory (including fauna and flora species), and forest\nbiomass inventory in a broad scale, using an upscaling approach based on field collection, drone-borne\nand satellite sensors such as LiDAR (light detection and ranging). In addition, we will involve strength the\nsurveillance of property, wildfire monitoring, fire prevention and fighting, threatened and monitoring\nbiodiversity species and social activities with traditional communities in the project zone.\nBRC will be responsible for the development, implementation, monitoring, and certification of the\nproject instances. It is the landowners' responsibility to allow project activities to be implemented in their\nareas, as well as the voluntary commitment to their long-term conservation. As a result, BRC expects to\nenhance the climate impact of carbon projects, helping communities and biodiversity. This project is related\nto climate-positive impacts caused by the reduction of emissions caused by deforestation and avoided\ndegradation (REDD+). Two voluntary carbon standards are used to certify all projects: the VCS (verified\ncarbon standard) and the CCB (climate, community, and biodiversity).\nThis Project Description is related to twenty (20) project activities instances located in the Par\u00e1 state.\nThe project activity instances (PAIs) are split in seven municipalities: Dom Eliseu, Rondon do Par\u00e1,\nParagominas, Tom\u00e9-A\u00e7u, Ulian\u00f3polis, Goian\u00e9sia do Par\u00e1 and Ipixuna do Par\u00e1.

Justification of the choice of the methodology and why it is applicable to the project\nactivity:\nThe application of the baseline methodology AM0029 to the proposed project is justified for satisfying\nthe three conditions:\n(cid:151) Condition 1: The project activity is the construction and operation of a new nature gas fired grid-\nconnected electricity generation plant.\nThe project activity is a new nature gas fired grid-connected electricity generation plant and no other\nfuel except natural gas is consumed. The project activity is currently under construction and will be\ncommission completely in August of 2007.\n(cid:151) Condition 2: The geographical\/physical boundaries of the baseline grid can be clearly identified and\ninformation pertaining to the grid and estimated baseline emissions is publicly available.\nThe electricity generated by the proposed project will be sold to Zhejiang Power Grid, which is an\nintegrated part of the East China Power Grid. As demonstrated in B.6, the grid for baseline emissions\ncalculation is the East China Power Grid, whose geographical\/physical boundaries can be clearly\nidentified and the information pertaining to the East China Power Grid and estimated baseline\nemissions is publicly available3.\n(cid:151) Condition 3: Nature gas is sufficiently available in the region or country, e.g. future nature gas based\npower capacity additions, comparable in size to the project activity, are not constrained by the use of\nnature gas in the project activity.\nNatural gas is sufficiently available in Zhejiang Province. According to the Natural Gas Pipeline\nNetwork Planning of Zhejiang Province (Gui-497, September of 2005), the natural gas supply of\nZhejiang Province comes from three sources: natural gas transferred from west, East China Sea gas\nfield and imported LNG. The natural gas supply is as follows:\nTable B1 Natural Gas Supply in Zhejiang Province (unit: 108Nm3\/a)\n3 http:\/\/cdm.ccchina.gov.cn\/WebSite\/CDM\/UpFile\/2006\/2006121591135575.pdf\nThis template shall not be altered. It shall be completed without modifying\/adding headings or logo, format or font.\n\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM PDD) - Version 03.1.\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board\npage 8\nThe natural gas supply in Zhejiang Province is responsible and operated by Zhejiang Provincial\nNatural Gas Development Co., Ltd.4. According to the feasibility study report of the project, the\nexpected consumption of natural gas by the proposed project is 5.3354\u00d7108Nm3\/a, which is very\nsmall amount compared with the total natural gas available in Zhejiang Province. Furthermore,\naccording to the Natural Gas Pipeline Network Planning of Zhejiang Province, the natural supplying\nto industry user, natural gas power plant, natural gas thermal plant and civil use is ensured. Therefore\nthe natural gas which will be consumed by the proposed project would not displace the natural gas\nthat would otherwise be used elsewhere in an economy.\nTo summarize, the approved baseline methodology, AM0029: \u201cBaseline Methodology for Grid\nConnected Electricity Generation Plants using Natural Gas\u201d is applicable to the proposed project.\nThe approved monitoring methodology AM0029 \u201cGrid Connected Electricity Generation Plants using\nNon-Renewable and Less GHG Intensive Fuel\u201d is applicable for:\n(cid:151) The applicability of the associated baseline methodology is justified.

The climate objective is to avoid emissions from deforestation during the\nproject timeframe. The project area was slated for conversion to sugarcane agriculture.\nThe project consists of protection of the property through 2040 (30 years) through patrols. Gallon\nJug Agroindustry Ltd. (GJA) owned and managed the property prior to implementation of the\nproject. Gallon Jug Agroindustries implemented the project, and then sold the property to The\nForestland Group (TFG). Forest Carbon Offsets LLC (FCO) was an agent of GJA to develop the\ncarbon finance project, and continues to serve in that capacity for TFG. The Conservation\nManagement Institute at Virginia Tech (CMI) was the subcontractor originally hired to conduct\ntechnical analyses on behalf of FCO in 2011. A more recent update to the inventory data plus\nadditional community input data was developed by ERA\/Offsetters\/NatureBank of Vancouver,\nCanada. CMI updated remote sensing and mapping data in 2015.\nThis project started in 2011 to protect 8,432 ha of tropical forests in Belize, Central America. The\nentire property owned by GJA originally consisted of 53,882 ha. Near the center of the property,\n1,214 ha is managed as a cattle and coffee farm. An exceptional ecotourism lodge (Chan Chich\nLodge) is on the property as well. The property was selectively logged multiple times through the\n1960\u2019s when it was purchased (fee simple) in the 1980\u2019s by Sir Barry Bowen, a well-known\nbusinessman and former Belizean Senator. The property was managed for conservation with the\nexception of the farm. Due to the untimely death of the owner and the global economic recession,\na portion of the property was proposed for development and conversion to sugarcane for a new\nsugar\/electricity facility. Expected carbon finance allowed the owners to avoid going forward with\nthe sugarcane project, and instead sell a large portion of the property (~41,152 ha) including the\nentire project area, to The Forestland Group, LLC of Chapel Hill, NC.\nBiodiversity at Gallon Jug is well documented and world-renowned. The densest population of\nlarge cats in Central America has been documented on the property primarily due to superb habitat\nand a rigorous prohibition on hunting. In addition to large cats, there are notable populations of\nBaird\u2019s Tapir (Tapirus bairdii), Yucatan Black Howler Monkeys (Alouatta pigra), and Geoffroy\u2019s\nSpider Monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) all of which are listed as endangered by the International Union\nfor the Conservation of Nature. Many other rare species are commonly found at the project site and\n24 species are listed by IUCN above \u201cleast concern\u201d. The property has been identified as a key\nbiodiversity area (KBA) in Belize and Central America (Meerman 2007) and is contiguous with two\nother protected areas, the Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area, and the Maya\nBiosphere Reserve in Guatemala. The project proponents will support the community through\ncontributions to the Gallon Jug-Chan Chich High School Scholarship Fund, a scholarship fund to\ndefray the cost of high school tuition for children in the community.\nThe \u201cwithout project\u201d baseline scenario for this project is conversion to agricultural for sugarcane.\nAdditionality is proven by virtue of the financial statements of the former owner and written plans\nfor conversion. Road access is adequate. Topography is minimal. Soils are good as evidenced\nby the existing cattle operation already on the property and past efforts to evaluate sugarcane.\nImpacts to biodiversity and the local community would be drastic, largely negative and potentially\nimpact the surrounding properties.\nThe \u201cwith project\u201d scenario would maintain the current management regime which consists of very\nlow impact timber harvesting and conservation of the property. FSC certification will be achieved\nv3.0 5\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION\nVCS Version 3, CCB Standards Third Edition\nin 2016. The hunting prohibition will be maintained and patrols increased. Support for the\ncommunity will be maintained and increased by virtue of contributions to a scholarship program for\nmembers of the community to attend high school. Climate, biodiversity and community value\nmonitoring would commence.\nClimate, Community, and Biodiversity Standard Gold Level is achieved by virtue of the significant\nbiodiversity resources conserved on the property including habitat for multiple IUCN listed species\nand most notably IUCN-Endangered Baird\u2019s tapir (Tapirus bairdii), Yucatan black howler monkey\n(Alouatta pigra) and Geoffroy\u2019s spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi).\nForest Carbon Offsets LLC (FCO) is the project developer. The Forestland Group LLC is the project\nproponent. The Project follows the carbon accounting principles of conservatism, accuracy,\ncompleteness, transparency, consistency, and relevance.

According to the National standard documents of the\npeople's Republic of China and Project Design Report, moderately degraded areas refer to\nthe total grass yield decreased by 21%-50%compared with that before degradation and\nthe total grass yield decreased by 50% compared with that before degradation is regarded as\nseriously degraded grasslands.\nTotally, 91,034.80 ha of degraded grassland have been managed sustainably by reseeding of\nlocal high-quality forage.\nReseeding grass was implemented in degraded grasslands where grass seeds of local high-\nquality forage was sowed such as Spike basiline grass (Elymus nutans Griseb), annual\nmeadowgrass (Poa annua L), flat spike ice grass (Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn.), Achnatherum\nsplendens (Neotrinia splendens). After that, under the premise of not affecting the normal growth\nof the improved grassland, the grassland should be used reasonably and sustainably according\nto the local approved livestock carrying capacity. In this project, 91,034.80 ha of degraded\ngrassland12 have been managed sustainably by the implementation of reseeding grass.\nBesides these main restoration measures, the project also alleviates soil desertification and\nrestore grassland vegetation to improve soil carbon storage and local biodiversity through\ngrassland management measures, such as daily management measures from other protect\nprojects like rodent and pest control and grassland fire prevention to ensure the long-term\nsustainable management of the project area .\nThe project is estimated to generate GHG emission removals of 11,070,894 tCO in 40 years, 2e\nwith an average annual GHG emission removal of 276,772 tCO . 2e\nThe objectives of the project including:\nClimate: Restore the degraded grassland ecosystem, increase grassland coverage, increase\ngrassland carbon sink function and reduce GHG emissions.\n12 According to Distribution map of degraded grassland in Tianzhu County\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 5\n\nCCB + VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nCommunity: Improve the livelihood of local herders, provide permanent and temporary job\nopportunities for them, increase their income. Provide technical skills and training in sustainable\ngrassland management, increases interaction within the community and improve the well-being of\nlocal communities.\nBiodiversity: Provide more suitable habitats for wild animals and increase local biodiversity."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_state_province': 'Gansu', 'project_country': 'China'}"}]}

The project activity is replacing anthropogenic\nemissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in to the atmosphere.\n2. Mr. Mr. Jitender Modi asked - how can we contribute in mitigating climate change?\nMr. Chandra Prakash replied - one can efficiently use power by using energy efficient\nappliances and can use solar lanterns for lighting purposes.\n3. Mr. Jageer Shekh asked - can electricity generated from wind farm directly supplied\nto the local community?\nMr. Sunil Kumar replied - No, state regulatory commission does not permit to supply\nelectricity directly to users.\n4.

Kishore asked - what are other non-polluting sources of generating\nelectricity?\nMr. Chandra Prakash replied - biomass, solar power, geothermal power, and hydro.\n6. V. Ramesh asked - what are other measures to combat climate change?\nMr. Chandra Prakash replied - using efficient such as cogeneration combined cycle, super\ncritical boilers etc, renewable sources\/technologies for power generation. We can plant\nmore tree \/biofuel plant (such as jatropha), encourage industries to use energy\nefficient technologies. Transport sector, big GHG emitter, can be encouraged to use CNG,\nMass raid transport system, etc. Energy efficient domestic lighting, like CFL.\n7. Mr. R.

Wind turbines capture the wind's energy with three blades, which are\nmounted on a rotor, to generate electricity. The turbines sit high atop towers, taking advantage of the\nstronger and less turbulent wind. As the wind blows through the blades of the windmill, a pocket of low-\npressure air forms on the downwind side of the blade. The low-pressure air pocket then pulls the blade\ntowards it, causing the rotor to spin. The rotor turns the shaft that further spins the connected generator.\nThe spinning of this generator produces the required electricity.\nThe salient features of the technology employed in the two sites are:"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

The Conservancy is one of the last intact areas of forest within\nLusaka Province (named after the nearby capital city), and provides a 60-kilometer buffer to\nLower Zambezi National Park (NP), a strategic protected area in Zambia in a globally significant\ntrans-frontier conservation area. Lower Zambezi NP is adjacent to Mana Pools National Park in\nZimbabwe which is a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)\ndesignated World Heritage Site. The population of the Project Zone as of the 2012 baseline\nevaluation was approximately 8,933 people living in 28 villages spread within 4 community\nzones.\nThe Project Proponent is BioCarbon Partners, which is responsible for certifying the Project and\nfor early-stage Project finance.\nThe core project climate activities undertaken include forest carbon inventorying, modeling\ncumulative deforestation patterns, and soil carbon assessments. Core community project\nactivities include up to eighteen different types of community-based deforestation mitigation\ninitiatives designed to create sustainable, scalable alternatives to deforestation, and strategic,\nmeaningful incentives that comprise part of pay for performance programs that support forest\nconservation. Core biodiversity project activities include forest conservation systems, biodiversity\nmonitoring and management, and fire management. Project area boundaries were marked at\nproject start date and since then, aerial and ground patrols are conducted weekly to monitor\ncompliance. Every monitoring period, 20 % of accounting and proxy area biomass plots and 100\n% of leakage area monitoring plots are inventoried. Remote sensing imagery is used to monitor\ndisturbance and fires while wildlife and other biodiversity indicators are monitored in bi-annual\nfixed transects surveys as well as random ground patrols. Ongoing and new community benefit\nprojects are monitored by the Impact Monitoring division and their statuses are described in\nTable 2.\nThe project was developed to conform to the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standard\n(CCBS, Second Edition) and the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS, Version 3.3). It has been updated\nto conform with Verified Carbon Standard (VCS, Version 4.0). Furthermore, the Project is aligned\nwith the Government of the Republic of Zambia\u2019s (GRZ) National REDD+ Program, implemented\nthrough the Forestry Department.\n4\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\nThe project start and implementation date is 1 October 2009 and will be operational until 1\nOctober 2039.

The\nproposal was well received by farmers and it was approved by all project participants in the very\nnext months.\nSubsequently, each Entity socialized the project in each community through participatory\nmeetings. Farmers willing to voluntarily participate in the project were registered for these\npreliminary meetings. Each farmer concerned was then visited individually in order to assess\nhis\/her land suitability, conduct a biophysical assessment of the area, determine planting\npatterns and choice of bamboo species.\nSince the project has been conceived and proposed in a participatory way, and since it is\nmanaged by each Entity in a very cooperative way, any farmer may at any time give advice or\nrecommendations, being the full owner of the project through his Project Entity.\n68\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\nIn facts, farmers shall properly use a \u201cFarmer Journal\u201d (a register of farming activities) where\nhe\/she not only annotates all farming activities carries out each week, but also collects his\/her\nsuggestions and commentaries he\/she wants to share and\/or address with Gaia and the rest of\nproject entities.\nThe stakeholder meeting took place in stages from 10 May 2017, 21 June 2019, 30 June 2019,\n02 July 2019, 04 April 2020, 21 April 2020, 30 April 2020 in different parts of the Calabria and\nLombardy region.\nThe project proposer explained the process to stakeholders and community members regarding\nthe validation and verification of the VCS programme and the on-site visit of the\nvalidation\/verification body. The project proposer requested all the collaboration of VVB\nstakeholders during the validation process.\nSummary of comments received:\nThe project is generally well accepted:\n\u2022 Farmers are proud to be part of a climate change mitigation program\n\u2022 Farmers are grateful for this help or for reforesting their lands\n\u2022 Farmers are grateful for the additional and diversified incomes they canuse for their\nchildren's retirement or education.\n\u2022 Producers have also expressed their interest in the possibility of developing carbon\nsequestration projects. The project will help them to enter this new market.\n\u2022 In general terms, since they had not ever been involved in a bamboo cultivation, Farmers\ninputs and feedbacks has become more relevant and functional once the plantations\nstarted to be operational. As an example, a farmer in Montemilone plantation (approx. 20\nha.) wrote on the Farmer Journal that it was very beneficial to use a given fertilizer (multi-\nfeed 20.20.20) to strengthen bamboo roots during early growth periods. This suggestion\nwas firstly verified by Gaia and eventually shared with and promoted to all other farmers\ninvolved in the project.\nSome doubts or requests were taken into consideration:\nA. Will a truly efficient monitoring process be implemented? (Have heard of or known about other\nprojects led by other entities that did not includeor long-term follow-up)\nB. Will farmers receive training on agroforestry and forestry grassland?\nC. Farmers have requested the planting of other species\nIn the development of the project, all these questions were taken into account:\n69\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\n\u2022 A monitoring plan has been developed and the cooperative is strongly aware that long-term\nmonitoring is crucial for the development and permanence of the project.\n\u2022 Farmers will receive training courses as detailed in the farmers' training plan.\n\u2022 The choice was made in accordance with the choice of the farmers, the availability of the\nseedlings, the availability on the market of the bamboo wood.\nQ. How farmers will fight against pests?\nA. There is no universal solution to combat the pest. But the good practices of silvicultural\nprevention that will be taught to the farmer, allow to prevent the infestation of the parcels. The\nproject coordinator or forestry engineer responsible for training farmers will continue to seek\nsolutions and inform farmers.\n70\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\n71\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\n72\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\n73\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0"},{"role":"assistant","content":"[{'organization_name': 'GAIA s.r.l.

These\nboundaries include all the geographic areas and infrastructures within the National Interconnected Grid\n(SIN), as well as energy exports and imports outside the Mexican energy system.\nThe flow diagram for the project is shown:\nv3.1 6\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation\nThe project area is located in the rural region of Tehuantepec in Oaxaca, Mexico, where agriculture\nactivities are carried out mainly for sorghum sale. The land and the surroundings of the project area are\nnatural with a small surface water body passing through the eastern adjacent areas, which grows during\nrainy season. The nearest town of \u201cSanto Domingo Ingenio\u201d is located 3.7 km from the project\nboundaries. The project area covers an extension of 577 hectares, in which only 3.1% are to be used for\nconstruction. The land is owned and will remain under the ownership of the different parties for\nagricultural and livestock pasture uses. No significant environmental or socio-economic effects will be\ncaused upon completion of construction and throughout the operational life of the wind farm. The project\nis generating power to offset the combustion of thousands of tonnes of fossil fuels and, in doing so, will\nhelp preserve non-renewable resources by promoting the exploitation and use of renewable resources\nand technologies. Therefore, the proposed project activity is primarily implemented for power generation,\nand not with the purpose to create GHG emissions and their subsequent reduction, removal or\ndestruction.\n1.11 Compliance with Laws, Statutes and Other Regulatory Frameworks\nNot applicable since as per the last version of the VCS Standard (version 3.3) since the proposed project\nactivity is validated under the CDM.\n1.12 Ownership and Other Programs\n1.12.1 Right of Use\nOn March 8, 2010, CE Oaxaca Cuatro S. de R.L. de C.V. won the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de la Energ\u00eda\n(CFE) tender by the award of contract.

Therefore, the proposed\nproject activity is not saving the non-renewable biomass accounted by the\nother registered project activities.\nThe utilization of firewood from areas without any kind of management can\nnot be considered a renewable source of biomass, since it involves a\ndecrease of carbon pools and increases the carbon emissions to the\natmosphere, turning green house effect even worse.

Especially in the ceramic sector, the use of\nfirewood is visible non-renewable and unsustainable, involving negative\nenvironmental impacts associated21.\nAccording to historical data from Buenos Aires ceramic industry, the ceramic\nfacilities used to utilize non-renewable native wood from areas without any\nkind of management since 1988.\nThis way, it can be concluded that non-renewable biomass has been used since\n31st December 1989. Thus, the project activity is in agreement under the\nmethodology applicability requirements.\nThe biomasses utilized in the project, glycerin and native wood with\nsustainable management plan are common in the region generated.\nThe native wood with sustainable forest management plan and the Eucalyptus\nwood are considered renewable according to option I, as soon as they fit all\nthe assumptions below:\n\u201cThe biomass is originating from land areas that are forests where:\n(a) The land area remains a forest; and\n(b) Sustainable management practices are undertaken on these land areas to\nensure, in particular, that the level of carbon stocks on these land areas\ndoes not systematically decrease over time (carbon stocks may temporarily\ndecrease due to harvesting); and\n(c) Any national or regional forestry and nature conservation regulations\nare complied with.\u201d\nThe native wood with sustainable forest management plan fits all the three\noptions above since the area remains a forest due to sustainable management\npractices that are undertaken with.\nThe sustainable forest management plan can be organized into three stages:\nfirstly, the division of the property in exploitable areas and areas of\npermanent preservation that are inaccessible to exploitation. The second\nstage is the planning of roads that connect the area with the primary roads.\nIn the third stage, the allocated area is divided for exploration in blocks\nin order to sustain forest exploitation annually22.\nAfterwards, a technical responsible elaborates the next stages: forest\ninventory, estimation of growth, the best intervention techniques, fixes the\narrangement of exploration and the silvicultural treatment. An annual\ntechnical report of the sustainable forest management area is elaborated and\nit is necessary a yearly authorization of the environmental agency of the\nstate to keep the activities.\nIn addition, the sustainable forest management promotes the conservation of\nbiodiversity, conservation of soil and water regime, which are essential\npractises to combat the desertification. Moreover, there is an increment at\nthe opportunity of employment for the rural population due to the\nsustainable exploration of plants destined for fruits, apiculture,\nmedicinal, oil, ornamental and fiber production purposes23.\n20 National Energy Balance - Energy Consumption per Sector.

Moreover, the\nafforestation supplies the society demands and avoids the pressure on the\nremnants of natural forests26.\nIn addition, sustainable management practices of the afforestation in Brazil\n(as the techniques of preparation, fertilization, control of weeds, improved\nseeds, cloning and reform) were introduced and constantly improved in order\nto increase its productivity27.\nThe afforestation in Brazil is complied with the ABRAF28, which represents,\npromotes and defends the collective interests of the forestry companies that\nengage in sustainable development based on planted forests. The limits of\nthe area of environmental preservation and legal reserve as defined by\nlegislation will be respected.\nThe cashew tree pruning is considered renewable according to option II, as\nsoon as it fits all the following assumptions:\n\u201cThe biomass is woody biomass and originates from croplands and\/or\ngrasslands where:\n(a) The land area remains cropland and\/or grasslands or is reverted to\nforest; and\n(b) Sustainable management practices are undertaken on these land areas to\nensure in particular that the level of carbon stocks on these land areas\ndoes not systematically decrease over time (carbon stocks may temporarily\ndecrease due to harvesting); and\n(c) Any national or regional forestry, agriculture and nature conservation\nregulations are complied with.\u201d\nGlycerin, coconut fiber, wood residues, and sugar cane briquette are\nindustry residues coming from agro industrial activities. Thus, these\nbiomasses are considered renewable according to option V of methodology\ndefinition of renewable biomass:\n\u201cThe biomass is the non-fossil fraction of an industrial or municipal\nwaste\u201d.\n24 BRASIL.

Therefore, the proposed project activity is not saving the\nnon-renewable biomass accounted for by the other registered project\nactivities.\nThe utilization of firewood from area without any kind of management\ncan not be considered a renewable source of biomass, since it involves\na decrease of carbon pools and increases the carbon emissions to the\natmosphere. Moreover, the native wood provided from areas without a\nreforestation management plan does not fit any of the options of UNFCCC\ndefinition of renewable biomass in Annex 18, EB 23.\nFurthermore, firewood has been used for many decades as fuel in\nBrazil17.

Available at:\n13\n\nBarbosa Ceramic - VCS Project Description\nthis kind of non-renewable biomass began to be applied, there are many\ndocuments to prove that wood has been used for thermal energy\ngeneration before 1989 as requested in the applied methodology.\nFirewood used to be the most employed source of primary energy until de\ndecade of 1970, when the petroleum started to supply the majority of\nBrazilian\u2019s energy needs18. Moreover the Brazilian\u2019s Energy and Mine\nMinistry has been monitoring every energetic sectors of Brazil since\n1970, and firewood appears over the years monitored as a significant\nsource of thermal energy for ceramic sector19. Especially in the ceramic\nsector, the use of firewood is visible non-renewable and unsustainable,\ninvolving negative environmental impacts associated20.\nThis way, it can be concluded that non-renewable biomass has been used\nsince 31 December 1989.\nSawdust\/wood chips are forest residues while a\u00e7a\u00ed pits, Brazil-nut\nresidues and rice husk are agro-industries residues, so they are\nconsidered renewable according to option V of methodology definition of\nrenewable biomass: \u201cThe biomass is the non-fossil fraction of an\nindustrial or municipal waste\u201d. Besides, sawdust, a\u00e7a\u00ed pits, Brazil nut\nresidue and rice husk are common residues in the region generated.\nThe elephant grass is considered renewable according to option III, as\nsoon as it fit all the assumptions below:\n\u201cThe biomass is non-woody biomass and originates from croplands and\/or\ngrasslands where:\n(a) The land area remains cropland and\/or grasslands or is reverted to\nforest; and\n(b) Sustainable management practices are undertaken on these land areas\nto ensure in particular that the level of carbon stocks on these land\nareas does not systematically decrease over time (carbon stocks may\ntemporarily decrease due to harvesting); and\n(c) Any national or regional forestry, agriculture and nature\nconservation regulations are complied with.\u201d\nMoreover, the project activity will annually generate less than 45\nMWThermal."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

When farmers clear the forest for agriculture, stumps are always\nremoved if the cleared land is to be used for growing crops such as maize. This is because the land is\nusually tilled by ox-plough and stumps can present an impediment. Commiphora stumps rot away quite\nquickly after the tree has been cut down but the acacia are often too hard to be cut with an axe or panga,\nso the farmers fell them by making a fire around the base of the tree. This eventually topples the tree and\nthe fire smolders into the stump and burns it down to below the surface of the soil. Stumps are\ncorrespondingly not visible from the cleared farm.\nOur site management team and the majority shareholder of Rukinga Ranching Company Ltd, Mike\nKorchinsky, have been in the area for almost 15 years and have not seen a single stump in a maize farm.\nAs a result we contend that it is common practice in this region to burn the stumps out, and therefore we\nselect 100% as the Proportion of below ground biomass removed from large trees.\nSelecting the Proportion of Wood Products\nThere is no harvest of commercial timber from the project area in the Baseline, nor for wood carving,\nfurniture etc. The only potential harvest of wood products under the baseline would be for building\nmaterials for local village huts, e.g. the farmer might cut one or two trees for poles to build his home prior\nto slash and burn of the remaining biomass for cropland preparation. There are approximately 200-300\ntrees per hectare in the dryland forest, and a typical small farm or \u201cshamba\u201d is 5 acres or 2.5 hectares,\nrepresenting 500-750 trees, so the one or two poles taken for hut construction per farm represent a\ndeminimus amount of the above ground biomass of less than .5%. As not all farmers use locally\nharvested poles for hut construction, and even for those that do, the poles represent a tiny amount of\nbiomass as the huts are very small and grass thatched, we feel it is reasonable to ignore the\nsequestration of carbon in long lived wood products in the baseline scenario, and therefore suggest the\nproportion of baseline emissions that are stored in long-lived wood products can be zero.\n\u00a9 Wildlife Works Carbon, LLC 2010 48\n\nKasigau Corridor REDD Project Phase I \u2013 VCS PD Requirements\nFigure 13.

REDD has at times been\nconceived narrowly as simply a system of conditional performance-based payments (PES), (Sills\net al. (2009), The evolving landscape of REDD projects). Projects developed by Amazon\nReforestation Consortium & REDD group are similarly premised on performance-based payments,\nbut we have gone further in developing an approach to project implementation that recognizes the\npart that can be played by tried and tested interventions. These include participatory land use\nmapping, boundary determination, development of land use plans, clarification of tenure, income\ngenerating activities, employment and community development.\nThe ARC REDD+ Project that has a primary focus of preserving native forest in the Amazon in\nregions that is prone to deforestation. . Project is mainly focussed on conserving the native forest\nthrough protection and the avoiding further actors of deforestation. who are seeking to degrade,\nThe native forest conservation will be able to support and protect more flora and fauna. The project\npreserves 53,528 hectares of the native forest.\nThe project goal it to prove out the economic feasibility of preserving the forest in regions that are\nalready heavily degraded, and where it is still considered socially acceptable to convert forest to\nagriculture. Prior to the current owner the land was a degraded forest, with no cutting plan, the\nforest area still has a high threat situation, and it is common for illegal loggers to be operating in\nand around the project area.\nThe project is located in the eastern part of the Brazil in the state of Para, which is shared between\nthree municipalities of Paragominas, Ulianopolis and Nova Esperanca do Piria. This project area\ncovers 53,528 hectares of Amazon forests and is located 300 km from Belem, the capital of Para\nstate, Brazil. As depicted in Figure 1, this area is under increasing threat from deforestation.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 7\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nFigure 1. Deforestation in and around the project area. (source: Brazilian Amazon 2019. Data:\nUMD\/GLAD, NASA (MODIS)).\nThe Project will continue to protect the forest land, and help the forest area to regenerate from the\nprevious landowner who degraded all aspects of the 53,528 hectares. \u2022 It also creates job for\nlocal population, bi-annual training in reforestation practices, sustainable development, fire\nprevention, and the project helps the local population to have high capacities to move into the rural\nmiddle class through training in sustainable land use.\nHowever, these areas have been affected by livestock and agricultural activities, represented by\ndual-purpose cattle (milk and meat), cultivation of cassava and beans production. These activities\nare characterized by traditional, low-tech products and low value-added products. Based on\nprevailing historical land use trends in the region, agricultural and livestock uses are the scenarios\nidentified prior the implementation of the activities (baseline scenario). In this regard, the main\nproject objective is the reduction of illegal logging and the recovery of degraded forests through the\ndevelopment of REDD project.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 8\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nClimate Benefits:\nEstimated annual GHG reductions are 258,328 tons of CO2e per year, the project corresponds to\nan estimated 7,749,856 avoided deforestation over the life of the project.\nCommunity Benefits:\nThe main object of the project for the community is to direct the community towards employment\nopportunities in the area. In addition to this project has provided cook stoves for the local population\nand conducts bi-annual training on sustainable land use to conserve the native forest. There are 4\ndifferent villages next to the project area, where the project attempts to focus hiring from these\nvillages, where it saves the project money by not having to transport people from the two population\ncenters of Ulianopolis and Paragominas. Also to Improve livelihoods of Paragominas, to Promote\nsustainable tourism in designated zones of the reference region of the project and to Secure land\nrights to the locals living in and around the project area.\nBiodiversity Benefits:\nProject has created the concept of animal corridor by the constructing the bridges for Capuchin\nmonkey, which were very common in and around the project area but now to the increased rate of\ndeforestation which are under threat and have been listed under endangered species under IUCN.\nStrengthening governance in and around the project area by employing security guards for forest\nprotection. Main intention of creating bridges was to avoid road accidents for the monkeys. Since\nthe project area is surrounded by agricultural lands and other plains, death of monkeys were very\ncommon on the roads due to accidents. By creating the rope bridges for monkeys to cross the\nroads and to enter the project area, monkey deaths have been minimized."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_state_province': 'Para', 'project_country': 'Brazil'}"}]}

Although InfiniteEARTH had undertaken significant work and investments in\nthe project area prior to November 2008, it was from this point that a specific date can be identified where\nproject development was focused.\n\uf0b7 Crediting period start date: the date the first monitoring period commenced\nCrediting period start date: July, 2009\nProject area monitoring started January 2009 with focused field patrols, stratification of the project area\nand a series of G.I.S. and remote sensing analyses of project conditions. This was followed by field survey\ndesign, SOP development and field team training in May 2009 prior to field surveys for carbon stock\nassessments beginning June 24, 2009. July 1, 2009 starts the crediting period.\n\uf0b7 VCS project crediting period: A maximum of ten years that may be renewed at most two times.\nA 30\u2010year crediting period will be used for this project.\n14\n\nInfiniteEARTH\u2010Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve Project\nConditions prior to project initiation:\nClimate\n39B\nRainfall in the Carbon Accounting Area is approximately 2500 \u2013 2700 mm per year. Monthly rain\naccumulation varies year to year with dry season months typically lasting from June to October. The wet\nseason, typically occurring between October and May experiences two peaks in rainfall, one in November\nand one in February. Based on the Schmidt and Ferguson classification, the project Zone is classified as a\nwet to very wet tropical rainforest region. Periods of extended dryness are known to occur during El Ni\u00f1o\nyears, when the dry season may last from June to December or longer. There are no major climate\ndisturbances in the Carbon Accounting Area.\nHydrology\n40B\nThe majority of the Carbon Accounting Area falls within the Seruyan watershed draining to the Seruyan\nRiver, which forms the eastern border of the Project Zone. The Seruyan watershed itself covers\napproximately 13,144 km2 and is comprised of a complex network of rivers and associated swamps.\nP P\nOther minor watersheds in or near the Project Zone lie in the southern portion of the Project near the\ncoastline, with headwaters less than 10 km from the sea. Tributaries of the Seruyan River generally arise in\nthe western portion of the Project Zone and in Tanjung Puting National Park, and flow east\u2010south\u2010east to\nthe Seruyan which flows south to the Java Sea. The average width of the Seruyan River is 25\u2010110 meters\nwith a depth ranging from 7\u201023 meters. Smaller tributaries form an extensive dendritic network in project\narea swamps.\nDuring the rainy season, annual overflow of the Seruyan River floods the villages located on either side of\nthe river up to a distance of \u00b1 2 km from the river. In the dry season, the Seruyan drops significantly, with\nnumerous exposed sandbars and river water levels ca. 8\u201010 meters below river banks in many areas.\nGeology, Topography and Soils\n41B\nThe underlying geology of the Carbon Accounting Area is dominated by depositional substrates of recent\norigin compared to the rest of Kalimantan. Co\u2010dominant soil types derived from peat and riverine alluvium\nunderlie most of the Carbon Accounting Area. Coarser\u2010textured sediment\u2010derived soils are also found to the\nnorth and east of the reserve. Within the project area there are ten dominant soil types comprising five soil\nassociations (Table 1).\nThe Project Management Zone is situated in the low\u2010lying swamp complex characteristic of coastal Borneo.\nElevation ranges between 0 and 10 meters above sea level, and the entire study area is generally flat with\n0\u20108% slopes on dry ground and 0\u20103% slopes in wetlands and peat swamps. Eight land systems are found\nwithin the project zone with the Mendawai Land System (MDW) being dominant. The MDW system is a\nregional system of shallow peat swamps with a slope < 2% with peat as the primary material.\n15\n\n[['', 'Soil Types in the Carbon Accounting Zone', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, ''], ['Dominant Soils', None, 'General Description', None, None, '', 'Parent', '', '', 'Sub\u2010', '', 'Relief', None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Material', None, None, 'landform', None, None, None], ['Haplohemist, Sulfihemists', None, '', 'Moderately', '', 'Organic', None, None, 'Peat Dome', None, None, 'Flat', None], [None, None, None, 'decomposed peat', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'soils some of which', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'are sulphic', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['Endoaquepts, Sulfaquents', None, '', 'Saturated Inceptisols', '', 'Alluvium', None, None, 'Delta or\\nEstuary', None, None, 'Flat', None], [None, None, None, 'and Saturated Sulphic', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'Entisols', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['Endoaquepts, Dystrudepts', None, '', 'Saturated Inceptisols', '', 'Alluvium', None, None, '', 'Alluvial', '', 'Flat', None], [None, None, None, 'and Acidic Inceptisols', None, None, None, None, None, 'Flood Plane', None, None, None], ['Quartzipsam\u2010ments,\\nDurorthods', None, '', 'Quartzic Entisols and', '', 'Sediment', None, None, 'Terraces', None, None, 'Flat \u2010\\nRolling', None], [None, None, None, 'Spodosols with a', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'Cemented Hardpan', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['Haplorthods, Palehumults', None, '', 'Freedraining', '', 'Sediment', None, None, 'Terraces', None, None, 'Flat \u2010\\nRolling', None], [None, None, None, 'Spodosols and Humus', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'rich Ultisols', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]]\n[['Delta or'], ['Estuary']]\n[['Quartzipsam\u2010ments,'], ['Durorthods']]\n[['Flat \u2010'], ['Rolling']]\nInfiniteEARTH\u2010Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve Project\nTable 1.

The delta is\na vast complex of tidal river channels and creeks, low-lying islands, mangrove forests and inter-tidal areas.\nThe delta\u2019s mangrove forests are unique in being the largest area of arid climate mangroves in the world.\nA global ecoregion in WWF\u2019s The Global 200, the region holds great ecological significance, supporting\nunique animal and plant species. The Indus River is the main migration route of thousands of birds, which\ncross over the Himalayas.\nThe ARR\/RWE Project Area is of High Conservation Value (see Section 5.1.2). The project directly supports\nthe livelihoods of 60 villages around the perimeter of the Project Area. These communities represent ca.\n5,000 households and ca. 43,000 individuals. Over a number of decades, mangrove forests in the Indus\nDelta have experienced massive-scale deforestation and degradation due to a number of contributing\nfactors. These include their use by the local communities as a source of fuelwood, fodder and open range\ngrazing by livestock (see Section 2.1.5.1). The situation has been exacerbated by the reduced supply of\nfresh water and sediments into the delta area due to upstream activity (see Section 2.1.5.2).\nIn response to the threats to the delta, the Government of Sindh conceived the Delta Blue Carbon \u2013 Phase-\n1 (DBC-1), a public-private partnership through its Forest and Wildlife Department and Indus Delta Capital\nLtd, a climate and development focused private. The project was originally conceived as a REDD+ project\nactivity. This CCB&VCS Project Description proposes the ARR\/RWE project activity for validation\nseparately. The AUWD project is anticipated to be added at a later stage. To date (by end of year 2020),\nan area of some 75,000 hectares has been restored with mangrove plantations. A total area of 224,997 ha\nwill be planted during the project lifetime. All planting is done in partnership with local communities in the\nProject Zone. A ward and watch system is formalised through Mangrove Stewardship Agreements (MSAs)\nwith various community groups, from which they derive further income. The primary method for the\nidentification of stakeholders in DBC-1 was through participatory rural appraisals and comprehensive SBIA\nworkshops (Section 2.1.8).\nThe project\u2019s climate, community and biodiversity objectives include (see Section 2.1.11): upscaled\nmangrove reforestation, participatory planning and awareness raising, access to education, sustainable\nfisheries, access to safe drinking water and healthcare, improved protection and law enforcement,\ncommunity-based business development and access to microfinance, sustainable energy development,\n13 As defined in Section 1.2.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3\n15\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\ntraining and capacity building of Sindh Forest Department, promotion of various gender development and\nincome generating activities for women.\nThe project\u2019s climate benefits include the sequestration of and estimated 142,050,139 tCO2e over its\nlifetime of 60 years at an estimated average of 2,407,629 tCO2e annually (see Section 2.1.17)."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_state_province': 'Sindh', 'project_country': 'Pakistan'}"}]}

The generated electricity\nfrom the implemented machines will be supplied to the southern regional grid of\nIndia through the nearest grid sub station. The generated electricity that is supplied\nto the grid will then be wheeled to SRF\u2019s units for their technical textile business\n(plants).\nProject Activity\n2\n\nVCS Project Description\nThe project activity comprises of 6 no\u2019s of 1.5 MW, S82 type of WTGs of Suzlon make\nand 3 no\u2019s of 1.65 MW, V82 type of WTGs of Vestas make. The electricity generated\nfrom the Suzlon WTG\u2019s would be supplied to the Udayathoor site sub-station and the\nelectricity generated from the Vestas WTG\u2019s would be supplied to the Veeranam site\nsubstation, through local transmission lines duly metered and measured at the\nindividual dispatching transformers at each WTG.\nContribution to GHG emissions reduction\nThe project activity harnesses wind energy to generate and supply electricity to the\nsouthern regional electricity grid of India. The Project displaces fossil fuel based\nelectricity generation that would have otherwise been provided by the operation\nand expansion of the fossil fuel based power plants in southern region electricity\ngrid, thereby leading to reduction in emission of greenhouse gases associated with\nfossil fuel based electricity generation.\nThe project activity is a Greenfield project activity which does not produce\ngreenhouse gas emissions, and we hereby confirm that the project was not\nimplemented to create GHG emissions primarily for the purpose of its subsequent\nremoval or destruction."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

It meets all applicability conditions of methodology\nACM0002 (version 13.0.0) which is listed as follows:\n1) The project activity is the installation, capacity addition, retrofit or replacement of a power\nplant\/unit of one of the following types: hydro power plant\/unit (either with a run-of-river reservoir\nor an accumulation reservoir), wind power plant\/unit, geothermal power plant\/unit, solar power\nplant\/unit, wave power plant\/unit or tidal power plant\/unit;\nThe project activity is the installation of a new solar power plant.\n2) In the case of capacity additions, retrofits or replacements (except for capacity addition\nprojects for which the electricity generation of the existing power plant(s) or unit(s) is not affected):\nthe existing plant started commercial operation prior to the start of a minimum historical reference\nperiod of five years, used for the calculation of baseline emissions and defined in the baseline\nv3.2 7\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION: VCS Version 3\nemission section, and no capacity addition or retrofit of the plant has been undertaken between\nthe start of this minimum historical reference period and the implementation of the project activity;\nThe project doesn't belong to these types, so it doesn't need to consider this applicability\ncondition.\n3) In case of hydro power plants, At least one of the following conditions must apply:\nThe project activity is implemented in an existing single or multiple reservoirs, with no change in\nthe volume of any of the reservoirs; or\nThe project activity is implemented in an existing single or multiple reservoirs, where the volume\nof any of reservoirs is increased and the power density of each reservoir, as per the definitions\ngiven in the Project Emissions section, is greater than 4 W\/m2 after the implementation of the\nproject activity; or\nThe project activity results in new single or multiple reservoirs and the power density of each\nreservoir, as per the definitions given in the Project Emissions section, is greater than 4 W\/m2\nafter the implementation of the project activity.\nThe Project is not a hydro power plant, so it doesn't need to consider this applicability condition.\n4) In case of hydro power plants using multiple reservoirs where the power density of any of the\nreservoirs is lower than 4 W\/m2 after the implementation of the project activity all of the following\nconditions must apply:\n\u2022 The power density calculated for the entire project activity using equation 5 is greater than 4\nW\/m2;\n\u2022 All reservoirs and hydro power plants are located at the same river and were designed together\nto function as an integrated project1 that collectively constitutes the generation capacity of the\ncombined power plant;\n\u2022 The water flow between the multiple reservoirs is not used by any other hydropower unit which\nis not a part of the project activity;\n\u2022 The total installed capacity of the power units, which are driven using water from the reservoirs\nwith a power density lower than 4 W\/m2, is lower than 15 MW;\n\u2022 The total installed capacity of the power units, which are driven using water from reservoirs with\na power density lower than 4 W\/m2, is less than 10% of the total installed capacity of the project\nactivity from multiple reservoirs.\nThe Project is not a hydro power plant, so it doesn't need to consider this applicability condition.\n5) The methodology is not applicable to the following: Project activities that involve switching from\nfossil fuels to renewable energy sources at the site of the project activity, since in this case the\nbaseline may be the continued use of fossil fuels at the site; Biomass fired power plants; Hydro\nv3.2 8\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION: VCS Version 3\npower plants that result in new reservoirs or in the increase in existing reservoirs where the power\ndensity of the power plant is less than 4W\/m2.\nThe Project is a new grid-connected solar power plant, therefore: The Project doesn't involve\nswitching from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources at the site of the project activity; The\nProject isn't a biomass fired power plant; The Project isn't a hydro power plant. So it doesn't need\nto consider this applicability condition.\n6) In the case of retrofits, replacements, or capacity additions, this methodology is only applicable\nif the most plausible baseline scenario, as a result of the identification ofbaseline scenario, is the\ncontinuation of the current situation, i.e. to use the power generation equipment that was already\nin use prior to the implementation of the project activity and undertaking business as usual\nmaintenance.\nThe project doesn't belong to these types, so it doesn't need to consider this applicability\ncondition.\nThus the baseline and monitoring methodology ACM0002(version 13.0.0) are applicable to the\nproject."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_methodologies': ['ACM0002']}"}]}

This expected increase in carbon stocks (carbon stock enhancement) in other areas of\nTISS is part of the plan of activities of the PCFS and will be developed later (Phase 2 of the PCFS) for\nquantification and possible generation of credits from REDD, when the project proponents obtain a specific\nmethodology and agreements for its implementation.\nCommercially Sensitive Information\nTwo manuscripts for publishing in peer review journals are being prepared for the SimSurui Model Report\nand for the Surui Forest Carbon Inventory. Thus, these two documents should not be publicily available.\n30\n\nVCS Project Description Template\nWhen the manuscripts are published, the authors will comunicate the CCBS and VCS and make they\navailable.\nFurther Information\nAmong the most striking features of this project is the role of the Paiter Suru\u00ed people to search for partners\nand alternatives to create the activities for the construction of this project and implementation of REDD+.\nThe Paiter Surui people, led by Chief Almir Surui Narayamoga, joined forces since 2007 to reverse the loss\nof cultural identity and the strong trend of degradation and forest conversion to agricultural uses in the TISS.\nOne point to note is that this initiative is also to a great effort to unite these people toward obtaining financial\nand technical resources to achieve their goals.\nThe Paiter Suru\u00ed people themselves identified the process of deforestation and loss of their traditional culture\nand have sought alternatives to contain it. Thus, their 50-year plan for the territory is a demand prior to\nconception of PCFS, but which starting in 2009 began to incorporate the proposed use of REDD+ as part of\nits strategy. Through the PCFS, proponents predict obtaining financial resources for the transformation of\nexisting sources of income, through the adoption of sustainable productive activities.\n2 APPLICATION OF THE METHODOLOGY"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

The project is aimed to improve the\nrotation of grazing animals, limit the timing and number of grazing animals on degraded pastures, and\nrestore degraded land by replanting with grasses and ensuring appropriate management over the long-\nterm. The project proponent is Inner Mongolia Chengyao Grassland, Forestry and Animal Husbandry\nEcological Technology Co., Ltd (hereinafter referred to as the Project Proponent or PP). According to the\nbaseline survey, before the implementation of the project, the grassland in the region has experienced\nserious degradation and even desertification due to the impact of climate change and human activities.\nTotally, 354,435.75 ha of degraded grassland has been managed properly and there are three main\nrestoration measures namely rest grazing and rotational grazing implemented in moderate degraded area\nand the categorization is in line with Parameters for Degradation, Sandification and Salification of\nrangelands (GB19377-2003) 16 . Based on the grassland productivity and the grazing livestock's\nrequirements, the grazing area is divided into several zones. A grazing method is established, specifying\nthe grazing sequence, grazing intervals, and zone-specific grazing periods. This approach ensures the\nrational allocation and utilization of grassland resources, while simultaneously safeguarding and restoring\nthe functionality of the grassland ecosystem, enabling sustainable utilization of the grassland. In this sense,\n57,663.20 ha of degraded grassland has been managed sustainably by the implementation of rotational\ngrazing. Rest grazing is also implemented in moderately degraded areas and requires that grazing shall\nnot be carried out within certain durations when the grass is under rejuvenation period. ha of degraded\ngrassland have been managed via the implementation of rest grazing. Replanting the grassland was\nimplemented in seriously degraded grasslands the degree of degradation is categorized as per GB19377-\n2003. Totally 170,092.28 ha of degraded grassland have conducted replanting to improve grassland quality\nand productivity. Native grass species, for example, elymus alashanicus, were selected for replantation\nbased on the soil and climate conditions in the project area. After replanting, the project area needs to be\nfenced for years to prohibit grazing to better restore grassland vegetation. Besides, after-replantation\nmaintenance is needed. Then under the premise of not affecting the normal growth of the improved\ngrassland, the grassland should be used reasonably and sustainably according to the local approved\nlivestock carrying capacity. The project is estimated to generate GHG emission removals of 12,367,308\ntCO e in 40 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 309,183 tCO e. 2 2\n16 GB stands for Guobiao, Chinese for \u201cNational Standard\u201d.

The power\ngenerated from project activity is exported to APTRANSCO, a state owned\npower utility company involved in transmission and distribution of electricity\nin the state of Andhra Pradesh.\nThe project activity is located in Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh, where the\nmajor activity in the area is agriculture and biomass is abundantly available\nand surplus in the region. The main biomass fuels that are used in the\nproject activity are rice husk, Juliflora, sunflower stalks, cotton stalks and\nbagasse . The project activity collects biomass within a radius of 50 km from\nproject location. The biomass residues that are utilized in project, in the\nabsence of the project activity may be unutilized, left to decay or burnt in an\nuncontrolled manner causing environmental nuisance and unintended\nemission in to the atmosphere. Hence, the project activity supports climate\nchange mitigation by avoiding emissions from biomass decay and displacing\ncarbon intensive grid electricity.\nThe project activity has a boiler of 30 TPH biomass fired boiler, wherein steam\nis generated at 66 Kgs\/cm2 pressure and 495oC super heated temperature\nand is supplied to steam turbine generator set of 6 MW capacity for power\ngeneration. The project activity will generate power through sustainable\nmeans without causing any negative impact on the environment and exports\nthe generated electricity to the 33\/11 kV Viravur substation owned by\nAPTRANSCO, which is at a distance of 5 km\u2019s from the project site. The\n4\n\nproject activity supports climate change mitigation as it leads to emission\nreduction of 2,78132 tons of CO eq. over the crediting period of 10 years. 2\nContribution of Project Activity to Sustainable Development:\nGovernment of India has stipulated following indicators for sustainable\ndevelopment.\n1. Social well-being\n2. Economic well-being\n3. Environmental well-being\n4. Technological well-being\nSocial well being:\n\u2022 The plant site is an isolated rural area where unemployment, poverty and\nother economic backwardness are prevailing. The project would lead to\nthe development of the region.\n\u2022 During civil works, a lot of construction work took place, which\ngenerated employment for local people around the plant site.\n\u2022 Other than these, there are various kinds of mechanical work, which\ngenerated \/will generate employment opportunity on regular and\npermanent basis.\n\u2022 Since, the biomass resources are collected and transported to the plant\nsite from the fields, opportunities are generated for the rural people to\ncollect and transport biomass. This results in the enhanced employment\nof the people.\nEconomic well being:\n\u2022 The project activity generates employment in the local area.\n\u2022 The project creates a business opportunity for local stakeholders such as\nbankers, consultants, suppliers, manufacturers, and contractor\u2019s. The\nmain fuel resources for power generation are various types of surplus\nbiomass which are collected from the farmers and brought to the project\nsite. This generates additional revenue for the farmers on account of\nsupply of the biomass to the project. Otherwise these types of biomass\nwhich are proposed to be used in the project were under-utilized \/ burnt\nand had little or no commercial value.\n\u2022 In other words, the plant is imparting commercial value to agricultural\nresidues enabling the farmers to get better price out of their produce\naugmenting their income.\n\u2022 The above benefits due to project activity ensure that the project would\ncontribute to the social and economic well being in the region.\n5\n\n\u2022 Hence, the project contributes to the economic sustainability around the\nplant site, which is promotion of decentralization of economic power.\nEnvironmental well being:\n\u2022 A power plant based on renewable energy sources (biomass) as fuel, does\nnot affect the ecology, provided a few precautions are taken in the design\nof the plant. Project also reduces pollution in general. All the necessary\nmeasures have been taken in the plant\u2019s design for minimizing the\nimpact on the ecology of the environment.\n\u2022 The project ensures the resource sustainability, which has been used.\nThe fuel is a surplus residue of agricultural products and hence the\nproject is friendly for biodiversity.\nTechnological well being:\n\u2022 The technology selected for the project is a more energy efficient\ntechnology.\n\u2022 This ensures an optimum usage of fuel thereby leading to resource\nsustainability.\nIn view of the above, the project participant considers that the project\nactivity profoundly contributes to the sustainable development in the\nregion of the project activity."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

Most of the trees will be planted as seedlings grown\non site in nurseries.\nMost of the area is very steep, has no road access, and is fallowed for longer periods than it is\nfarmed. However, natural regeneration in the project area is prevented by a dense thicket of\nbracken fern, occasional cultivation, and occasional hot fires when the bracken burns. To facilitate\nreforestation, the project is signing 30-year leases with the small holder farmers and village councils\nthat own the project lands for a rate greater than the opportunity cost of not farming the area. The\nproject covers all the costs associated with tree nursery establishment and tree planting and\nemploys hundreds of local community members in the process. To ensure that the planted trees\nsurvive, the project is weeding around the planted seedlings 3 times a year for 3 years, clearing\nfire breaks around the planted areas, and employing firefighting teams.\nThe project is a 30-year project and will remove approximately 5,341,395 tCO2e over the project\nlifetime which will be stored in live trees and deadwood for an average removal of 178,047 tCO2e\nper year.\nOn the community side, the project\u2019s objective is to greatly improve the local economy in the\nparticipating villages through reliable payments for leased land, creating hundreds of well-paying\njobs, the provision of avocado seedlings and improved bean seed outside the planting area and\nfunding village development projects. In terms of climate adaptation, the project\u2019s objective is to\ncreate economic opportunities which will be much more reliable than slash and burn farming on\nsteep slopes and thus help communities adapt to uncertain climate conditions. These economic\nopportunities include those described under community objectives as well as leaving communities\nwith a forest with valuable timber stocks which they can harvest sustainably through low impact\nharvesting after the end of the project. With 30 years of funding secured by the project, many of\nthe expected economic opportunities are already secured.\nFor Biodiversity, the project\u2019s objective is to create a forest corridor that reconnects the Kilombero\nand Udzungwa Scarp Nature Reserves, which are part of the globally recognized Eastern Arc\nBiodiversity hotspot, and home to many rare and endemic species including an endangered\nmonkey and several other endangered vertebrate species. The project is including tree species\n(see section 5.2.5) in the planting mix that are important sources of food for threatened primates in\nneighbouring forests, so that they may use the corridor in the future. Additionally, the project zone\nincludes many small patches of forest which the project will pay communities to protect, and which\nwill eventually connect to the nature reserves via the planted corridor.

The project activity will lead to overall development of the region, and will\nimprove the socio-economic status of rural people residing nearby the\nmanufacturing unit. The use of biomass will provide an additional source of\nincome for the rural community. Rice husk handling will also generate\nemployment for the local people including both skilled as well as unskilled\nlabour.\n2. This will provide necessary impetus for industries to come up with more such\nprojects in the area and set up an example for other industrial units to come up\nwith more such green field projects.\n3. Since the project activity utilizes biomass as fuel, it will reduce the\ndependence on non renewable sources of energy such as coal, oil etc.\n4. The project activity is carbon neutral as the emissions generated and\nsequestered balance each other so the net emissions of the cyclic process are nil.\n5. The technology used in the project activity is indigenous and safe.\nThe detailed explanation of the above mentioned points is as under\nSocial well being\n13\n\nThe proposed project activity will lead to generation of employment and\ndevelopment in the local region. More prominently employment is generated\namongst the local contractors, laborers and others for biomass handling at the\nproject site. This is in addition to the employment generated as a result of the\noperations and commissioning of the unit. Thus the implementation of the\nproject activity is expected to contribute to the provision of basic amenities to\nthe local region, which is relatively backward and under-developed.\nEconomic well being\nThe proposed project activity will lead to economic development in the region at\nthe micro-level by facilitating alleviation of poverty amongst local people. At\nthe macro-level, the project activity aids to sustainable development by\nsubstitution of fossil fuels by renewable biomass. This reduces the country\u2019s\nreliance on fossil fuels, majority of which is imported and provides economic\nvalue to crop residues, which previously had no commercial value.\nEnvironmental well being\nThe project activity will result in GHG emission reduction by utilising biomass\nresidues as fuel and avoiding use of displacing fossil fuel. In addition to the\nreduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions the project implementation will\navoid the emission of other harmful gases (NOx and SOx) that arise from the\ncombustion of coal used in heat generation. The project will also lead to reduced\nash generation since the ash content in rice husk is lower than that of Indian\ncoal.\nTechnological well being\nThe proposed project activity under consideration uses greener technology,\nwhich promotes sustainable development. While the project showcases an\ninnovative way for energy utilization of biomass (rice husk) which are not\nnormally used for heat generation purposes. The emphasis on using renewable\nbiomass as the fuel firmly sets an example for implementing technological\nprocesses that help mitigate the green house gas emissions. The initiative is also\nin line with the global focus towards sustainable development."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

There are no wetlands in the project\narea. Uruguay Land categories can be checked in the following web site from the Environmental\nGovernment Entity https:\/\/www.ambiente.gub.uy\/visualizador\/index.php?vis=sig\n\u2022 Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10 per cent of\narea in each of the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project\nboundary:\n(i) Land containing organic soils;\n53\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\n(ii) Land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land use and management practices and receives inputs\nlisted in appendices 1 (Cropland in which soil disturbance is restricted) and 2 (Grassland in which soil\ndisturbance is restricted) to this methodology.\nSoil Disturbance\nThe disturbance to the soil attributable to the project activity covers plough strips of 0,8 m width every\n4 m to the effectively planted area, representing a small percentage of the total \u2018Qarlbo\u2019 project area.\nHaving said this, the soil types of the project cannot be categorized as (i) organic or (ii) grassland in\nwhich soil disturbance is restricted. According to 2006 IPCC Guidelines (Annex 3A.5, Chapter 3, Volume\n4), organic soils must have at least 12 percent organic carbon by weight (i.e., about 20 percent organic\nmatter). As it is described by Silva27, organic matter content in brunosoles soils (from Coneat Group 2)\nrange from 3.1 to 8.2%. In this soil type the organic matter content, and hence the organic carbon,\ndoes not reach the 20% of the organic soils. Given that, as above stated \u2018Qarlbo\u2019 project soils are\nclassified as Coneat Group 2, it is concluded that the soil types of the project are not organic.\n\u2018Qarlbo\u2019 project lands are characterized by grazing activity with regular usage capacity and without\ntechnological improvements, implanted pastures or crops. These grasslands do not receive intensive\nmanagement with added agricultural inputs such as fertilization, reseeding, etc. The soils are of\nreduced natural fertility and show signs of soil degradation. Hence, the Project is applicable to this\nmethodology.\nA project activity applying this methodology shall also comply with the applicability conditions of the\ntools contained within the methodology and applied by the project activity.\nThis standard establishes a set of specific requirements for afforestation and reforestation project\nactivities, among which stands out the eligibility of the land.\nIn order to demonstrate the land eligibility, the PP should follow the \u201cProcedures to Demonstrate the\nEligibility of Lands for Afforestation and Reforestation CDM Project Activities\u201d in which Project\nparticipants shall provide evidence that the land within the planned project boundary does not contain\nforest and that the activity is a reforestation or afforestation project activity The land eligibility is\ndemonstrated though the use of satellite imagery showing that vegetation on the land has been below\nthe forest threshold according to the definition of forest adopted by Uruguay. In this regard, the table\nbelow provides the details of the adopted definition.\n27 LA MATERIA ORGANICA DEL SUELO, Ing. Agr. Alfredo Silva\n54\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\nThe satellite images displayed below show that the land did not contain forest from 31 December 1985\nto 2022. The land was covered by natural pastures and some scattered trees planted for cattle shade\nnot qualifying as forest.\nFigure 11. Satellite images of project property (from Google Earth).\nFigure 12. Satellite images of project property (from Google Earth).\n55\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\nAccording to the baseline scenario the project pervious land use was grassland (management practices\nlisted in appendix 2 apply). The project will be implemented on degraded lands which are expected to\nremain in a degraded state in the absence of the project. Extensive grazing activity have made the soil\nlost the original vegetation and a fraction of the soil organic matter, an essential component\ndetermining land productivity, leading to constraints to productivity.\nThe change in vegetation due to grazing reduced the turnover of plant residues and, consequently the\norganic matter content of the soil, thus leading to a more degraded state of soils.\nThe project will be implemented on degraded lands which are expected to remain in a degraded state in\nthe absence of the project. Evidence is provided here showing that, due to extensive grazing activity\npracticed for more than 300 years, with frequent periods of overgrazing, lands have lost the original\nvegetation and a fraction of the soil organic matter, an essential component determining land\nproductivity, leading to constraints to productivity, particularly in those areas affected by severe erosion.\nIn addition, due to frequent periods of overgrazing causing the soil to become exposed to erosive\nprocesses (i.e., due to lack of vegetation cover) combined with dominating moderate slopes in the\nterrain, gully erosion processes have affected most of the lands within project boundaries.\nNative vegetation in the project region was originally composed mainly by tall grasses and shrubs. The\nturnover of plant residues maintained relatively high levels of organic matter in the soil. Introduction of\ncattle in the 17th century brought about a degradation of the vegetation, which became dominated by\ngrasses that were kept short by grazing, particularly after introduction of sheep a few decades later.\nThe sheep and cattle extensive grazing activity has prevailed, more or less unchanged, until present.\nDue to the extensive nature, the production system is vulnerable to climate extremes, the relatively\nfrequent droughts that occur in Uruguay (e.g., dry periods every summer, with extreme droughts every\n10 years or so) are associated to overgrazing.\nGrazing practices applied on all the lands included within project boundaries during long periods of\ntime have resulted in significant losses of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients from the\nsoil, and have also resulted in significant alterations to the vegetation cover and the biological diversity.\nThe change in vegetation due to grazing reduced the turnover of plant residues and, consequently the\norganic matter content of the soil, thus leading to a more degraded state of soils. Some recent studies\nsupport this statement. Pi\u00f1eiro et al (2006)28 (peer-review study) have found that 370 years of grazing\nhave caused, on average for 11 grassland sites in Argentina and Uruguay, decreases in soil organic\nnitrogen content (\u2212880 kg ha\u22121 or \u221219%), soil organic carbon content (\u221221,200 kg ha\u22121 or \u221222%) and\nnet primary productivity (\u22122,192 kg ha\u22121 or \u221224%). The conditions in which this study was conducted\nmatch those of all the sites included in the project activity.\n28 Pi\u00f1eiro, G., Paruelo, J.M. and Oesterheld, M. 2006. Potential long-term impacts of livestock introduction on carbon and nitrogen\ncycling in grasslands of Southern South America. Global Change Biology 12:1267\u20131284.\n56\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\nAnother peer-review study prepared by Altesor et al. (1998)29 arrived to similar conclusions. Five\nsample plots on grassland sites in North Uruguay were measured in 1935 and revisited in 1990. It was\nconcluded that continued grazing causes an increase in the number of weedy species and decreasing\nthe palatable forage species. This is an indicator of a presently and continuous degrading process. The\nfindings of this study are applicable to all sites included in the project activity.\nThe First Report of Uruguay to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification prepared by DINACEA\n(National Environmental Directorate) in 200030 governmental peer-review study) states in its Section"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

Available at:\nhttp:\/\/www.protectedplanet.net\/sites\/Cantanhez_Forest_National_Park and\nhttp:\/\/www.protectedplanet.net\/sites\/Rio_Cacheu_Mangroves_Natural_Park\nv3.2 22\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS\nVersion 3\nForestland is expected to be converted to non-forest land in the baseline case as will be\ndemonstrated in the Baseline Scenario section (2.4) of this VCS PD. The project activity will\navoid unplanned deforestation, an eligible VCS activity.\nLeakage Management\nFIAL is expected to be a strong leakage management tool capable of maintaining or\nincreasing local population livelihoods through the introduction of new technological practices\nand alternative activities. In the event of residual leakage, emissions will be captured through\nthe project\u2019s MRV system. Leakage management and the justification as to why Project\nProponent expects Leakage to be minor are described below:\nThe nature of deforestation is subsistence agriculture and hence not prone to much\ndisplacement (not much mobility). In both parks, subsistence agricultural activities are the main\ndrivers of deforestation. In Cacheu, the most representative ethnic groups are Manjacos,\nCobianas and Felupes. These two groups use agricultural practices with shifting cultivation\nand plantation of rice, collection of oil and other products from palm groves and conversion of\nforest into savannah-orchards. The main agricultural product is rice, and during the last\ndecades, plantation of fruit trees has increased (in particular cashew13). In Cantanhez, the\nlocal population consists of the Balanta, Nalu, Tandas, Djacancas and Fula ethnic groups. As\nin Cacheu, rice is the main agricultural product. In this area, the development of fruit\nplantations is also observed (particularly bananas).\nThe project design is targeted to neutralize the drivers in a way that avoids leakage. While\nthere is a risk that leakage could arise from the displacement of the subsistence agricultural\nactivities, it is anticipated that project funds, flowing via the FIAL micro-project financing\nmechanism, can provide the necessary means to improve agricultural practices, create\nadditional income from fruit processing and other extractive activities, thus ensuring that the\ndeforestation activities will not be transferred to other areas.\nSo far, FIAL has demonstrated excellent performance. Micro-projects used simple, innovative\ntechnologies designed to increase incomes and improve social infrastructure while curbing\ndeforestation, improving drainage, conserving water and protecting water sources, preserving\nmangrove zones and building local ownership of the principles and practices supporting\nsustainable fisheries and coastal management. Not all investments had or were intended to\nhave direct conservation impacts, e.g., schools, but FIAL conveyed a strong message through\nproject-financed communications campaigns about the link between the environment and\nsustainable livelihoods, the meaning of conservation per se, and the need for organized,\ncommunity-based approaches. Improved educational opportunities and literacy were seen as\nlonger-term investments in sustainability. Priority was given to activities that also help reduce\npoverty and empower poorer communities.\nDuring its implementation stage, FIAL\u2019s goal was that at least 75% of the micro-projects\nfunded would satisfactorily achieve their objectives (based upon an independent evaluation).\n13 INEC (2007), during the 2007 census, 48% of the respondents listed cashew nuts as an agricultural\nproduct at the household.\nv3.2 23\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS\nVersion 3\nAccording to a series of evaluations14, FIAL\u2019s success rate reached 81,3% of the projects; a\ntotal disbursement of 1,47 million USD was made across 129 projects. An important example\nof institutional\/stakeholder collaboration for conservation and sustainable development ends\nwas the rapid and effective FIAL-financed pilot effort to restore seawater\u2013flooded lowland rice\npaddies threatening the subsistence and livelihoods of 3,000 people as well as the forested\nupland areas vulnerable to invasion and deforestation by these same groups if the paddies\nwere not reclaimed.\nThe project boundaries are drawn according to methodological requirements so it captures\nany displacement to the Leakage Belt. Although not expected to be significant, the project\nboundaries, more specifically the Project Area and Leakage Belt, have been designed to allow\ndetection of potential leakage, ensuring that any residual leakage is captured through the\nproject\u2019s MRV system.\nCommercially Sensitive Information\nNo commercially sensitive information has been provided.\nFurther Information\nNot applicable\n2 APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

The area is near mid-size cities (Portel) and is made\nup of disturbed terra-firme (non-flooded) with only small areas in v\u00e1rzea (seasonally flooded)\nforests. Although the area is far removed (80+ km north) from the Trans-Amazonian Highway\n(Rodovia Transamaz\u00f4nica, BR-230), river and sea access has facilitated extraction of most\nprecious woods, and most forest areas are heavily intervened; settlement by ribeirinhos (river-\nmargin dwellers) is also spreading westward from the Atlantic. There are also a few logging\nconcessions authorized by the Brazilian government operating in the area. Mining operations do\nnot seem to be a problem in the territories.\nMost riverside people (comunidades ribeirinhas extrativistas) subsist by a mix of fishing, hunting,\nand especially by harvesting a\u00e7a\u00ed palm fruits and by cultivating cassava from which flour is made,\nas the latter two are the main staple foods of the people in the state of Par\u00e1. Agriculture is practiced\nin small-scale slash-and-burn plots for the cassava; the a\u00e7a\u00ed palms, which thrive and naturally occur\nin seasonal floodplain areas near the river (v\u00e1rzea forest), are harvested from the wild and\nfostered\/planted near settlements and homesteads.\nThe Marajo REDD+ Project has a significant amount of forest and is home to several ecologically\nimportant flora and fauna in a strategic region of the Amazon where there is high deforestation risk\ncaused by illegal logging and expanding slash-and-burn agriculture. The project has implemented\nvia REDDA Projetos Ambientais Sociedade Unipesoal Ltda. (REDDA) a number of activities that\nseek to reduce forest degradation and deforestation in the project area. These activities include:\n\u2022 Patrolling.\nMembers of the local communities (comunidades ribeirinhas extrativistas) are being\nemployed by the project to perform regular patrol through the project area, with a focus on\nhigh-risk degradation\/deforestation areas. The patrol units cooperate with the local\nauthorities to prevent illegal encroachment in the project area. This activity deters the main\ndrivers of Avoided Unplanned Deforestation and Degradation (AUDD) such as illegal\ntimber extraction and slash-and-burn agriculture.\n\u2022 Alternative Sources of Income.\nIn order to reduce forest degradation, it is important that the riverside communities can\nreduce their dependency on unsustainable harvesting of forest resources. To achieve this,\nthe Marajo REDD+ project is already implementing and will continue to implement a\nnumber of activities that will provide the community members with alternative sources of\nincome. These activities include but are not limited to:\no Access to training and education:\nMany people within these communities have little to no access to proper schooling.\nThe project will build several schools throughout the project area, which will allow\nchildren to receive an education and increase their opportunities in the job market.\nThis as well as other training offers will also create a framework for learning about\nsustainable practices and forest conservation.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 8\n\n[[None, 'Brazilian-Amazonian oil-chemical company active in the segment'], ['of cold extraction of oils from Amazonian oilseeds.

An example of this is the creation of eco-jewellery, which in turn can\nbe sold to generate additional income. The project has facilitated workshops,\nmainly aimed at women, to increase their proficiency in these skills and in doing\nso broaden their opportunities of income generation.\no Strategic partnerships with local sustainable companies:\nIn cooperation with the local communities, the project has established partnerships\nto promote the sustainable use of non-timber forest products. These partnerships\nencourage income generation of hundreds of riverside families. Specifically, the\nfollowing two partnerships have been established up until now:\n(i) Amazon Forest People\nThe Marajo REDD+ Project has partnered with Amazon Forest People, a local\ncosmetics company. Under this partnership, oilseeds will be extracted by\nparticipating communities and sold to AFM to be used in their cosmetic products.\n(ii) Amazon Oil\nAdditionally, the Marajo REDD+ Project has established a partnership with\nAmazon segment\nof in\nthe\nBoth be\nresponsible\nsubsequently under\nthese More\nopportunities for future partnerships are being explored in cooperation with the\ncommunities.\n\u2022 Installation of biodigesters in local communities.\nTo meet the communities\u2019 thermal energy needs, mostly for the preparation of food, the\nuse of fuelwood and charcoal is still commonplace for the riverside communities. The\nextraction of fuelwood from the forest contributes to forest degradation. To mitigate this\ndriver of degradation, the project is deploying biodigesters in the riverside communities,\nallowing them to convert their organic waste into biogas. In addition to a reduction in\nfuelwood collection, this also creates a net health benefit: the combustion of fuelwood,\nespecially in enclosed spaces, can lead to a variety of respiratory and cardiovascular\ndiseases, besides combustion of (bio)gas creates much less pollution.\n\u2022 Installation of water filtration systems in local communities.\nBesides the preparation of food, fuelwood is often used to boil water, making it safe for\nconsumption. Water filtration systems have been installed in strategic places within the\nproject area. This will provide people with free access to clean water and further reduce\ndependence on fuelwood.\nThe main driver of deforestation within the project area is slash-and-burn agriculture. Subsistence-\nbased farming is expected to remain to some extent throughout the crediting period.\nBesides the activities described above, a number of activities have been implemented to improve\nthe health and well-being within the communities, such as periodical medical examinations, access\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 9\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nto dental care and other medical care as well as workshops on oral hygiene, and general hygiene\nand sanitation, especially for women.\nThe project estimates emission reductions of 266,034 tCO2e per annum and 10,641,360 tCO2e\nduring the project\u2019s lifetime for the REDD+ component.

In addition to\nclimate benefits, the Project also aims to generate social benefits based on sustainable economic\ndevelopment practices and improving the well-being of surrounding communities, in addition to\nenvironmental benefits through actions aimed at the conservation of local fauna and flora.\nThe Project Area has 135,342 ha of Amazon forest, located in the mesoregion of Maraj\u00f3, in the municipality\nof Portel, state of Par\u00e1, and is located on the banks of the Anapu and Tuer\u00e9 Rivers. Communities have\nbeen identified that are directly or indirectly influenced by the Project, and that are geographically close to\nthe Project Area and depend on its ecosystem services.\nThe region has great relevance in relation to its biodiversity, as it is located in the Xingu Endemism Center,\na place with a large concentration of rare and endemic species. The predominant vegetation is the Dense\nOmbrophilous Forest with a high density of medium and large trees, as well as woody and epiphytic lianas.\nIt houses at least 21 species of fauna and flora with some degree of threat according to the IUCN Red List,\nsome of which are endemic to the region.\nIt was identified that the main drivers of deforestation and forest degradation in the region are the advance\nof livestock in riverside areas, illegal logging, land grabbing (invasions and land conflicts), proximity to the\nBR-230 highway and the practice of slash-and-burn agriculture.\nFrom this context, the activities of the Project were designed to guarantee the conservation and protection\nof biodiversity and natural resources, through mitigating and preventive measures such as the improvement\nof the surveillance of the Farms, the monitoring of deforestation by satellite images, regional socioeconomic\ndevelopment through alternative practices to deforestation and the development and strengthening of value\nchains, the establishment of a biodiversity conservation program, promoting the in situ monitoring of fauna\nand flora in the Project Area, in addition to environmental education as a strategy to discourage predatory\nhunting and fishing. In addition to these actions, it is intended to strengthen local governance, mainly\nthrough stakeholder engagement and involvement.\nThus, the Tuer\u00e9 REDD+ Project hopes to improve the well-being of communities and generate exceptional\nbenefits for local biodiversity, in addition to the climate impact by reducing GHG emissions by 7,454,030\ntCO2eq in 10 years, equivalent to an average annual reduction of 745,403 tCO2eq."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_state_province': 'Par\u00e1'}"}]}

The field of native forest where the project is located has 22,878.5 hectares and immersed\nin the Green Corridor there is a sawmill operating. In this area, controlled logging has been carried out since\nthe 1960s and will decrease as the NIDEPORT project progresses, with harvesting expected to be\ncompleted by the end of 2021. The project activity is improved forest management with areas that will be\nenriched and regenerated by planting more than 250,000 native species individuals annually and others\nmanaged to increase forest productivity (bambuacea\u00b4s control, and others). The Forest Regeneration Plan\nstates the seedlings distribution which has been defined on the particular situation of the stratum and the\narea of the field to be treated, based on an in-depth study of different variables using various tools and in\ncollaboration with a professional team.\nAlthough there is not any community, individual or group of people living in the project area, GS1 has been\nsubjected to situations of intrusions and illegal occupations, with burning for planting or deforestation for\nrudimentary construction, there are numerous cases where the land has been colonized or exploited for\nagriculture or livestock, where the land is left with high levels of degradation and contamination. For these\nreasons project activities include enrichment and restoration. The area of the woody strata affected by\nenrichment activities (7,860 ha) will be actively intervened by the planting of an average density of 696\nseedlings per hectare (391ha), while in the remaining area the restoration will be through passive natural\nregeneration. On the other hand, in the most affected strata, the intervention will be in the total area through\nreforestation actions.\nBy conserving and sustainably managing almost 23,000ha of Atlantic Forest, the project proponent will\ncreate a cryptocurrency based on the natural capital of the forest with a primary focus on biodiversity and\na secondary focus on carbon. Each m2 of forest will be monitored, verified, and will have associated a\n11 In the absence of direct population or occupancy measures, measurement of reduced threats may be used as\nevidence of benefit\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 6\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\ncryptocurrency backed by blockchain and GIS systems. By installing monitoring towers with state-of-the-\nart cameras and the use of drones with photogrammetric cameras, the entire area will be monitored,\ncontrolling fires and illegal logging. This technology will help quantify the carbon removals and biodiversity\nincreases, information that will support cryptocurrencies.\nThe project zone, encompassed in an area with population under poverty line, expects to work together\nwith the community identifying risks, HCV areas and needs, in order to implement mitigation actions\ntogether. In this line, first meetings with communities have already helped to identify both biodiversity and\ncommunity\u00b4s HCVs, and possible projects regarding housing improvement, health care, among other needs\nto be identified during the project lifetime.\nThe \u00abclimate benefits\u00bb of the project are defined as the reductions or removals of GHG emissions resulting\nfrom forest regeneration, these are expected to reach 3,106,582 tCO2e during the crediting period,\naveraging 103,553 tCO2e per year. The \"community benefits\" of the project are defined as improvements\nin the well-being of communities resulting from the project activities in place.

Details on grid-connected power plants are given in the CEA CO2 baseline\ndatabase (Version 7), based on which the combined margin emission factor is determined.\nTechnology employed in project scenario:\nPower generation using wind is achieved by deploying 36 wind turbine generators (WTGs). Wind power\ngeneration is an environmentally safe and sound technology. The WTGs are supplied by Suzlon Energy\nLimited to the project participant. The components are manufactured in India and assembled at the project\nsite. There is no transfer of technology from outside the host country for this project activity.\nThe project uses Suzlon\u2019s wind energy technology and implements 36 number of WTGs of S95 model\nwith a capacity of 2100kW each.

In addition, the project activity is also providing needed\nemployment to the forest-fringed communities; supporting community-led natural resource\nmanagement and regeneration to promote reforestation; improving Nutrition, food security and\nlocal livelihoods through sustainable use of forests and trees and related income generation;\nThe project activity is managed by the Private Afforestation Developers Organisation (PADO), an\numbrella organization of private forest plantation developers in Ghana. They are the legal\nowners of the plantations located in Ghana; Kumasi at Kwamisa Forest Reserve located at\nOffinso Forest District within the Ashanti Region of Ghana. The reserve lies midway between\nKumasi-Techiman and the Kumasi\u2013Sunyani Road, about 35 miles north of Kumasi. The area is\napproximately bounded by the following coordinates: Latitudes between 7o 05' North and 7o 14'\nNorth Longitudes between 1o 50'West and 1o 57'West. PADO was incorporated in 2010 as per\nthe Companies code, 1963 (Act 179) as an association and out of it, PADO Investment Limited\nwas established and incorporated in 2016 as a subsidiary and a commercial business entity of\nPADO\nThe area was a degraded land before the project implementation caused by a severe fire\ndisaster in 1983 that engulfed Ghana and led to massive forest degradation and a severe\nhunger crisis. The government of Ghana formed a private investment strategy in 1999, where\nthe private investors signed a 50-year lease agreement to stimulate large-scale afforestation as\nit was a huge task for the government, and there was a lot of illegal logging, which further\nworsened the situation. PADO has over 18 years of experience in restoring degraded forest\nlands and has planted close to 7,000 hectares with trees with the engagement of the local\ncommunities\nThe ARR activities are carried out and monitored according to the approved project\nmethodology AR-ACM0003 for a project period of 40 years. The project is expected to remove\n26,281 tCO annually and 1,051,223 tCO throughout its life. PADO aims to achieve a group 2e 2e\ncarbon certification of its forest plantations, recovering 3,010 hectares (ha) from degraded\nforest reserves in a total project zone of 5,225ha. The Project Proponent will provide technical\nand administrative support for the project implementation and is responsible for all key\nactivities needed to issue and sell carbon offsets from reforestation trees.\n4\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_state_province': 'Ashanti Region', 'project_country': 'Ghana'}"}]}

In the process, an equivalent quantum of electricity that\nwould have been generated by the grid in line with the grid electricity generation mix\nis displaced by the project activity. The carbon intensity of the fossil-fuel dominated\ngeneration mix of the grid is evident from the following break-up of various types of\nenergy sources\nTable 2.1: Power generation mix of southern regional grid of India\n9 Refer to: http:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/methodologies\/SSCmethodologies\/approved.html\n10 Refer to: http:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/Reference\/COPMOP\/08a01.pdf#page=52\n11Refer to: The Southern Regional Electricity Grid of India is primarily constituted of fossil- fuel fired thermal power\nplants.

If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel, the\ncapacity of the entire unit shall not exceed the limit of 15MW\u201d.\nThe project activity involves only wind power generation. The gross wind power\ngeneration capacity of the bundled project activity is 11.60 MW which is less than 15\nMW, as stipulated in the applicability criterion under consideration.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n3. \u201cCombined heat and power (co-generation) systems are not eligible under\nthis category\u201d\nThe project activity involves generation of electricity only through WTGs and is not a\nco-generation system.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n4. \u201cIn the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy\ngeneration units at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added\ncapacity of the units added by the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be\nphysically distinct from the existing units.\u201d\nThe project activity does not involve the addition of renewable energy generation\nunits at an existing renewable power generation facility.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n5. \u201cProject activities that seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for\nrenewable energy generation are included in this category. To qualify as a small\nscale project, the total output of the modified or retrofitted unit shall not exceed the\nlimit of 15 MW\u201d\nThe renewable energy generating wind-farms employed by the project activity are\nnewly constructed set up and do not involve retrofitting or modification of any existing\nfacility for renewable energy generation.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\nThe same is being supported by the purchase orders from the WTG manufactures.\nThus, the project activity fulfills all the applicability criteria of the simplified small scale\nmethodology AMS-I.D.\/ Version 1414."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_methodologies': ['AMS-I.D.']}"}]}

It was\nstarted with the mission of getting subsistence farmers out of poverty by building a profitable forestry\nbusiness that connects thousands of small-scale tree farmers to high-value wood markets.\nKomaza\u2019s business model is unique in its promotion of decentralized smallholder forestry. Komaza works\nwith smallholder farmers on their own land, where the land remains under the ownership of the farmers,\nbut the trees are owned by Komaza, and the benefits are shared between the parties. Collectively, small-\nscale farmers possess enough land and labor resources to plant billions of trees, overcoming major barriers\nto commercial forestry in Kenya (namely access to land and high establishment cost), while developing\nparticularly strong environmental benefits.\n\u25cf Scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project\nKomaza currently operates in two main locations, Coastal Kenya within Kilifi and Kwale counties, and\nCentral Kenya within Nyandarua county.\nIn Coastal Kenya, a large share of the native ecosystem has already been lost, leaving a mosaic of lowland\nforest patches, bushlands and scrublands with mostly infertile soil. Farmers aren\u2019t used to planting trees,\nand terrestrial reforestation and afforestation efforts remain limited due to difficulties associated with the\nfragmented nature of the landscape and insufficient access to finance. Because of the increasing pressure\nfrom local economic development, in the absence of intervention it is likely that further land degradation\nwould occur, causing significant loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services.\nIn Central Kenya, a more fertile area than the coast, there is also environmental degradation caused by\nland use changes and poor agricultural practices. Some farmers already plant trees for timber and\nfuelwood, but not at a pace or in a way that can reverse the ongoing degradation, with large amounts of\nagricultural land still left fallow. In the absence of new large-scale, attractive tree growing initiatives, it is\nlikely that further land degradation would occur and increase the vulnerability of smallholder farmers to the\nimpacts of climate change.\n\u25cf How Komaza generates GHG emission removals\nKomaza works with smallholder farmers who own degraded, unused, or sub-utilized plots, to turn this land\ninto productive forestry (afforestation). Komaza provides high-quality seedlings, training, as well as tree\nmanagement and harvest services to farmers. No upfront cash investment nor forestry knowledge is\nrequired to participate. Farmers receive a fair payment at harvest, based on the volume of wood removed\nfrom the farm and the prevailing market prices.\n12\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nAs of 2022, Komaza has established over 8,000 ha of new commercial forests and has planted close to 7\nmillion trees involving over 25,000 smallholder farmers. Three species are planted namely the fast-growing\nhybrid Eucalyptus grandis x camaldulensis, Eucalyptus grandis and indigenous species Melia volkensii, all\nsuited for the local climatic conditions and product needs.\nThe project will include all Komaza\u2019s planting since 2017 and future planting in Kenya. Over the lifetime of\nthe project (30 years) Komaza will plant at least 45,088 ha of smallholder plantations with rotations of 8, 10\nand 15 years for Eucalyptus (Central), Eucalyptus (Coast) and Melia (Coast) respectively, both in replanting\nand coppicing management regimes. This grouped project will result in an annual average GHG removal\nof 212,780 tons over 30 years and a total GHG removal (long-term average) of 6,383,391 tCO2e.\n\u25cf Komaza\u2019s climate, community and biodiversity objectives\nCo-benefits from this project include, but not limited to:\n- New income opportunity for smallholder farmers, which doesn\u2019t require any cash investment and\nis climate-resilient\n- Dissemination of forestry knowledge and skills in the communities, including better environmental\nawareness\n- Women empowerment through innovative contract and payment model\n- Increased forest cover in a landscape that provides habitat for many species\n- Reduced land degradation and desertification\n- Reduced pressure on natural forests and other protected ecosystems"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_country': 'Kenya'}"}]}

Ngari is located in the southwest border of\nChina, the west of Tibet Autonomous Region and the north of Qinghai Tibet Plateau (Qiangtang\nplateau). The objective of the project is to restore the \"black soil beach14\" and degraded\ngrassland ecosystem through reseeding native grasses and grazing management, such as rest\ngrazing and grazing prohibition, increase carbon sequestration, and promote local development.\nThe project proponent is National Forestry and Grassland Administration Northwest Investigation\nand Planning Institute.\nThe project area is located in Ngari, covering Gar County, Burang County, Zanda County, Rutog\nCounty, G\u00ea'gyai County, G\u00earz\u00ea County and Coq\u00ean County. According to the Participatory Rural\nAppraisal (PRA) report. Before the implementation of the project, there were severely degradation\nand desertification of the grasslands in this area due to the impact of climate change and human\nactivities, some grassland even degenerated into \"black soil beach\", the excellent forages in the\nplant community almost disappeared, and the natural reproduction and renewal ability was very\nlow. According to the Parameters for Degradation, Desertification and Salinization of Rangeland\n(GB19377-2003) in China15, moderately degraded grassland areas refer to the total grass yield\ndecreased by 21%-50% compared with that before degradation and the total grass yield\ndecreased by more than 50% compared with that before degradation is regarded as severely\ndegraded grasslands.\nTotally, 373,467.02 ha of degraded grassland in Ngari have been managed sustainably including\nrest grazing and grazing prohibition by fence building and seeding of local high-quality forage.\nThere are three main restoration measures as followed in the project:\n(1) Rest grazing was implemented in moderately degraded grassland areas where grass yield\nwas 130-190kg\/Mu 16 which decreased by 21-50% compared with the non-degraded\ngrassland. It is required that grazing shall not be allowed within 120 days when the grass\nturns green every year (from 01-May to 31-August) through the construction of fence and\nsustainable management. Through the implementation of rest grazing, 322,770.02 ha of\ndegraded grassland were managed sustainably.\n(2) Grazing prohibition was implemented in seriously degraded grasslands where grass yield\nless than 130 Kg\/Mu which decreased by more than 50% compared with the non-degraded\ngrassland. Fence building shall be carried out in the grazing prohibition area. When the\nconstruction is completed, grazing prohibition shall be implemented for 5 years. After that,\n14 \"Black soil beach\" is an extreme type of grassland degradation caused by overgrazing, human factors, rat and\ninsect damage, climate warming and other factors.\n15GB19377-2003 is a national standard document of the people's Republic of China which issued by The Ministry of\nAgriculture and Rural Affairs to assess the level of degradation, desertification and salinization of natural grassland.\nThe original website of the standard is\nhttp:\/\/c.gb688.cn\/bzgk\/gb\/showGb?type=online&hcno=5F1960D0692A36C09136E04E6DE60B4E\n16 1ha=15 Mu\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 9\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nunder the premise of not affecting the normal growth of the improved grassland, the\ngrassland should be used reasonably and sustainably according to the local approved\nlivestock carrying capacity. For the project, totally 40,801.00 ha of degraded grassland have\nbeen managed sustainably by grazing prohibition.\n(3) Black soil beach restoration was implemented in moderately degraded grassland areas\nwhere grass yield was less than 150 Kg\/Mu and the proportion of bare patches in grassland\nexceeds 40% which decreased by 21%-50% compared with the non-degraded grassland.\nReseeding grass, scientific fertilization and irrigation are carried out to restore grassland\nvegetation greatly based on rodent and pest control on the \"black soil beach\" degraded\ngrassland in the project area. After reseeding the grass, the project area needs to be fenced\nfor 3 years to better restore grassland vegetation. Then under the premise of not affecting the\nnormal growth of the improved grassland, the grassland should be used reasonably and\nsustainably according to the local approved livestock carrying capacity. The grass seeds\nsowed were local high-quality forage such as Elymus nutans (Drooping tassel grass). In the\nproject, 9,896.00 ha of \"black soil\" degraded grassland have been reseeded grass.\nIn addition to these main restoration measures, the project also alleviates soil desertification and\nrestores grassland vegetation through grassland management measures to improve soil carbon\nstorage and local biodiversity, supplemented by daily management measures of other protection\nprojects, such as grassland fire prevention and rodent control, so as to ensure long-term\nsustainable management of the project area. The project is estimated to generate GHG emission\nremovals of 11,698,413 tCO e in 40 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 2\n292,460 tCO e. 2\nThe objectives of the project including:\nClimate: Restore the degraded grassland ecosystem, increase grassland coverage, increase\ngrassland carbon sink function and reduce GHG emissions.\nCommunity: Improve the livelihood of local herders, provide permanent and temporary job\nopportunities for them, increase their income. Provide technical skills and training in sustainable\ngrassland management. Protect the sacred mountains (Kang Rinpoche) and holy waters (Lake\nManasarovar) widely respected by the Tibetan people which is conducive to the protection and\ndevelopment of Tibet's traditional Zhangzhung culture. Zhangzhung culture is the traditional\nculture of the Tibetan people, also known as the basic culture of Tibet. The traces of ancient\nZhangzhung culture run through all aspects of Tibet. From production to life, from folk custom17 to\nbelief, there is the shadow of Zhangzhung culture everywhere. For example, religious activities\nsuch as offering sacrifices to mountain gods and turning mountains18 are all derived from the\nZhangzhung culture.\nBiodiversity: Provide more suitable habitats for wild animals and increase local biodiversity.\n17 The ancient Zhangzhung Buddha dharma occupies the supreme position in the traditional culture of ancient\nZhangzhung culture. It is the oldest Buddha Dharma in Tibet, the oldest Buddha Dharma in human history, and the\ngeneral source of all Buddha dharmas\n18 A way for Tibetans to show piety\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 10\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nFigure 2-1 The restored degraded grassland in the project area"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_state_province': 'Tibet', 'project_country': 'China'}"}]}

Social well-being\nThe proposed project activity leads to direct and indirect employment benefits accruing out of ancillary\nunits for manufacturing towers for erecting the WTGs and for maintenance during operation of the\nproject activity. The infrastructure in and around the project area will also improve due to project\nactivities. This includes development of road network and improvement of the quality of electricity in\nterms of its availability and frequency as the generated electricity is fed into a deficit grid.\n2. Economic well-being\nThe project contributes to the economic sustainability around the plant site, which is promotion of\ndecentralization of economic power, leading to diversification of the national energy supply, which is\ndominated by conventional fuel based generating units. The generated electricity is fed into the Western\nRegion of NEWNE Grid through local grid, thereby improving the grid frequency and availability of\nelectricity in the region which will provide new opportunities for industries and economic activities to be\nsetup in the area thereby resulting in greater local employment, ultimately leading to overall\ndevelopment.\n3. Environmental well-being\nThe project utilizes wind energy for generating electricity which otherwise would have been generated\nthrough alternate fuels (primarily fossil fuel) based power plants, thereby contributing to the reduction in\nair, water and solid waste emissions, apart from GHG emissions. Being a renewable resource, using wind\nenergy to generate electricity contributes to resource conservation.\n4. Technological well-being\nThe project activity leads to the promotion of renewable energy generation by wind, demonstrating the\nsuccess of wind turbine generators in the region, which feed the generated power into the nearest sub-\nstation, thus increasing energy availability and improving quality of power under the service area of the\nsubstation. Hence, the project leads to technological well-being.\nIn view of the above, the project participant considers that the project activity profoundly contributes to\nthe sustainable development"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

The land cover in the grouped project area is degraded pasture.\nWithout intervention, it is expected that this cover would remain or that it would be partially reforested at a\nrate of reforestation that has been commonly observed in the periods prior to the VCS proposal mainly\nbecause the socio-economic conditions that created them are still and will continue to be present. A multi-\ntemporal assessment of land use changes, using satellite images, was developed, in order to prove the\nstate of land cover until 2011. These grasslands have been degraded by the ranching activity that\ntraditionally has taken place in the entire Orinoco region29.\n28 https:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/methodologies\/DB\/WB63WYT7LKF8N6V0A3YXXXI8GCP2J3\n29 Alcald\u00eda Municipal de La Primavera Vichada. Esquema de Ordenamiento Territorial La Primavera Vichada 2000:\nDimensi\u00f3n Econ\u00f3mica. Available at: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1laVeP6; Accessed: 10 May 2013.\nv3.2 38\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nIn the specific case of the department of Vichada the soils are of sedimentary origin and have undergone\nvarious weathering processes. Aided by the tropical climate, these weathering processes have intensively\nwashed away minerals and nutrients, resulting in poor soils. In terms of their physical characteristics, the\nsoils have good internal drainage due to their clay loam and sandy loam texture and their loose and\nporous granular structure. They have a low organic material content, and likewise contain low\nconcentrations of magnesium, phosphorous and potassium30.\nConsidering these physical characteristics, as well as the great extension of savannas that contrast with\nthe forest remnants (principally gallery forest), and the extensive ranching throughout the region, it is\nimprobable that the soils will recover and that forest cover will naturally reestablish itself in these areas.\nThe grazing and fire that has affected the land for many years impedes the natural regeneration of the\nforest.\nb) Soil disturbance attributable to the afforestation and reforestation (A\/R) VCS project activity does not\ncover more than 10 per cent of area in each of the following types of land, when these lands are included\nwithin the project boundary:\n(i) Land containing organic soils.\n(ii) Land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and receives\ninputs listed in appendices 1 and 2 to this methodology.\nThe proposed project activity does not take place on organic soils. In the absence of the project activity,\nthe baseline is expected to remain unmanaged grasslands. Such grasslands under tropical conditions\nhave less soil carbon compared to plantations. Therefore, not accounting for soil organic carbon is a\nconservative approach for the project case as it is expected to increase less in the absence of the project\nactivity relative to the baseline.\nIn addition to this, in the project area the weathering processes have intensively washed away minerals\nand nutrients, resulting in poor soils. They have a low organic material content, and likewise contain low\nconcentrations of magnesium, phosphorous and potassium31 .\nIn terms of planting implementation, there are activities that involve soil disturbation as nurseries, clonal\nareas, parent plant growing areas, single blade ripping for planting and the fire breaks. Firebreaks of\nabout 5 meters wide are commonly cut into the soil between farms as a way of keeping the regular fires\nfrom overlapping property boundaries. This practice is performed because the farmers regularly burn the\nsavannas for production of appropriate fodder for their cattle. The project area of the first instance also\ncuts approximately 5.7 meter wide that are install along the boundaries of the planting areas. These\nfirebreaks are legally acceptable by the environmental authority as a means to not only control inter\nproperty fires, but to also help keep the gallery forests from burning. Even though this is considered\ncommon practice, the soil disturbance associated with this activity was included in the calculations of soil\ndisturbance across the entire property. Total, the percentage was less than 7% when considering the\nentire active plantable areas for the project .Estimations are provided as supporting evidence of this\nvalue.\n30 De la Espriella, R., Fl\u00f3rez, R., Galvis, J., Gonz\u00e1lez, C.F., Mari\u00f1o, J. y Pinto, H. 1990.

The end-user technology in the case of this project can\nbe established as the project proponent, who utilizes the thermal\nenergy generated by the new renewable energy technology.\nThere are no similar registered small-scale CDM project activities in\nthe region of Panorama once Social Carbon Company made a research and\ndid not find any registered small\u2013scale CDM Project activity in the\nregion. The sources of registered small-scale CDM project activity\nconsulted were the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange (UNFCCC)17 and Brazilian\u2019s Technology and Science Ministry18.\nTherefore, the proposed project activity is not saving the non-\nrenewable biomass accounted by the other registered project activities.\nThe utilization of firewood from area without any kind of management\ncan not be considered a renewable source of biomass, since it involves\na decrease of carbon pools and increases the carbon emissions to the\natmosphere, turning green house effect even worse. Moreover, the native\nwood provided from areas without a reforestation management plan does\nnot fit any of the options of UNFCCC definition of renewable biomass in\nAnnex 18, EB 23.\nFurthermore, firewood has been used for many decades as fuel in Brazil.\nAlthough, it is impossible to define a start date on which this kind of\nnon-renewable biomass began to be applied, there are many documents to\nprove that wood has been used for thermal energy generation before 1989\nas requested in the applied methodology. Firewood used to be the most\nemployed source of primary energy until de decade of 1970, when the\n17 CDM activities registered by CDM Executive board are Available at:<\n<http:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/Projects\/registered.html>. Accessed in January 15th, 2009.\n18 Brazilian\u00b4s Technology and Science Ministry is responsible for registry and approval\nof all CDM activities within Brazilian boundaries. CDM activities submitted to the\nBrazilian Inter-Ministerial Commission of CDM Activities are available at:\n<http:\/\/www.mct.gov.br\/index.php\/content\/view\/47952.html>. Accessed in January 15th,\n2009.\n13\n\nSol Nascente Ceramic VCS Project Description\npetroleum started to supply the majority of Brazilian\u2019s energy needs19.\nMoreover the Brazilian\u2019s Energy and Mine Ministry has been monitoring\nevery energetic sectors of Brazil since 1970, and firewood appears over\nthe years monitored as a significant source of thermal energy for\nceramic sector20. Especially in the ceramic sector, the use of firewood\nis visible non-renewable and unsustainable, involving negative\nenvironmental impacts associated21.\nThis way, it can be concluded that non-renewable biomass has been used\nsince 31 December 1986.\nThe biomasses utilized in the project, sugar cane bagasse and sawdust,\nare common residues in the region generated. Bagasse is generated by\nindustries to produce alcohol. Each ton of sugar cane used for alcohol\nproduction generates around 140 kg of sugar cane bagasse, which can be\neither compacted into briquettes or utilized in natura for thermal\nenergy generation 22 . Sawdust\/wood chips are resulted from wood\nmanufacturing.\nS\u00e3o Paulo is a huge peanut producer and the peanut shell is a residue\ngenerated from this production.\nSawdust, wood chips, peanut shells and sugar cane bagasse are all\nindustries residues coming from large scale reforestation or\nagroindustrial projects, so it is considered renewable according to\noption V of methodology definition of renewable biomass: \u201cThe biomass\nis the non-fossil fraction of an industrial or municipal waste\u201d.\nThe elephant grass is considered renewable according to option III, as\nsoon as it fits all the assumptions below:\n\u201cThe biomass is non-woody biomass and originates from croplands and\/or\ngrasslands where:\n(a) The land area remains cropland and\/or grasslands or is reverted to\nforest; and\n(b) Sustainable management practices are undertaken on these land areas\nto ensure in particular that the level of carbon stocks on these land\nareas does not systematically decrease over time (carbon stocks may\ntemporarily decrease due to harvesting); and\n(c) Any national or regional forestry, agriculture and nature\nconservation regulations are complied with.\u201d"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

In 2005 NEK generated 90% of the Bulgarian electricity from its own production plants, and assumes a\nsingle buyer role as the owner and operator of the National electricity transmission system.\nIn February 2005 independent Power Plants (IPPs) represented 10% of Bulgarian electricity production. Those\nIPPs were a mixture of assets which have been purchased from NEK\/the State via the privatisation process which\nis still ongoing. In 2005 the Czech energy producer CEZ bought three Bulgarian Distribution companies in western\nBulgaria, among them the local distribution company to which the Katuntsi project intended to deliver the produced\nelectricity.\nBulgarian electricity consumption has fallen by 28% since 1990 (prior to the economic collapse) to 26.4 TWh in\n20031. Electricity generation exceeds demand from Bulgaria\u2019s population of 7.8 million, with 16% of production\nbeing exported to neighbouring states. NEK became a full member of UCTE in May 2003 which allow access to an\neven greater export market in the future.\nFigure 5 illustrates Bulgaria\u2019s electricity generation capacity by fuel type in 2004. Thermal power represented 52%\nof the installed capacity. The nuclear component of the capacity has been reduced over the past 5 years as\nBulgaria has been encouraged to decommission its Soviet built Kozloduy Nuclear power plant as part of package\nof measures in preparation for EU Accession in 2007\/8. The Kozloduy decommissioning schedule has proceeded\nas follows, units 1 and 2 with a combined capacity of 880MW commenced decommissioning in 2002, units 3 and 4\n(880MW) were decommissioned in 2006 and there is no firm plan for the remaining units 5 and 6 which have a\ncombined capacity of 2000MW.\nFigure 5, Power generation structure Bulgaria (NEK EAD, Annual Report 2004)\nFigure 6 illustrates the historic production fuel mix in Bulgaria. Whilst the government is keen to increase the\nelectricity generated by renewable sources as the nuclear capacity is decommissioned, the reality of the situation is\nthat there is likely to be an increasing dependence on thermal generation.\nA factor in Bulgarian governments desire to stimulate investment in renewable energy is to reduce the countries\ndependence on imported fossil fuels, over 50% of the thermal power plants consume imported fossil fuels.\nThermal generation consuming local fuels are dependent on Lignite which is characterised by poor environmental\nqualities and low efficiencies. The national grid emission factors presented in section 4. of this document show the\nghg emission intensity of the Bulgarian electricity system.\n1 NEK EAD, National Institute of Statistics, 2004\n7\n\n[[''], [''], [''], [''], ['']]\nBulgarian Electricity Production Mix\n100\n80\n60 Nuclaer\n% Thermal\n40 Hydro\n20\n0\n90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03\n19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 20 20 20 20\nFigure 6, Bulgarian Electricity Production Mix 1990 \u2013 2003.\nRenewable Support\nAt the time of the project planning in 2004, the Bulgarian Government has introduced support mechanism for\nrenewables to stimulate investment. Hydro electric power generation plants with a capacity of less than 10MW are\nconsidered to be Renewable Energy sources within Bulgarian Energy law, therefore the Katuntsi SHPP qualifies.\nThe most recent Bulgarian energy law affecting the investment decision was introduced on the 9th December 2003.\nChapter 11 of the law details the promotion of power generation from renewable energy resources and combined\nheat and power generation. Bulgaria planed to set targets for the percentage of gross national electricity demand\nto be met by renewable energy resources.\nIn 2005 Bulgaria\u2019s power distribution and transmission companies were obliged by law (article 159 of the Energy\nLaw) to purchase all electricity produced by renewable and cogeneration sources at preferential prices. The\npreferential prices were defined by the State Energy Regulation Commission. The preferential price paid to the\ngenerators of green electricity should be no lower than 80% of the average supply price of electricity for domestic\nconsumers for the previous calendar year (article 33 -2 of the energy law). In December 2003 the State Energy\nRegulation Commission had fixed the preferential prices for renewable technologies which are reviewed annually.\nThe State Energy Regulatory Commission has allocated Katuntsi SHPP a price of \u20ac40.90\/MWh for 2005.\nThe revised energy law of December 2003 sets out a timetable to replace the preferential price system with a\nTradable Green Certificate (TGC) scheme. The TGC scheme is an alternative support mechanism to stimulate\ninvestment and operation of renewables and cogeneration. TGCs are considered to be a more efficient incentive\nfor renewable energy and cogeneration which compliments the development of the liberalised energy market. The\nTGC scheme offers an incentive to renewable and cogeneration generators by separating the \u2018green certificate\u2019\ncomponent of the output (the TGC) from the underlying power component (the electricity). Renewable electricity\nproducers then have two products, the electricity which may be sold as ordinary power on to the grid, and the TGC\nwhich may be sold to other producers of conventional power who have a target imposed on them for green\ncertificates (TGCs). The issuance of certificates of origin of electricity was introduced in July 2004 as a perquisite\nfor the introduction of the TGC scheme. A quota system for renewable generation was planned to be introduced in\nJanuary 2006, but until mid 2007 it was still not launched and it is not clear when it will be implemented,\n(assumedly in 2010). Further until the quotas are set the value of the TGCs is unclear to the market, thus causing\nprice uncertainty for renewable energy project operators2."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

This goal will be achieved\nthrough the expansion of monitoring of the area, along with the inclusion of the local community\nin the project activities, with environmental education and alternative sources of income to\nminimize risks of invasion and deforestation within the project area and the reference region.\nAs aforementioned throughout this project description document, the present REDD Project plans\nto implement a program regarding the extraction of NTFPs as a way of providing an alternative\nincome source for the local communities that surround the project area.\nBrazilian law such as Decree No. 6,040 ensures the rights of traditional people and communities\nof attaining sustainable development, and by this, activities such as collection of forest products\nare permitted as long as they do not cause any damage to the area in question50. Hereupon, the\nproject proponents neither can (by law) or want to prohibit the local communities from collecting\nNTFP in the project area.\nMoreover, the project activities will enable the creation of jobs to monitor the area, prioritizing\nthe hiring of local residents for monitoring of the area, with professional training. Income from\nthe sale of credits will make it possible to invest in the educational and professional training of\nchildren and adults in the community.\nIn this way, the owners are committed and add value to the carbon project with each action taken,\nencouraging long-term sustainable development and driving continuous improvement in the local\ncommunity through prospects (at least one per Resource, totaling 6 improvement actions), on\nwhich the project proponent undertakes to implement them until the next monitoring period.\nCommercially Sensitive Information\nNo commercially sensitive information has been excluded from the public version of the project\ndescription.\nFurther Information\nNo further information to disclose.\n2 SAFEGUARDS\n2.1 No Net Harm\nThe project is designed so that there are no negative impacts.

For such cases, the tool suggests using the following criteria to determine the\nexistence of significant transmission constraints:\n1. \u201cIn case of electricity systems with spot markets for electricity: there are differences in electricity\nprices (without transmission and distribution costs) of more than 5 percent between the systems\nduring 60 percent or more of the hours of the year.\u201d This criteria is not applicable as there is no\nspot electricity market in the host country.\n2. \u201cThe transmission line is operated at 90% or more of its rated capacity during 90% percent or\nmore of the hours of the year\u201d: The transmission line operator (TEIAS) or any other official source\nhas not published the capacity usage figures for the Turkish grid, hence this criterion can not be\nproved.\nAccording to the tool, where the application of these criteria does not result in a clear grid\nboundary, a regional grid definition in the case of large countries with layered dispatch systems\n(e.g. provincial \/ regional \/ national) shall be used. A provincial grid definition may indeed in many\ncases be too narrow given significant electricity trade among provinces that might be affected,\ndirectly or indirectly, by a CDM project activity. In other countries, the national (or other largest)\ngrid definition should be used by default.\nTherefore, for the case of the subject project activity \u201cthe project electricity system\u201d and \u201cthe\nconnected system\u201d are same, and the Turkish National Grid is used as the \u201cproject electricity\nsystem\u201d. It is also confirmed by TEIAS that the Turkish grid is interconnected. There isn\u2019t any\nindependent or regional grid system in any region of Turkey. The map of the Turkish Electricity\nGrid is given in the below figure (Figure 10):\nv3.0 28\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nFigure 10: The Map showing the boundaries of Turkish Electricity Grid (Source Electricity Market\nReport 2010, by Electricity Market Regulatory Authority\nhttp:\/\/www.epdk.gov.tr\/documents\/10157\/48dd12d4-74da-4dcf-9f48-86983146c0d8)\nAll the calculations details of which are given below are made for the entire Turkish Grid.\nStep 2 - Choose whether to include off-grid power plants in the project electricity system\nThe tool requires Project participants to choose between the following two options to calculate the\noperating margin and build margin emission factor:\nOption I: Only grid power plants are included in the calculation.\nOption II: Both grid power plants and off-grid power plants are included in the calculation.\nIn our case, \u201cOption I\u201d has been selected for the calculation of grid emission factor, and only grid\npower plants are included in the calculation.\nStep 3 \u2013 Select an operating margin (OM) method\nAccording to the \u201cTool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system\u201f, version 02.2.1 in\ncalculating the Operating Margin grid emission factor for a given year y (EFgrid,OM, y), project\ndevelopers have the option of selecting from four methods:\n(a) Simple OM,\n(b) Simple adjusted OM,\n(c) Dispatch Data Analysis OM, or\nv3.0 29"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

However, due to changes in government (1970-1980s) and the\nconsequential lack of implementation of policies, this forest was gradually\ndeforested. The reserve has been subjected to continued degradation, especially\nover the last few decades where a significant increase in subsistence activities,\nsuch as cultivation and grazing activities, fuel-wood collection, and charcoal\nproduction have been witnessed, reducing a denser rainforest to a landscape with\nscarce pockets of trees. By 1980s, the proposed ARR VCS project area had\nbecome non-forest land. Furthermore, continued human activities such as\nfrequent burning, grazing, shifting cultivation, fuel wood collection resulted in\nsevere forest and soil degradation. This rendered the areas useless and were\nconsequently abandoned.\nTo demonstrate that the land within the project boundary is eligible for an ARR\nVCS project activity, steps outlined in the \u2018Procedures to define the eligibility of\nlands for forestation and reforestation CDM project activities, version 1\u2019 were\nfollowed. The applicable step for the Kibale project was (a) (i) as follows:\n(a) Demonstrate that the land at the moment the project starts does not contain\nforest:\n(i) Vegetation on the land is below the forest national thresholds (crown\ncover, tree height and minimum land area) for the forest definition\nunder decisions 11\/CP.7 and 19\/CP.9 as communicated by the\nrespective DNA.\nThe Climate Change Secretariat (DNA) for Uganda has defined and communicated\nthe national forest thresholds as land which has a:\n\u2022 Minimum area of 1 hectare\n\u2022 Minimum tree crown cover of 30 %; and\n\u2022 A minimum height of 5 meters at maturity\nBased on this definition by the Uganda DNA, the project area is eligible for ARR\nVCS activities because it consists of areas with grass and shrubs with a few\nscattered trees, and other areas with banana plantations (i.e. cropland). The\nplantable areas delineated on the basis of the above definitions are \u201cformerly\nencroached areas with dominant elephant grass\u201d, shown in Figure 1.7.1, which\nfalls well below the national forest definition. Figure 1.7.1 was developed in 1995\nduring a land evaluation study by Ancker and Jungerius. This map includes\ncategories showing other areas such as Park area, forest, quartzite ridges and\ninselbergs, non-forested riverine lands, and open spaces which are not part of the\n12\n\nVCS Project Description Template\nVCS project activity.

Ms. Jain further explained that by using the source of energy that are harmful,\nthere is more pollution; and that the ill effects of pollution are now increasing getting well\nknown to one and all. She said that by putting wind turbines which are a clean source of\nenergy, the environment will get benefited and it will be cleaner. She also briefly spoke about\nthe benefits of these projects to the villages, the development that also came about in the\nsurrounding area because of installing these wind turbines. She told Wind farm projects apart\nfrom providing employment opportunities are also providing the Education, Medical and\nInfrastructure facilities to the society. Development activities accomplished by Suzlon are the\nbest example of sustainable development in this region.\nCommon Queries from Stake Holders and response by the project proponent are listed below:\n1. How other source of power generation leads to pollution?\nAs power is generated mainly from fossil fuels dominated power plants which leads to\nemissions of CO , NO & SO and hence, it generates pollution. 2 X 2\n2. Will the project help in improving the electricity supply to the villagers or the\nneighborhood areas?\nIt is expected as power generated from wind is fed to state electricity grid.\nCommon Queries from representative of project proponent and responses by the Stakeholders\nare as follows:\n1. Did project provide employment opportunities or improve economic development of\narea?\nYes, a lot of people from the nearby villages have gained employment either directly or\nindirectly form these projects. The wind farm has created a requirement of drivers for the\nvehicle catering in these projects. These drivers are either directly employed by Suzlon or\nwork with owner with Taxis, carrying personnel to and from the site. There has also been\na requirement of security guards for the projects.\nAll these people that have received employment are from surrounding areas and would\nhave migrated to nearby towns in search of livelihood. But, now they do not need to go\nfar from their villages. They have got work nearby and are also available to help their\nfamilies in the fields with the crops, especially during the harvesting seasons. This has\nbrought a lot of convenience to these individuals. If they had to work in a town elsewhere,\nthey would have to leave their home in the village; stay, eat, sleep at another place, with\nno recourse in time of need, sickness etc. Now, as they are closer to their family, they are\nmore comfortable, healthier then they would have been in a city, more prosperous, and\nsatisfied that for a sake of job they have not to leave their home and go far, with no\nknowledge as to where will they stay, eat etc. and who will look after their families and\nparents back home in the villages. Though, they may have got money elsewhere also, but\nstaying at home has brought them a better quality of life.\nApart from this, contracts for civil work have also given to local villagers. Other work\npertaining to these projects have helped the local villagers also such as couriers, office\nautomation facilities such as photocopying, printing\/ fax- services, hiring of transport\nservices, civil contracts etc. People either, Suzlon employees or customers, vendors etc.\ncome to Dhule and Nandurbar, and they require a place to stay. This has led to the\n35\n\nVCS Project Description\nsettings up of small hotels, Suzlon\u2019s guest houses which employ the local people and also\nprocure supplies locally too for the running of these establishments. This has lead to the\nall \u2013 around development of the region with employment, growth and avenues of\nprosperity coming to these areas rather than requiring the local people to migrate from\nhere to other bigger towns such as Pune \/ Aurangabad \/ Mumbai and further adding to the\ngrowing congestion there. These are not one-time but continuous and ongoing ventures\nthat are providing a stable income and good life and health to these people.\nSuzlon has also set up a canteen which arranges for the food for the employees working at\nthe site. This canteen provides employment to the people who cook the food and also\nprocure the supplies for the food locally, leading to all \u2013 around development. Also, as a\nresult of this facility, the employees who are staying in the nearby villages are also\nbenefited since they gain from better working conditions than what was before the site\ncame up when there was no facility.\nThere is also a modern dispensary for the villagers. A doctor, assistants, and medicines\nare routinely available and dispensed amongst the villagers. There also a two well \u2013\nequipped Ambulance available, which the villagers can use, irrespective of whether they\nuse the facilities of the dispensary or not, and to transport them quickly in case of an\nemergency. The ambulance is sufficiently well -equipped to handle a medical emergency.\nFacilities such as oxygen cylinders have also been made available which were not here\nearlier.\nSuzlon has also done other development work in the infrastructure of the villages such as\nthe construction bandha (small dams), a village temple etc.\n2. Should such projects be promoted?\nYes, more of these projects should be brought here.\n3. Do the project personnel and authorities maintain a good relationship with\nvillagers?\nYes, there is a good relationship between us.\n4. Is there any problem for any other activity that you were carrying in the past at the\nsite?\nNo, there is no disruption in any other activity that we were carrying out before the\ninstallation of these turbines or the construction of this wind farm.\nVote of Thanks\nRepresentatives of Suzlon along with all the representatives of the various companies who\nhad participated thanked the villagers for their time and the effort taken to come to the venue\nof the Meeting, and also that the villagers shared their frank opinion. These representatives\nwere happy that the villagers also thought in the same manner as them that wind power was a\nclean source of energy and therefore beneficial to the environment.

Therefore the Project activities comply with national and local regulations\nlike the Forest Code and the Constitution of 1988.\nConclusion: The Consistency Analysis shows that all three scenarios are in compliance with\nmandatory legislation and regulations taking into account their enforcement in the region. In the case of\nunplanned logging that is an agent that precedes deforestation by ranchers, it has been proven that there\nis lack of enforcement is widely spread not only in Portel but also in Para.\n2.5.2 STEP 2: Investment analysis to determine that the proposed Project\nactivity is not the most economically or financially attractive of the\nidentified land-use scenarios\nThe simple cost analysis is basically a Project cost description along the crediting period. It aims to\ndemonstrate all the costs associated to development and implementation of the Project. When Projects\nhave no other revenue but the carbon credits, it is allowed to use this financial analysis\n104\n\nDue to the fact that the Project is a conservation Project with no other sources of income besides carbon\nrevenues, a simple cost analysis (Annex 1) will be applied to prove additionality. Given that carbon credit\nrevenue is the only source of financing for this Project, without this source (or the future expectation of\ncarbon finance) no AUD activities could be implemented and BaU baseline scenarios would take place in\nthe Project Area.\nSince the beginning of the Project, the AUD activities were envisioned to be feasible only if carbon credits\nrevenue would be available. This is made evident by the documents presented (Annex 1). Furthermore,\ninitial financing for the Project, received exclusively from private investors will cover 100% of the Project\u2019s\ncosts over the first years. Again, this is a clear indication that without carbon finance Project activities\ncannot be undertaken and therefore are additional.\nIn conclusion it is demonstrated that a large amount of initial capital is required for the set-up of the\nProject.

This section will present highlights of the process.\n3.1 Baseline Emissions\n3.1.1 Selection of the baseline approach\nFor the projection of future deforestation in the baseline scenario, approach \u201cA\u201d of the VM0015\nmethodology was selected, given that the rate of baseline deforestation is assumed to be a continuation\nof the average annual rate measured during the historical reference period (1996-2008) within the\nreference region. The past observed deforestation rate is calculated by comparing the area under forest\ncover in satellite imagery classifications for the reference region at two different times.\nAccording to the VM0015 methodology, the annual rate of forest change must be calculated as follows:\nWhere:\nRBSLRR = Deforestation rate within the reference region (Puyravaud, 2003) t\nARR = Area with forest cover at year 1996 (ha) = 1,853,595.1 ha t1\nARR = Area with forest cover at year 2008 (ha) = 1,508,804.0 ha t2\nt1= Start date of the historical reference period (year=1996)\nt2= End date of the historical reference period (year=2008)\nRBSLRR = -1.70 % t\nThen, a Similarity-Weighted Instance-based Machine Learning algorithm with a Markov chain model\nbased on the past observed deforestation rate is performed to predict areas vulnerable to forest changes\nusing multi-temporal remote sensing data.\n107"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

Location and Quantification of Threat of Unplanned Deforestation\nSpatial analysis was conducted with the IDRISI SELVA software (Eastman 2011), and the Land Change\nModeler (LCM) which is an integrated software environment. LCM is a spatially-explicit modeling tool that\nwas used to model the location of deforestation projected in the baseline for both the project area and\nleakage belt. LCM was developed by Clark Labs in conjunction with the Andes Center of Biodiversity\nConservation of Conservation International, and has been tested extensively in the South America (Clark\nLabs 2007). LCM provides a wide range of tools organized in a series of steps for analyzing land cover\nchange; modeling potential for change; predicting change and validating results. For this analysis, LCM\nwas used to produce a vulnerability map of the project area and leakage belt. Translation of the\nvulnerability map into a scenario map of deforestation through the project term was conducted with a rank\nand assign operation. This model meets the criteria of (1) being peer-reviewed, (2) transparent, (3)\nincorporating spatial datasets used to explain patterns of deforestation, and (4) is capable of projecting\nthe location of future deforestation (Kim 2010, Sangermano et al., 2010, Eastman et al., 2005).45\nAll spatial modeling analysis is performed on the reference region for projecting location of deforestation\n(RRL). The RRL is defined in section 3.1.1 and encompasses the area surrounding the project area and\nleakage belt (see Figure 3.1). Information from the reference region is analyzed under a spatially explicit\nmodeling framework to construct future scenarios of how deforestation can be allocated in the reference\nregion. In conformance with the VCS modular REDD methodology VM0007, location analysis was\nconducted since the initial configuration of the RRL landscape was a frontier configuration."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

This project improves GHG emissions reductions from forest management practices by\nincreasing on-land carbon stocks by extending the rotation period of a forest or a small area of forest\nbefore harvesting. By extending the age at which trees are felled, projects increase the average\ncarbon stock on the land and remove more emissions from the atmosphere.\nThe total area of the project is 18,959.15 ha in Yuexi County. All the trees are native species,\nincluding Pinus armandi, Alder and Pinus yunnanensis.\nThe project aims to mitigate the effects of climate change by increasing the average carbon stock on the\nland and removing more emissions from the atmosphere by extending the age at which trees are felled,\nthereby promoting sustainable forest management, productive activities and improving community\nwelfare. The project also seeks to protect biodiversity and high conservation values, enhance ecological\nconnectivity, and protect the natural habitats of vulnerable species, both those under some kind of threat\nand those of ecological interest.\nMoreover, expected GHG reductions corresponds to an annual average of 239,399 tCO , so for the 2\nlifetime of 60 years it could demonstrate reductions up to 14,363,970 tCO . 2"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_country': 'China', 'project_latitude': 28.33}"}]}

Brief explanation of how the anthropogenic emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gas\n(GHGs) by sources are to be reduced by the proposed small-scale project activity, including why\nthe emission reductions would not occur in the absence of the proposed small-scale project\nactivity, taking into account national and\/or sectoral policies and circumstances:\n(a) Reduction of emissions\nThe proposed project activity will displace predominantly coal based power supply of the North West\nChina Grid with zero GHG emission small-scale hydropower. The displaced power results in\nsignificant greenhouse emissions. Thus the proposed project activity will result in significant GHG\nemission reductions.\n(b) National and sectoral policies\nThe main sectoral policy relevant to this project activity is the promotion of renewable energy in\nChina, as evident in the currently promulgated renewable energy law (the Renewable Energy Law of\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China), which took effect on 1 Jan. 2006, and in the long-term target that in\n2020, 15% of power generation should be from renewable resources. The Chinese government\nprioritizes the development of renewable energy in the energy development strategy and encourages\ngrid-connected power generation from renewable sources. However, there are no direct incentives\nsuch as financial grants or subsidized loans.\nThe precise practical implementation of the law is not yet decided, but will involve various measures\nto increase the attractiveness of renewable power vis-\u00e0-vis conventional power. Thus, the instruments\nused under the Renewable Energy Law will be of type \u201cE-\u201d, and can according to the guidelines of\nEB222, be ignored when developing the baseline scenario.\n2 The \u201cClarifications on the treatment of national and\/or sectoral policies and regulations (paragraph 45 (e) of\nthe CDM Modalities and Procedures) in determining a baseline scenario\u201d were originally adopted during\nEB16 (Annex 3) and were further revised during EB22 (Annex 3) as the \u201cClarification on the consideration\nof national and\/or sectoral policies and circumstances in baseline scenario\u201d. For further details we refer to:\nthe UNFCCC website: http:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/EB\/022\/eb22_repan3.pdf\nThis template shall not be altered. It shall be completed without modifying\/adding headings or logo, format or font.\n\nCDM-SSC-PDD (version 02)\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board page 9\n(c) Additionality\nHydropower has made significant contributions to the expansion of power supply in Gansu Province\nover the last few decades. However, new hydropower additions to the grid, in particular small\nhydropower stations, experience increasingly unattractive economic returns on investment. The\nreasons for this are that the most suitable locations for hydropower projects have already been used,\nand new projects are located in remote areas driving up the costs of hydropower per kWh. In addition,\nthe engineering costs in China are rapidly rising.\nThe proposed project activity experiences significant barriers in its implementation, which consist of\nthe unattractive economic returns on investment and the difficulties in arranging financing. The\nbarriers to implementation are further illustrated and elaborated in Section B3. Registration of the\nproject as a CDM activity would result in additional income flows, which would increase the\nattractiveness of the project and would allow it to overcome the above-mentioned barriers."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

Option B is used to\ncalculate the Simple OM. The relevant formula as given in the Grid Tool is\nWhere:\nEF = Simple operating margin CO emission factor in year y (tCO \/MWh) grid,OMsimple,y 2 2\nEG = Net quantity of electricity generated and delivered to the grid by power unit m in year y (MWh) m,y\nEF = CO emission factor of power unit m in year y (tCO \/MWh) EL,m,y 2 2\n13\n\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-PDD) - Version 03\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board\nm = All power units serving the grid in year y except low-cost \/ must-run power units\ny = the three most recent years for which data is available at the time of submission of the CDM-PDD to\nthe DOE for validation (ex ante option)\nWe used the ex ante approach to calculate the Simple OM, namely, \u201cA 3 year generation weighted\naverage, based on the most recent data available at the time of submission of the CDM-PDD to the DOE\nfor validation\u201d The latest generation statistics available from the CEB at this time was for the calendar\nyear 2007. We have therefore used data for the three years 2005, 2006 and 2007 to calculate the OM.\nCalculation of BM emissions factor\nAs per the Grid Tool all plants (including hydro), other than plants which have been registered as CDM\nactivities, must be considered for calculating the build margin (BM). Equation 12 of the Grid tool for\ncalculating the BM is taken for this project.\nWhere:\nEF = Build margin CO emission factor in year y (tCO \/MWh) grid,BM,y 2 2\nEG = Net quantity of electricity generated and delivered to the grid by power unit m in year y (MWh) m,y\nEF = CO emission factor of power unit m in year y (tCO \/MWh) EL,m,y 2 2\nm = All power units included in Build Margin calculation\ny = Most recent historical year for which power generation data is available (2007)\nAs for the OM the most recent generation information available is for the year 2007. We therefore use\nthis information to calculate the BM. The data sources used in the calculation are also the same as for\ncalculation of the OM.\nCalculation of the CM emissions factor\nAs per equation 13 of the Grid Tool the combined margin (CM) emissions factor is calculated as follows:\n14\n\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-PDD) - Version 03\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board\nWhere:\nEF = Build margin CO emission factor in year y (tCO \/MWh) grid,BM,y 2 2\nEF = Operating margin CO emission factor in year y (tCO \/MWh) grid,OM,y 2 2\nw = Weighting of operating margin emissions factor (%) OM\nw = Weighting of build margin emissions factor (%) BM\nAs per the Grid Tool, a default value of 0.5 for the weighting factors is used to average the OM and the\nBM emissions factors for the first crediting period.\nCalculation of the Baseline\nAs per the Grid Tool, the baseline (in tCO ) is the MWh produced by the project multiplied by the 2\nCombined Margin expressed in tCO \/MWh. 2\nLeakage\nAs specified in paragraph 12 of AMS I.D.\/Version 13, leakage is to be considered when generating\nequipment is transferred from another activity or when existing equipment is transferred to another\nactivity. In the Project, neither of these situations applies, and therefore no leakage source needs to be\nconsidered for this project. The generating equipment is new, and there is no existing equipment that\ncould be transferred to another activity."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

The project will\nincrease carbon sequestration, reverse grassland degradation, contribute to local development\nand preserve cultural traditions.\nAccording to the Project Design Report, Before the implementation of the project, there was severe\ndegradation and desertification of the grasslands in this area due to the impact of climate change\nand human activities, the excellent forages in the plant community almost disappeared, and the\nnatural reproduction and renewal ability was very low.\nThe national standard of China Parameters for Degradation, Sandification and Salification of\nRangelands (GB 19377-2003) specifies indicators for the determination of degradation,\nsandification and salification levels (slight, moderate and severe)15. The project focuses on 332,660\nhectares of moderately or severely degraded grasslands in Fuyun and adopts a combination of the\nfollowing measures:\n\u00b7Grazing prohibition: Grazing prohibited on severely degraded grasslands. This project\nsustainably manages 325,293.3 ha of severely degraded grasslands.\n\u00b7Grass planting: Fencing and planting of native grass species on the moderately degraded\ngrassland, grazing will be prohibited after the completion of grass planting and fence installation.\nThe grass species are Poa crymophila, Elymus nutans, Elymus sibiricus, and Agropyron cristatum.\nThere are 7,366.7 ha of moderately degraded grassland in this project has been sustainably\nmanaged through artificial grass planting and fencing.\nPlease refer to Section 2.1.11 for detailed descriptions.\nThe project is estimated to generate net GHG emission reductions and removals of 22,106,811\ntCO e over the 40-year crediting period, with average net GHG emission reductions and removals 2\nof 552,670 tCO e per year. 2\nBesides these main restoration measures, the project also alleviates soil desertification and\nrestores grassland vegetation to improve soil carbon storage and local biodiversity through\ngrassland management measures, such as daily management measures from other protection\n14 Mu is a unit of land area commonly used in China, equivalent to 1\/15 hectares or 666.7 square meters.\n15 For instance, \u201cdecrease in above-ground grass yield\u201d is one of the indicators that must be measured to determine\nthe degradation level. Indicative values of decrease in above-ground grass yield for non-degraded grassland, slightly\ndegraded grassland, moderately degraded grassland and severely degraded grassland are 0%~10%, 11%~20%,\n21%~50% and > 50%, respectively.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 8\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nprojects like rodent and pest control and grassland fire prevention to ensure the long-term\nsustainable management of the project area.\nThe project is expected to achieve the following climate, community and biodiversity benefits:\n\u00b7 Climate: Restore the degraded grassland ecosystem, increase carbon sequestration and reduce\nGHG emissions.\n\u00b7 Community: Provide temporary and permanent job opportunities that bring income to participants;\nprovide technical training and improve their knowledge and skills in sustainable grassland\nmanagement; preserve the cultural traditions of local Kazakhs and other minority ethnic groups.\n\u00b7 Biodiversity: Increase vegetation cover with native grass species, provide suitable habitats for\nwild animals, and increase local biodiversity."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_state_province': 'Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region', 'project_country': 'China'}"}]}
