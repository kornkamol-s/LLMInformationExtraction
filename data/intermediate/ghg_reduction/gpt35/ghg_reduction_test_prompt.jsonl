Nevertheless, the main steps to implement activities will be: Logistics organization;\nTraining; Site selection; Species selection and seedling preparation; Planting (site preparation,\nplanting, etc.) and Maintenance.\nv3.2 7\n\n\n[['Year', '', 'Estimated', '', '', 'Estimated', '', 'Estimated\\nleakage\\nemissions\\n(tCO e)\\n2', '', 'Estimated net', ''], [None, None, 'baseline', None, None, 'project', None, None, None, 'GHG emission', None], [None, None, 'emissions or', None, None, 'emissions or', None, None, None, 'reductions or', None], [None, None, 'removals', None, None, 'removals', None, None, None, 'removals', None], [None, None, '(tCO e)\\n2', None, None, '(tCO e)\\n2', None, None, None, '(tCO e)\\n2', None], ['2009', '0.00', None, None, '7,388.56', None, None, '0.00', '7,388.56', None, None], ['2010', '0.00', None, None, '27,815.96', None, None, '0.00', '27,815.96', None, None], ['2011', '0.00', None, None, '43,743.33', None, None, '0.00', '43,743.33', None, None], ['2012', '0.00', None, None, '49,757.90', None, None, '0.00', '49,757.90', None, None], ['2013', '0.00', None, None, '50,031.78', None, None, '0.00', '50,031.78', None, None], ['2014', '0.00', None, None, '50,641.98', None, None, '0.00', '50,641.98', None, None], ['2015', '0.00', None, None, '51,824.33', None, None, '0.00', '51,824.33', None, None], ['2016', '0.00', None, None, '53,799.96', None, None, '0.00', '53,799.96', None, None], ['2017', '0.00', None, None, '56,544.60', None, None, '0.00', '56,544.60', None, None]]\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n3.3 Leakage\nThe only leakage emission source considered in the selected methodology is leakage due to the\ndisplacement of agricultural activities, and must be calculated using the tool AR-TOOL1531.\nIn the project area of the first activity instance, as described in sections 1.1, 1.13 and 2.4., there\nwas not any agricultural activity pervious to the project activity.

GHG emissions by sources increased as result of project activity\nGHG emissions as a result of project activities will be calculated according to the\napproved methodology. The project takes into account the increase in emissions of\nGHG gases resulting from use of fossil fuel, biomass loss and the use of fertilizer.\nFossil fuel combustion, for instance, occurs during thinning and harvesting activities,\nbut the methodology excludes transportation fuel.\nwhere:\nGHG Annual GHG emissions as result of the implementation of the A\/R project activity within the E,t project boundary; tonnes CO-e yr-1 in year t 2 E CO emissions from combustion of fossil fuels within the project boundary; tonnes CO-e yr-1 FuelBurn,t 2 2\nin year t\nE GHG emissions from the loss of biomass in site preparation and conversion to A\/R within the BiomassLoss,t project boundary; tonnes CO-e yr-1 in year t 2\nE Non-CO2 emission as a result of biomass burning within the project boundary; tonnes CO-e Non- 2 yr-1 in year t CO2,BiomassBurn,t\nT Ranges from 1 to end of crediting period; years\nThe project participants assume that a small amount of GHG emissions will result\nfrom site preparation and plantation management activities. However, the proposed\nA\/R project activity does not engage in any burning practices during site preparation.\nFurther, conversion of herbaceous vegetation can be neglected, and the loss of GHG\nsequestered in woody biomass will not occur since trees and shrubs will not be\nremoved.\nHowever, for the project participants, it is a difficult task to estimate ex ante GHG\nemissions with a high degree of accuracy. To maintain a conservative approach for\nthe ex-ante calculation, the proposed A\/R project activity applies a default 10%\nproject GHG emission value based on the CO2-e stock in living biomass of trees in\nthe project scenario However, this value will probably be adjusted during the\nverification process.\n103\n\n[['', 'Year of project', '', '', 'Year', '', '', 'GHG\\nE,t', '', '', 'GHG : %139\\nE,t', ''], ['1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30', None, None, '2002\\n2003\\n2004\\n2005\\n2006\\n2007\\n2008\\n2009\\n2010\\n2011\\n2012\\n2013\\n2014\\n2015\\n2016\\n2017\\n2018\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n2023\\n2024\\n2025\\n2026\\n2027\\n2028\\n2029\\n2030\\n2031', None, None, '197\\n1,115\\n2,735\\n4,865\\n7,352\\n10,062\\n13,051\\n16,371\\n19,949\\n23,764\\n28,271\\n34,270\\n42,494\\n53,441\\n67,320\\n83,999\\n103,066\\n123,941\\n145,711\\n167,513\\n166,667\\n187,588\\n205,400\\n219,976\\n238,402\\n247,143\\n252,446\\n263,970\\n278,380\\n265,547', None, None, '10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %', None, None]]\nVCS Project Description Template\nTable 22: Sum of the increases in GHG emissions by sources within the project boundary as a result of\nthe implementation of an A\/R project activity\n4.3.2.

Generally it is assumed that grazing activities\ncontinue to be executed in an extensive manner within the project boundaries and\ncommercial animal farming is not present. Hence, leakage from displacement of\ngrazing activities is considered to be zero:\nFurther, there is no collection of firewood in the baseline scenario of the project area.\nTherefore, this variable is set to zero:\n139 Project emissions are estimated to be a percentage of the estimated accumulated tCO2e sequestered through the\nA\/R project activity.\n104\n\n[['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'C\\nAR', '', '', '\u2206C\\nACTUAL', '', '', '\u2206C\\nBSL', '', '', 'LK', ''], ['Year of project', 'Year of project', None, 'Year', 'Year', None, '', 'Estimation of net', '', '', 'Estimation of', '', '', 'Estimation of', '', 'Estimation of\\nleakage (tCOe)\\n2', 'Estimation of', None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'anthropogenic', None, None, 'actual net GHG', None, None, 'baseline net GHG', None, None, 'leakage (tCOe)\\n2', None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'GHG removals by', None, None, 'removals by sinks', None, None, 'removals by sinks', None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'sinks (tCOe)\\n2', None, None, '(tCOe)\\n2', None, None, '(tCOe)\\n2', None, None, None, None], ['1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30', None, None, '2002\\n2003\\n2004\\n2005\\n2006\\n2007\\n2008\\n2009\\n2010\\n2011\\n2012\\n2013\\n2014\\n2015\\n2016\\n2017\\n2018\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n2023\\n2024\\n2025\\n2026\\n2027\\n2028\\n2029\\n2030\\n2031', None, None, '1,772\\n10,034\\n24,616\\n43,783\\n66,166\\n90,558\\n117,461\\n147,336\\n179,544\\n213,876\\n254,440\\n308,427\\n382,448\\n480,973\\n605,881\\n755,988\\n927,598\\n1,115,469\\n1,311,403\\n1,507,617\\n1,500,001\\n1,688,295\\n1,848,600\\n1,979,780\\n2,145,617\\n2,224,284\\n2,272,014\\n2,375,733\\n2,505,423\\n2,389,921', None, None, '1,772\\n10,034\\n24,616\\n43,783\\n66,166\\n90,558\\n117,461\\n147,336\\n179,544\\n213,876\\n254,440\\n308,427\\n382,448\\n480,973\\n605,881\\n755,988\\n927,598\\n1,115,469\\n1,311,403\\n1,507,617\\n1,500,001\\n1,688,295\\n1,848,600\\n1,979,780\\n2,145,617\\n2,224,284\\n2,272,014\\n2,375,733\\n2,505,423\\n2,389,921', None, None, '0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0', None, None, '0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0', None, None]]\nVCS Project Description Template\nLK =0\nFuelwood\nBased on both contemplations, the A\/R project activity considers leakage to be zero:\nLK =0\n4.4.

As identified by the timber study, the activity-shifting leakage is geographically\nconstrained by proximity to transportation routes and accessibility.\n5.5.1 ESTIMATING EMISSIONS FROM LEAKAGE\nEmissions from leakage are quantified two approaches for the purposes of ex-ante estimates. First, leakage is\nquantified by defining a leakage area and adjusting baseline rates of deforestation and degradation in the leakage\narea using leakage cancellation rates. And second, by making reasonable assumptions about the proportion of\nmerchantable biomass in the project region based on the results of the timber study to apply a conservative\nmarket-effects leakage discount. The first approach is summarized in Section 5.5.2 while the second in Section\n5.5.5. All calculations are provided in VM0006 Accounting ACAPA-BMF v10.15.xlsm.\nFor the purposes of ex-post estimates, the leakage area is monitored for increases in deforestation and\ndegradation relative to predicted baseline levels. The market-effects discount factor is applied until the time of\nbaseline reassessment.\n5.5.2 ESTIMATE LEAKAGE FROM GEOGRAPHICALLY CONSTRAINED DRIVERS\nEx-ante leakage from geographically unconstrained drivers is estimated by estimating the leakage-induced increase\nin deforestation and degradation rates as a result of project activities and then adding this increase to the\npredicted baseline rates of deforestation and degradation for the leakage area. The baseline rates of deforestation\nand degradation are presented in Section 5.3.5 while the leakage-induced increase is described in Section 5.5.2.1.\nv3.0 17 6"}]}

The steps to be followed in the quantification of\nemissions according to the methodology are:\nStep 1: Estimate the amount of biomass removed. Said estimate is made in systems with existing non-woody\nor shrub-like vegetation and for the pasture lands the maximum stock present is considered, in order to be\nconservative. For coffee plantations it is carried out by counting the coffee trees eliminated per tree unit of\nthe tree stand model incorporated.

Leakage\nThe leakage for the monitoring period from November 18th, 2016 to May 14th, 2021 is considered\nzero given the following conditions:\n1. Agricultural baseline: The agricultural activities carried out within the Flor Cue property did not\ncontinue. Additionally, farmers were not affected since they were working in the land under\nleasing contracts and the change of activity took place long after their termination.\n2. Livestock baseline: Emissions leakage attributable to the displacement of grazing activities are\nconsidered insignificant (zero) because the following condition referenced in the tool\n\u201cEstimation of the increase in GHG emissions attributable to displacement of pre-project\nagricultural activities in A\/R CDM project activity\u201d is met:\n\u25cf Animals are displaced to existing grazing land and the total number of animals in the\nreceiving grazing land (displaced and existing) does not exceed the carrying capacity of the\ngrazing land (section 4.3).\n6.5.

According to Candel et al. (2006)43, the carrying capacity in semi-arid tropic regions of India is\nestimated as 1.024 LUs per ha which is slightly higher than the status of LUs per ha in the\nproject. Moreover, this carrying capacity is very conservative for the project area being moist\ntropical condition with significantly higher dry matter production than semi-arid lands.\nTherefore leakage emission attributable to the displacement of grazing activities is considered\ninsignificant in this project.\n3.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\nThe ex-ante net anthropogenic GHG emission reductions and removals are calculated using\nequation 5 of the methodology.

The main emissions potentially giving rise to leakage\nin the context of electric sector projects are emissions arising due to activities such as power\nplant construction and upstream emissions from fossil fuel use (e.g. extraction, processing,\nand transport). These emissions sources are neglected.\n6.5 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\nThe emission reductions estimated in the PDD were 1,428,041 tCO e (727,982 2\ntCO e\/365d*716d) during this monitoring period. The actual emission reductions in this 2\nmonitoring period (716days) were 1,535,574 tCO e, the actual emission reductions in this 2\nmonitoring period are 7.00% more than the estimation in the registered PDD. The higher\nelectricity exported has no impact on the additionally of the project activity as the sensitivity\nanalysis of the project activity shows that the IRR will not exceeds benchmark until an 8.2%\nincrease in Grid-connected electricity.\nv3.1 42"}]}

The thermal energy from the biomass\nsystem displaces thermal energy previously generated for the customers (Lubrizol and Zeon) by\nOxyVinyls, L.P., and subsequently by Recast Energy Louisville, LLC, after the purchase of the\nthermal energy plant from OxyVinyls by way of Lubrizol.\nThe Project Activity consists of converting an existing coal fired boiler built in 1981 to a biomass\nfired boiler that will continue to provide thermal energy to the project customers. The biomass\nboiler will be the predominant thermal energy source for the customers. Supplemental thermal\nenergy will be provided by natural gas boilers during periods when the biomass boiler cannot\nmeet full demand load.\nThe biomass is generated generally within a wood basket that has an abundant supply of\nbiomass feedstock potential. The wood basket encompasses a one hour drive time from the\nproject site (the \u201cTarget Feedstock Area\u201d). On a case by case basis, some biomass may be\nsourced up to two hour drive time. Within the Target Feedstock Area, an estimated 2.743,000\nmillion short tons of green (wet) biomass is generated annually. The project is expected to\nconsume between 75,000 and 100,000 green tons per year based on historical thermal energy\ndemand.\nAside from displacing greenhouse gases from fossil fuels, the project activity also has an\neconomic benefit for the local community. A large portion of the biomass fuel used in the project\nactivity was previously unused and unsellable material, which generally remained in the field and\nforest to decay or was landfilled. As a result of the project activity, the economy of the entire area\nhas benefitted through job creation in the collecting, processing and transport of materials. The\nproject activity creates roughly 30 permanent green collar jobs: 14 in plant and approximately 12\nto 20 upstream in the fuel supply chain.\nAlthough the project activity has the capacity to supply the project customer\u2019s typical annual\nsteam load, the project proponent elects to maintain a natural gas boiler system as redundant\nbackup. When the biomass system is not able to meet the real-time full load, additional load is\nv3.2 5\n\n\n[['COEF\\nDiesel,y', '=', '1.015E-02', 'tCO2e\/gal'], ['LE\\nprocess,y', '=', '38.99', 'tCO2e'], ['', '', '', ''], ['\u03a3(DAF\\nbiomass\\n)\\ndeliveries', '=', '25,000', 'km'], ['COEF\\nDiesel, y', '=', '1.015E-02', 'tCO2e\/gal'], ['EFF\\ntt, y', '=', '9.66', 'km\/gal'], ['LE\\nbiomass transp,y', '=', '26.73', 'tCO2e'], ['', '', '', ''], ['\u03a3(DAF )\\nash delivery', '=', '0', 'km'], ['COEF\\nDiesel, y', '=', '1.015E-02', 'tCO2e\/gal'], ['EFF\\ntt,y', '=', '9.66', 'km\/gal'], ['LE\\nash transp,y', '=', '0', 'tCO2e'], ['', '', '', ''], ['LEL\\nL2,y', '=', '0', 'tCO2e'], ['', '', '', ''], ['LE\\ny', '=', 'LE +\\nbiomass transp,y\\nLE + LE\\nbiomass process,y L2,y\\n+ LE + LE =\\nash transp,y L2,y', '65.72 tCO2e']]\n[['Years', '', 'Estimated', '', '', 'Estimated', '', 'Estimated\\nleakage\\nemissions\\n(tCO2e)', '', 'Estimated net', ''], [None, None, 'baseline', None, None, 'project', None, None, None, 'GHG emission', None], [None, None, 'emissions or', None, None, 'emissions or', None, None, None, 'reductions or', None], [None, None, 'removals', None, None, 'removals', None, None, None, 'removals', None], [None, None, '(tCO2e)', None, None, '(tCO2e)', None, None, None, '(tCO2e)', None], ['2013', '41,250', None, None, '993', None, None, '50', '40,207', None, None], ['2014', '55,000', None, None, '1324', None, None, '66', '53,610', None, None], ['2015', '55,000', None, None, '1324', None, None, '66', '53,610', None, None], ['2016', '55,000', None, None, '1324', None, None, '66', '53,610', None, None], ['2017', '55,000', None, None, '1324', None, None, '66', '53,610', None, None]]\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n3.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\nThe estimated emissions reductions (ERy) are calculated as the difference between the baseline\nemissions and the project emissions and project leakage.

We also established that uncertainty from GHG emissions from peat burning was also zero in\nthe project scenario, as we assumed full fire prevention in the project area. However, we calculated\nuncertainty from GHG emissions from peat burning in the baseline using the dry mass burnt per stratum\nper year and their standard deviations converted to 95% confidence intervals. We combined emissions\ndata from CO2 and CH4 burning to produce an overall uncertainty in CO2 equivalent, because Module X-\nUNC does not distinguish between these emissions.\nWe calculated the uncertainty for WRC as 34.79% and 22.29% for the years 2016 and 2017, respectively\nin the baseline scenario. In the project scenario the uncertainty was calculated as 1.99% and 1.41%, for\n2016 and 2017, respectively.

The project involves construction of a reservoir with an area5 of 18 ha and a power\ndensity of 88.9 W\/m2, accordingly. As the power density of this project is above 10 W\/m2, GHG\nemissions from the reservoir need not to be accounted in the project activity. Thus, this project\nactivity generates GHG emission reductions up to a total expected CO emission reduction of 2\n80,244 tCO over the first crediting period of 2 years and three months 2\nThe project involves the construction of a two-generating unit hydropower plant which has new\nhydro turbines and generators in order to convert potential energy available in the river flow into\nclean electrical energy (without GHG emission) which is supplying to the national grid at the\nconnection point through the transmission line. The power metering systems are installed at the\nconnection point. They are digital and bi-direction type to measure the export and import\nelectricity of Nam Chim 1 hydropower plant.\nThe main equipment utilized in this project was imported from India.

It is assumed that the uncertainties associated with input data are available, either\nas default uncertainty values given in most recent IPCC guidelines, or as statistical estimates based on\nsampling.\nUncertainty at all times is defined at the 95% confidence interval where the estimated variance exceeds\n+\/- 15 percent from the mean. Procedures including stratification and the allocation of sufficient\nmeasurement plots will help ensure that low uncertainty results and ultimately full crediting can result.\nUncertainties arising from the measurement and monitoring of carbon pools and greenhouse gases\nshall always be quantified. Errors in each pool shall be weighted by the size of the pool so that projects\nmay reasonably target a lower precision level in pools that only form a small proportion of the total\nstock.\nFor both the baseline and the with-project case the total uncertainty is equal to the square root of the\nsum of the squares of each component uncertainty and is calculated at the time of reporting through\npropagating the error in the baseline stocks and the error in the project stocks.\nTherefore, total uncertainty for LtPF project is calculated as:\n(29)\nWhere:\nU total uncertainty for LtPF Project, dimensionless; total|LtPF\nU total uncertainty for the improved forest management activities in |PRJ\nthe project scenario, dimensionless; and\n58\nV 4.0"}]}
