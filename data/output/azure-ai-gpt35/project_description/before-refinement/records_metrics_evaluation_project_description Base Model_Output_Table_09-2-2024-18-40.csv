All the steps are explained in the section 3.5 additionality.
3.6 Methodology Deviations
1. Grid emission factor
The methodology refers to CDM Tool 7 for electricity grid emission factor. However, the data is
not available in public domain to calculate the grid emission factor and therefore project owner
is not able to calculate this factor.
The project owner request to use the publicly available grid emission factor for the project,
which will be fix for first crediting period. For future crediting period project owner anticipates
that the data will be available to calculate the grid emission factor and then the Tool 7 or any
other Verra guidance will be used for the project.
Based on publicly available information, the following data is available for UAE grid emission
factor:
The Project will consumed less electricity with respect to the baseline and therefore lower grid
emission factor will result in lower baseline emissions and lower emission reductions and
therefore the lower grid emission factor will be conservative of therefor lower value (IRENA) is
selected. As IRENA value is latest and conservative therefore this has been used for the first
crediting period.

As per the Methodology the default benchmark boundary is a city where the project activity is
located which is Abu Dhabi.
No definition is provided related with the city.
The UAE is divided into seven administrative divisions (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm
Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah), referred as emirates. Each emirates have its own
rules and regulations and clear demarcation of boundary.
ï· Therefore, Abu Dhabi Emirate is considered as city for methodological requirement and
benchmark boundary. As this is grouped project and therefore the boundary is limited
to Abu Dhabi Emirate, United Arab Emirates.
4 QUANTIFICATION OF ESTIMATED GHG
EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND
REMOVALS
4.1 Baseline Emissions
Baseline emissions are estimated using Approach 1 as the benchmark installation is electricity
driven technology.
Total baseline emissions are calculated as follows, using Equation (2) from the methodological
tool 05; Baseline, project and/or leakage emissions from electricity consumption and
monitoring of electricity generation version 3.0. When applying the tool, parameter QB,y shall
correspond to parameter EC whereas BE shall correspond to BE . BL,k,y, y EC,y

Where
BE = Baseline emissions in year y (tCO e/yr) y 2
Q = Estimated electricity consumption of isolated and less efficient air- B,y

TDL = Average technical transmission and distribution losses for providing BY
electricity to the baseline in year y
EF = Grid CO emission factor calculated in accordance with the âTool to EL,y 2

(tCO e/MWh) 2
43","The methodology of this project includes the following:

1. Grid emission factor: The project owner is unable to calculate the grid emission factor using publicly available data. They have requested to use a publicly available grid emission factor for the project, which will be fixed for the first crediting period. For future crediting periods, they anticipate having the data to calculate the grid emission factor and will use Tool 7 or other Verra guidance.

2. Benchmarking Boundary: The default benchmark boundary is the city where the project activity is located, which in this case is Abu Dhabi. The methodology considers Abu Dhabi Emirate as the city for methodological requirements and the benchmark boundary.

3. Baseline Emissions: Baseline emissions are estimated using Approach 1 as the benchmark installation is an electricity-driven technology. The calculation of total baseline emissions involves the use of Equation (1) from methodological tool 05, which includes parameters such as estimated electricity consumption, average technical transmission and distribution losses, and the grid CO2 emission factor.

 109 Increased interest in wind energy proj ects of other clients will further push 
R&D efforts by technology providers to develop more efficient and better 
machinery in future. 
 
â¢ Economic: 
9 The project activity requires tempor ary and permanent, skilled and semi-
skilled manpower at the wind park; this will create additional employment 
opportunities.  
9 The generated electricity will be fed to the regional grid through local grid, 
thereby improving the grid frequency and availability of electricity to the 
local consumers (villagers  & sub-urban habitants) which will provide new 
opportunities for industries and economic activities to be setup in the area 
thereby resulting in greater local empl oyment, ultimately leading to overall 
development.  
 
â¢ Sectoral Scope: 1, â Grid connected renewable electricity generation â  
â¢ Social:  
9 The project activity has led to the de velopment of supporting infrastructure 
such as road network etc., in the wind park location, which also provides 
access to the local population. 
9 The project activity leads to alleviation of poverty by establishing direct and 
indirect benefits through employment generation and improved economic 
activities by strengthening of local gr id of the state electricity utility. 
9 Use of a renewable source of energy reduces the dependence on imported 
fossil fuels and associated price variation thereby leading increased energy 
security. 
 
â¢ Environmental:  
 
9 The project activity involves use of renewable energy source for electricity 
generation instead of fossil fuel based electricity generation which would 
have emitted gaseous, liquid and/or solid effluents/wastes. 
9 Being a renewable resource, using wind energy to generate electricity 
contributes to resource conservation. Thus the project causes no negative 
impact on the surrounding environmen t contributing to environmental well-
being.

1.13 Additional Information Relevant to the Project
Eligibility Criteria
The Project is eligible to be a VCS Project because:
â¢ VCS v.3.3 has taken effect on 04.10.2012, accordingly the Project is eligible to use this version.
â¢ VCS v.3.3requires project crediting period start date earliest to be 01.01.2002, besides, the
Project must also complete the validation within two years of the Project Start Date. Both
conditions are satisfied for the Project activity.
â¢ VCS v.3.3 accepts all six Kyoto gases. The Project Activity aims to reduce CO2, which is one of
these six Kyoto gases.
12 Turkey is a party to UNFCCC and listed in Annex -1, but the Marrakesh Accord at COP 7, âInvites the Parties to recognize
the special circumstances of Turkey, which place Turkey, after becoming a Party, in a situation different from that of other
Parties included inAnnex I to the Convention.â As a result, even though Turkey has ratified Kyoto Protocol, she does not have a
binding target under Annex-B, and as a result Turkey can not host CDM or JI projects.

The project is expected to reduce GHG emissions by replacing continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, this method can reduce the flooded time of rice in the whole growth cycle and the methane (CH4) emissions, and is more beneficial to production increase than the continuously flooded as well. Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the backward continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario.', 'project_state_province': 'Heilongjiang Province', 'project_country': 'China', 'project_latitude': 47.91, 'project_longitude': 133.97}",3,3,5,5,3,0.19,15,Completed,0.017764792433472024,0.5538461538461539,0.1782178217821782,0.2696629213483146,0.125,0.03980099502487562,0.060377358490566045,0.3384615384615385,0.10891089108910891,0.16479400749063672,0.3076923076923077,0.09900990099009901,0.149812734082397

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
Malawi is one of the least developed countries (LDC) and among the poorest nations in the world1, with
a population whose lives and livelihoods are highly dependent on rain-fed agriculture and wood fuel
resources. Malawiâs forest areas have continuously decreased over recent decades2, and its growing
population coupled with the effects of a changing climate further exacerbates the countryâs historical
trend of deforestation and forest degradation. Forest loss in Malawi is a leading cause of soil degradation
and erosion, with cascading negative effects on water and soil nutrient availability that further challenges
smallholder agriculture in the country3, putting much of the populationâs overall resilience at risk.
In an effort to reverse this trend, Ripple Africa and GreenCollar are implementing a grouped afforestation
project in the Northern and Central regions of Malawi. The first activity instance of this grouped project
takes place in the District of Mzimba, with the planting of 1.8 million trees in 2022 and 2023. Subsequent
planting across the districts will be added to the grouped project as new activity instances.
Over 66% of Malawiâs forest area is located in the Northern and Central regions of the country. Malawi is
severely affected by deforestation with a high average annual rate of 1.5% between 2018-2022 and a
16% decrease in tree cover in 2001-20234. Deforestation is driven by the unsustainable and often illegal
collection of wood fuel and encroachment of farmland. The afforestation project will alleviate pressure
on existing forests in the Northern and Central regions of the country and integrate forest regeneration
into local community practices by planting trees on degraded land, fostering forest conservation, building
landholder capacity to manage and maintain planted forests and tree nurseries, and providing alternative
sources of income to the people participating in the program (hereafter, Registered Beneficiaries).
Furthermore, Ripple Africa will use a portion of the funding generated by the project through the sale of
carbon credits for additional activities that will benefit communities. This may include planting community
fruit trees in farms and schools and establishing Forest Conservation Committees to strengthen native
forest protection and regeneration in the region. Fruit tree planting and forest conservation activities will
enhance the positive climate, environmental and socioeconomic impact of the afforestation project but
will not generate additional VCUs for the project.
To implement the project, Ripple Africa has the approval of the Department of Forestry which will support
Ripple Africaâs engagement with local leaders and communities. To ensure the long-term success of the
project activities and the sustained growth of the planted trees, Ripple Africa will sign Tree Planting
Program Landholder Agreements with Registered Beneficiaries participating in the projectâs afforestation
activities. Ripple Africa has been implementing environmental, educational, and healthcare programs in
Malawi for the last 20 years, maintaining a strong local presence, and has prior experience planting trees
in the country.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project and its Implementation Status
The project activity consists of 20 MW biomass-based power Plant at Nimdha (V), Dhenkanal
District, Orissa State. The project activity has been essentially conceived to generate GHG
emission free electricity by making use of available biomass at the project site to supply the
electricity to the grid. The project being a renewable energy project leads to sustainable
development through efficient utilization of available natural resources and generation of
additional employment for the local stakeholders.
The project activity is generation of electricity by utilizing surplus biomass residues like paddy
stalks, ground nut shell, stalks of red grams, mung, til, maize etc. agro industrial waste (rice
husk) and woody biomass (juliflora & casuarina twigs, etc) from agricultural/waste lands,
which are available in the project region and exporting the generated electricity to the grid
system owned by Orissa Power Transmission Corporation Limited (OPTCL), a state utility
which is part of grid.
As the project activities utilize naturally available Biomass project for power generation and do
not use any fossil fuels, the project contributes for reduction of greenhouse gases, which
would have, otherwise, been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants
and/or by addition of new generation sources.
Objective of the Project
The installations of the project activities have been carried out with a motive of generation of
electricity from environmentally benign source of energy. The project activity comprises of
biomass plant. The details of the investor along with the unique identification of the Plant have
been provided in Section A.4.2.
Nature of the Project
The basic technology involved in the project is is generating electricity using biomass
(agricultural residues) with a 90 TPH biomass fired boiler (BFBC) using a 23 MW turbine
whose capacity will be governed at 20MW. On an annual average basis, the project exports
around 124.57 GWh to the OPTCL grid, which is belongs to eastern grid, which is a part of the
NEWNE grid1. Considering auxiliary power consumption of 10 % the plant is expected to
operate at an annual average plant load factor of 80%.

JOINT PROJECT DESCRIPTION & MONITORING REPORT: VCS Version 3
The PP of SGEL has entered into a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with state
utility for a period of 20 years from the date of implementation of project.
Scenario existing prior to the implementation of project activity:
The scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project activity, is electricity delivered
to the grid by the project activity that would have otherwise been generated by the operation of
grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as reflected in the
combined margin (CM) calculations described in the âTool to calculate the emission factor for
an electricity systemâ.
Baseline Scenario:
As per the applicable methodology, a Greenfield power plant is defined as âa new renewable
energy power plant that is constructed and operated at a site where no renewable energy
power plant was operated prior to the implementation of the project activityâ.
As the project activity falls under the definition of a Greenfield power plant, the baseline
scenario as per paragraph 24 of Section 5.2.1 of applied methodology is the following:
If the project activity is the installation of a Greenfield power plant, the baseline scenario is
electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by
the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources,
as reflected in the combined margin (CM) calculations described in the âTool to calculate the
emission factor for an electricity systemâ.
Hence, pre-project scenario and baseline scenario are the same.
Contribution to GHG emissions reduction
The project activity harnesses wind energy to generate and supply electricity to the Indian
grid. The Project displaces fossil fuel-based electricity generation that would have otherwise
been provided by the operation and expansion of the fossil fuel-based power plants in regional
electricity grid, thereby leading to reduction in emission of greenhouse gases associated with
fossil fuel-based electricity generation.
As a result, GHG emission reductions by project is estimated to be approximately 104,744
tCO2e per year and total GHG emission reductions of 626,971 tCO2e for the crediting period,
thereon displacing 746,395 MWh/year amount of electricity from the gird.
The project is already registered with UNFCCC CDM (UN ref. no. 59052) on 18 Jul 2012 with
fixed crediting period 18 Jul 12 - 17 Jul 22.

PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The SuÅehri HPP facilities are developed and owned by YPM Elektrik Ãretim A.Å. in the districts
of SuÅehri of Sivas province, Central Anatolia and has achieved all the necessary licenses to
implement the project. The purpose of the project activity is to generate electricity from renewable
sources and to sell it to the National Grid.
The electricity generation license consists of five HPPs; GÃ¶lova, Sevindik, Konak, BeypÄ±narÄ± and
AltÄ±ntepe with total installed capacities of 19 MW.
First Konak HPP, BeypÄ±narÄ± HPP and AltÄ±ntepe HPP was constructed and are under operation
since 2007. The other two, GÃ¶lova and Sevindik HPPs which were built and are operational since
2009 with installed capacities 1.05 MWm and 5.714 MWm respectively are the only project
activity of this PDD according to the Turbine Purchase Agreement1. The license2 is issued by
EMRA with installed capacities 1.05MWm for GÃ¶lova HPP and 6.30 MWm for Sevindik HPP. The
difference is due to the license application which was for 1.05 MWm for GÃ¶lova and 6.30 MWm
for Sevindik and the license was issued accordingly after the Turbine Purchase Agreement with
Kossler, Kossler team has conducted a research on the site for the appropriate installed capacity
and decided their only suitable equipment for the flow rate are 1.05MWm for GÃ¶lova and
5.714MWm Sevindik. Also, the FSR statement is prepared with 1.00 MWe and 5.28 MWe of
installed capacities for GÃ¶lova and Sevindik respectively. Therefore, the EIA Exemption Letter3 is
prepared indicating as the FSR states. Since the licensing procedure went on with 1.05 MWm
and 6.30 MWm for GÃ¶lova and Sevindik respectively and there are not any appeals from the
Ministry of Energy and Natural resources, there is not any situation that opposes the regulations.
The total installed capacity of the Project Activity is 6.764 MWm where GÃ¶lova HPP is 1.05 MWm
while Sevindik HPP is 5.714 MWm with gross electricity productions of 4.78GWh and 32.47GWh
respectively. The total gross electricity production of the project activity is 37.25 GWh per year4.
As calculated in the Feasibility Study Report, the line losses and the internal consumption of the
generated electricity is 0.64% and results in 37.01 GWh net electricity supply to the National
Grid5. The total 37.01 GWh of the net electricity generation of the project activity is divided as
4.75 GWh net electricity generation for GÃ¶lova HPP and 32.26 GWh net electricity generation for
Sevindik HPP.
The Project Activity is located on the irrigation canals of GÃ¶lova Dam and could only start
operation after the rehabilitation of the irrigation canals and the reparation of the cracks on the
canal walls which decrease water flow due to water losses. Although the Project Activity and the
GÃ¶lova Dam are under different managements, the Project Activity uses the GÃ¶lova Dam as
reservoir.
The Project Activity will not produce any Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions during the operation.
The electricity generated by the Project Activity can displace part of the power from the fossil fuel

The purpose of the Project is to use well established wind power generation technology for electricity
generation and transmission to generate low emissions electricity for the Grid thereby displacing CO 2
emissions from electricity generation from the Grid. The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario
existing prior to the start of the implementation of the project activity: electricity delivered to the Grid by
the project would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by
the addition of new generation sources. The Grid includes the Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong
and Inner Mongolia Provincial Power Grids.
The proposed project involves the installation of 66 wind turbines each of which with a rated capacity of
750kW, providing a total capacity of 49.5MW. The expected annual electricity supply to the grid is
119,226MWh. The height of the rotor hub of all turbines is 60m. As the wind resource in the area is
plentiful, and the average wind speed is relatively high, averaging7.9m/s at a height of 55m and 8.1m/s at
a height of 65m, the wind resources are sufficient to run a wind farm at the location.
The construction includes a 220kV step-up substation. The wind power to be generated will be delivered
to the 220kV step-up substation by 35kV transmission lines. The electricity will be delivered from the
220kV step-up substation to the existing Huitengliang 220kV transformer substation. From the 220 kV
substation the electricity generated will be transmitted to the Inner Mongolia Power Grid.
Details on the monitoring equipments and their location are given in section B.7.2. of the PDD.","Project Summary: The project involves the installation of 66 wind turbines with a total capacity of 49.5MW.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittently flooded conditions during rice
cultivation is conducted in the north of Qujing City, Yunnan Province, China, with a total acreage
of 12,106 ha of double-cropping rice. Without the project, there would be no ditches, pumps,
valves, and reservoirs to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously
flooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was cultivated by the
continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under
flooded conditions can emit a large amount of methane because of anaerobic decomposition,
the intermittently flooded method is more conducive to saving water, increasing rice yield, and
reducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.
The implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir
construction, pumps and valves installation, training, etc. According to the needs of rice growth,
farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water
resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic
conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice
paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in
the rainy season. In this case, the methane emission can be declined by an average of 48%.
Hence, with the proposed project activity, the estimated GHG reduction from rice is 4.93
tCO e/ha. 2
The project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions by 418,012 tCO e in the first seven-year 2
period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 59,716 tCO e. The project aims to 2
reduce GHG and mitigate climate changes, increase rice productivity resulting in higher living
standards for local farmers and provide more job opportunities.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
This project is categorized as sectoral scope 14 (AFOLU) under Verra as justified in Section 1.3,
although the AMS-III.AU methodology applied is approved under sectoral scope 15 (Agriculture)
of CDM.
The project is developed under VCS scope 14 âAgriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)â
with an activity category of Improved Cropland Management (ICM) under Agricultural Land
Management (ALM).

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittently flooded conditions during rice
cultivation is conducted in Bijie City, Guizhou Province, China, with a total acreage of 19,213 ha
for single-cropping rice. Without the project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently
flooded method, the traditional continuously flooded method would be continued, so the
scenario that rice was cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario.
Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded conditions can emit a large amount of
methane because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittently flooded method is more
beneficial to water conservation, production increase, and less methane emission reduction than
the continuously flooded.
The implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir
construction, pumps and valves installation, training, etc. According to the needs of rice growth,
farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water
resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic
conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice
paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in
the rainy season. In this case, the methane emission can be declined by an average of 48%.
Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction of
3.09 tCO e/ha for rice. 2
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to
416,115 tCO e in the first seven-year period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 2
59,445 tCO e. The project aims to Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes, 2
increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standards of local farmers and provide

What is the methodology of this project?,"

VCS Project Description
â¢ The project activity contributes to economic sustainability around the plant site and encourages
economic power decentralization.
Environmental well-being:
â¢ The project utilizes hydropower to generate electricity, which otherwise would have been
generated through fuel- (most likely fossil-fuel-) based power plants. This way it is
contributing to a reduction in specific emissions (emissions of pollutant/unit of energy
generated), including GHG emissions.
â¢ As hydroelectric power projects produce no end-products in the form of solid waste (ash, etc.),
they donât have to cope with the problem of solid waste disposal encountered by most other
sources of power.
â¢ Being a renewable energy source, hydro energy is used to generate electricity that contributes
to resource conservation.
â¢ Thus, the project causes no negative impact on the surrounding environment; and in the end
contributes to environmental well being due to the run-off river type of project activity.
Technological well being:
â¢ The project supports high quality equipment transfer from other regions and even other
countries, and contributes to capacity building of the labor force through training and practical
work.
â¢ The project promotes local products developed in the region, when replacement of spare parts
is necessary, and supports renewable technology development especially for hydroelectric
power technology.
In view of the above explanation, the project participants consider the project activity as
profoundly contributing to sustainable development.

2.1 Title and reference of the VCS methodology applied
to the project activity and explanation of methodology
choices:
! Category AMS-I.E: Switch from NonâRenewable Biomass for Thermal
Applications by the User â Version 01 from February 01 of 2008 onwards.
The amount of non-renewable biomass (B ) will be determined according to the y
option âbâ of the applied methodology once option âaâ is designed for really
small appliances like household stoves and does not fit for the kind of
projects in question.
The projectâs emissions from the combustion of native wood are accounted in
the same way as fossil fuel combustion, once it is not renewable and emits
CO . 2
2.2 Justification of the choice of the methodology and
why it is applicable to the project activity:
The methodology applied is Category AMS-I.E: Switch from NonâRenewable
Biomass for Thermal Applications by the User â Version 01 from February 01 of
2008 onwards which is applicable for project activities that avoid greenhouse
gas emissions by using renewable biomass in order to generate thermal energy.
This category comprises small thermal appliances that displace the use of
non-renewable biomass by introducing new renewable energy end-user
technologies. The end-user technology in the case of this project can be
established as the project proponent, who utilizes the thermal energy
generated by the new renewable energy technology.
There are no similar registered small-scale CDM project activities in the
region of Presidente Prudente once Social Carbon Company made a research and
did not find any registered smallâscale CDM Project activity in the region.
The sources of registered small-scale CDM project activity consulted were the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 14 and
Brazilianâs Technology and Science Ministry15. Therefore, the proposed project
activity is not saving the non-renewable biomass accounted by the other
registered project activities.
The utilization of firewood from area without any kind of management can not
be considered a renewable source of biomass, since it involves a decrease of
carbon pools and increases the carbon emissions to the atmosphere, turning
green house effect even worse. Moreover, the native wood provided from areas
without a reforestation management plan does not fit any of the options of
UNFCCC definition of renewable biomass in Annex 18, EB 23.
Furthermore, firewood has been used for many decades as fuel in Brazil16.
Although, it is impossible to define a start date on which this kind of non-
renewable biomass began to be applied, there are many documents to prove that
wood has been used for thermal energy generation before 1989 as requested in
the applied methodology. Firewood used to be the most employed source of
primary energy until de decade of 1970, when the petroleum started to supply

Nascente Ceramic VCS Project Description
the majority of Brazilianâs energy needs17. Moreover the Brazilianâs Energy
and Mine Ministry has been monitoring every energetic sectors of Brazil since
1970, and firewood appears over the years monitored as a significant source
of thermal energy for ceramic sector18. Especially in the ceramic sector, the
use of firewood is visible non-renewable and unsustainable, involving
negative environmental impacts associated19.
This way, it can be concluded that non-renewable biomass has been used since
31 December 1989.
The biomasses utilized in the project, sawdust and sugar cane bagasse, are
common residue in the region generated.
Sawdust, wood chips, peanut shells and sugar cane bagasse are all industries
residues coming from large scale reforestation or agroindustrial projects, so
it is considered renewable according to option V of methodology definition of
renewable biomass: âThe biomass is the non-fossil fraction of an industrial
or municipal wasteâ.
The elephant grass is considered renewable according to option III, as soon
as it fits all the assumptions below:
âThe biomass is non-woody biomass and originates from croplands and/or
grasslands where:
(a) The land area remains cropland and/or grasslands or is reverted to
forest; and
(b) Sustainable management practices are undertaken on these land areas to
ensure in particular that the level of carbon stocks on these land areas does
not systematically decrease over time (carbon stocks may temporarily decrease
due to harvesting); and
(c) Any national or regional forestry, agriculture and nature conservation
regulations are complied with.â
Moreover, the project activity will annually generate less than 45 MWThermal.
2.3 Identifying GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs for
the baseline scenario and for the project:
According to the applied methodology, the project boundaries for the project
are the physical, geographical areas of the use of biomass or the renewable
energy, thus, the ceramic limits.
In the baseline scenario, there is use of non-renewable biomass to burn
ceramic devices in the ceramicâs kilns. This practice is responsible to
discharge in the atmosphere the carbon that was stored inside of the wood
(well-known by a carbon sink).

Contribution towards sustainable development:
The project activity being a renewable source of power
generation does not result in any depletion of natural
resources nor does it contribute towards polluting the
environment. The specific benefits of the project
activity are as follows:
Contribution of project to Economic well being:
- The investment in the project will have a positive
effect on the infrastructure of the region, by
bringing about improvements in infrastructure of the
region where the project activity is being
implemented. For instance, the communications and
road network needed by the project activity resulted
in significant improvements in the communications
and road network in the region. Similarly, with the
power from the project needing evacuation to the
grid, the grid connectivity in the region was
improved as a direct result of the project activity.
- The project activity would lead to employment
generation during the time of construction and
subsequently during operation.

Step 4. Common practice analysis 
 
Sub-step 4a. Analyze other activities similar to the proposed project activity: 
 
The biomass produced by the forestry industry is on e of the non-conventional renewable energy sources 
used in Chile (a share of 14 % of the national ener gy pool), and is mainly represented by wood, whose 
consumption is up to 12 millions of m3, which is most provided by natural forests.  However, with an 
increasing trend, the waste from the lumber indus try based on plantations is being progressively 
incorporated like a source to supply energy needs of this same industry2. 
 Nevertheless, despite the increasing utilization in the lumber industry, making use of waste of the forestry activities as a fuel to generate heat or electri city is not a common practice amongst the fishery 
manufacturing and processing.  This fact is supported because the most of fishery industries operating in 
Chile are using fossil fuel technologies in order to cover their needs of steam, heat and electricity.  The following table shows some examples of the fishery or food companies and some features of their boilers 
to meet energy requirements.  These facilities are mainly located within Region X and IX: 
 
Company name Fuel Boiler capacity and 
units number

Salmon Oil Coal 10 [4] In operation 
Agrosuper Coal 2 [1] In operation

Conservas y congelados Fuel Oil NÂº6 not available In operation 
Gelimar Wood not available In operation 
* This table was prepared based on a personal communication of  Mr. DarÃ­o Vicencio, Expert in certification of boilers, Independent 
Consultant. 
 Besides these companies, there are others those have developed energy projects based on biomass during last years.  These projects, however, have incorpor ated the CDM component to their development; these 
initiatives are:  (i) Russfin Biomass CHP Plant Project , (ii) Trupan Biomass Power Plant in Chile, (iii) 
Nueva Aldea Biomass Power Plant Phase 1 and Phase II.  Nevertheless, these are slightly different from 
Panitao Biomass Thermal Energy Project, because in this  case the biomass will be used only to generate 
steam (heat), meanwhile the CDM projects are cogenera ting heat and electricity based in by-products of 
the lumber industry.

2.2 Applicability of Methodology
The consolidated methodology ACM0002 version 18.1 is applicable to grid-connected renewable
power generation projects that:
a. Install a Greenfield power plant;
b. Involve a capacity addition to existing plants;
c. Involve a retrofit of (an) existing plant(s)/unit(s); or
d. Involve a rehabilitation of (an) existing plant(s)/unit(s);
e. Involve a replacement of (an) existing plant(s)/unit(s).
As the project corresponds to the installation of a new power plant at a site where a renewable
power plant has not been operated (Greenfield power plant), the project fulfils condition a);
therefore, consolidated methodology ACM0002 is the most appropriate methodology for the
project. In addition, the methodology is applicable under the following conditions:

The Hornitos Hydroelectric Project is located near Los Andes city. This is approximately 100 km
northeast from Santiago (capital of the country). The hydro power plant will be located in a small valley
surrounded by mountains (Aconcagua Valley). The Hornitos Hydroelectric Project power plant is in
cascade with three other existing downstream hydropower plants (Aconcagua of 72 MW, Los Quilos of
39 MW and Chacabuquito 26 MW).
The international road Ch-60 from Los Andes to Mendoza is the main access road to the project.
Secondary and rural roads connect settlements and camps along that highway. There is little population in
the project area, which is mostly a mountain area.

Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.2
1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
Aurum Sustainable Forest Inc (Aurum) is developing a forest carbon credit project to generate
greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and removals by extending the rotation age of their
operational forests. In addition to increasing the age of their forestlands, the Goldbeck Forest Carbon
Project (Goldbeck) will be reverting stand compositions back to natural longleaf pine forests where
appropriate. The carbon credit project will be implemented following the Verified Carbon Standard
(VCS) VM0003 â Methodology for Improved Forest Management Through Extension of Rotation Age
(IFM ERA).
Project instances will be implemented in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia; of the United States. The current project instance is
approximately 4,140 ha and is composed of non-contiguous parcels. The project has been designed as
a grouped project to allow for additional project activity instances to be added in the future. Additional
project activity instances implemented will be within a similar geographic area, allowing for the use of
the initial project baseline scenario for additionality purposes.
All activity instances included in the project are currently managed for timber harvest, and all forests
within the project activity instances are Forest Stewardship CouncilÂ® (FSCÂ®) certified, meeting the
VM0003 methodology requirement. Implementation of the project activity will result in the removal of
an estimated annual average of 309,030 tCO2e and total of 9,270,890 tCO2e over the 30-year project
period.
The project is currently under development. Monitoring results may impact the greenhouse gas
emissions reductions results that are currently presented in this version.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
Sectoral Scope 14
Improved Forest Management (IFM)

baseline scenario was established using the existing forest management plan and management regime
for the project area. The baseline scenario and additionality assessments have been completed within
a defined geographic area. The project is composed of multiple project activity instances that will be
implemented under the VM0003 methodology. The baseline scenario has been determined for one
geographic area, and the same baseline scenario and geographic area will be used for additional
project activity instances which may occur following project validation.
Eligibility Criteria
Inclusion of additional activity instances will satisfy the following eligibility criteria:
1. Additional instances must satisfy the applicability conditions defined in the most recent
version of the VM0003 VCS Methodology for Improved Forest Management Through
Extension of Rotation Age (IFM ERA).
2. The project activity instance must use technologies or measures used in this document and
must satisfy all conditions of the selected methodology.

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
Site preparation will be carried out in accordance with the technical guidelines and procedures given
by the Ministry of Agriculture Development17.
As no, or very low pre-existing vegetation is present within project boundary (GIOES & APOR, 2006),
site preparation will only consist in punctual soil preparation before tree plantation. Soil preparation
consists in building anti-erosion constructions with the aim to limit wind erosion and retain water down
trees. These constructions are called âhalf-moonâ in accordance with their geometric form (see Figure
10 below).
Figure 10. âhalf-moonâ anti-erosion work (Photo: T.Dufour)
Depending on tree planting density, the area of soil disturbed by half-moon construction was estimated
between 2% and 3.5% of the project area.

1.13 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
Intermittent flooded water regime requires that irrigation and drainage can be controlled
according to the growth needs of rice during its cultivation. However, prior to the project initiation,
economic conditions in the project area are not very good and farmersâ income was low, which
resulted in that the farmers in the project area had no extra money to build the cement ditches,
ponds and other infrastructure for intermittent irrigation. In addition, farmers in the project area
have low education level, so they lack intermittent irrigation technology. So, the project has not
been implemented to generate GHG emissions for the purpose of their subsequent reduction,
removal or destruction. Since the conditions existing prior to the project initiation is the same as
baseline scenario, please refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario) to see the detail information.
Besides, this project does not affect the environmental conditions, including climate, hydrology,
topography, soils, relevant historical conditions, type of vegetation, ecosystems, etc., so, the
present and prior environmental conditions of this project are the same, which are listed as
follows.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1. Timber harvesting and tree removals: This may include thinning, group or individual tree
selective harvest, salvage, and/or other forest management strategies. These activities
will typically be implemented to restore or enhance natural forest composition and
structure, create or accelerate future forest or ecosystem features and development,
and/or to mitigate or manage forest health, fire, or forest disturbance risks or events,
and/or for other ecosystem-based objectives.
2. Access development: The project will manage road development and access at a
property level with an objective of limiting road development while allowing access for
project activities including road maintenance, forest management, forest health and fire
management, recreational access and/or other access requirements.
3. Tree planting or other silvicultural activities to improve and/or accelerate ecological
function and forest ecological development towards desired future conditions.
Other project activities that will not materially affect carbon stocks include:
1. Monitoring â monitoring is primarily undertaken using a combination of site supervision,
remote sensing, and the establishment and measurement of non-destructive permanent
sample plots.
2. Recreational Access Development â DNRP manages the installation and maintenance of
trails for non-motorized recreational access. This activity may involve limited single tree
removals, hazard tree or other safety removals, and/or other limited management
activities related to public hiking and access that are anticipated to have a de minimis
impact on carbon stocks across the project.
Project activities on King County properties are planned and managed by DNRP Parks Division
staff, with input and technical support from other divisions. Participating 3rd Party Landowners will
plan project activities in conjunction with DNRP forestry staff in the Water and Land Resources
Division and 3rd party consultants under the terms of the Participation Agreement each 3rd Party
Landowner has entered into. As sole Project Proponent, DNRP is the sole contact for the project

1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
Generally, most rural forested private lands in King County are either managed for timber
production or for rural residential acreages. Properties managed for timber can have a variety of
management activities and intensities, but predominantly forests are clearcut at age ~40 years old
and then replanted to conifer. Outside of protected private land, most forests have been heavily cut
and regenerated one or more times since the late 1800s. Most managed properties undergo
additional silvicultural activities including a pre-commercial thin, hardwood management, and fill
planting understocked areas, etc. The general objective is fast timber growth to reduce rotation
ages and maximize financial returns. The forest industry is large and well established throughout
most of Washington State and King County.
v3.3 9","Project Summary: The project involves timber harvesting and tree removals, access development, and tree planting or other silvicultural activities. The project aims to restore or enhance natural forest composition and structure, create or accelerate forest or ecosystem features, mitigate forest health and fire risks, and improve ecological function and forest development.

In response to these adverse threats to the eco-region the Oromia Regional Government has attempted to
take concrete actions in recent years through policy and institutional development reforms. Establishment of
Oromia Forest and Wildlife Enterprise (OFWE) is one of these concrete actions taken. However, capacity
and resources are still major limiting factors for OFWE to achieve significant outcome in improved
management of the forests and associated natural resources in the eco-region. This BMERP is designed to
create a sustainable financing mechanism to help government and local communities build capacity and fill
critical resource gaps to bring meaningful changes in the management of natural resources and forests in
the eco-region.
The BMERP will build itself on works under implementation in the eco-region. From 2007 - 2012, Farm
Africa/ SOS Sahel Ethiopia in partnership with the Oromia Forest and Wildlife Enterprise implemented the
Bale Eco-Region Sustainable Management Programme (BERSMP), supported by the Netherlands,
Norwegian and Irish Embassies in Ethiopia. The programme aimed to contribute to the conservation and
sustainable development of the unique biodiversity and ecological functions of the greater Bale Mountains
Eco-region, whilst establishing and enhancing sustainable local livelihoods. The idea was to involve local
communities into a central role in the sustainable management of the area, and as the natural resource
management leaders, supported by government services, across the whole Bale Massif. The Bale
Mountains Eco-Region REDD+ initiative started as part of the bigger programme to address the financial
sustainability of the programme.
Figure 13. Agricultural frontiers expansion into moist forest of Harenna, Bale Eco-Region
There has been little active or effective management of natural resources in the area. Unsustainable
exploitation and degradation throughout the eco-region is increasingly threatening the natural resources
thereby the livelihoods of the local people that directly dependent on them as well as the very survival of a
unique biodiversity resources whose economic potential as a basis for tourism in particular remains
unfulfilled. Under business as usual, the3 eco-region will be on the verge of significant degradation
threatening not only the unique biodiversity of the area but livelihoods of millions of community that directly
and indirectly depend on goods and services from the eco-region. Action should be taken urgently to save
this globally important ecosystem.
1.4 Project Proponent G1.1
The BMERP proponent is the Oromia Forest and Wildlife Enterprise (OFWE), an autonomous fully
government-owned enterprise, established with regulation number 122/2009 issued in July 2009 by the
Oromia State Council under the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. The Oromia Forest and Wildlife
Enterprise owns concession for all of the forests and regionally administered wildlife related conservation
area in Oromia State. The concession area of OFWE covers a total of 367,700 Km2.
OFWEâs mission is to undertake conservation, sustainable development and utilization of the forest and
wildlife resources in its concessions through community participation; ensure supply of forest products
markets and services to domestic and international markets by enhancing forest industry; and subsequently
contribute to the regional and national socio-economic development endeavours.
33

The project proponent, OFWE, is currently responsible for the management of all forests in Oromia regional
state of Ethiopia. The forests were given to OFWE by concession to administer and manage it. OFWE has 9
branch enterprises, where Bale Mountains REDD+ mountains REDD+ project fall in two of the forest
enterprises: Arsi and Bale branches. The two branch enterprises with the OFWE headquarter support will be
responsible for the implementation of the BMERP.
In line with this they will perform the following:
ï· developing work plans and budgets
ï· implementation of activities such as law enforcement, community nursery establishment and
management
ï· support community forest management groups in the implementation of participatory forest
management
ï· closely work with legal bodies to enforce law
ï· ensure participation of other government agencies such as the office of agriculture, energy, etc in
the project implementation
ï· coordination of involvement of non-governmental organizations
OFWE staff profile:
OFWE has a total of3543 staffs working in the different branch offices and districts, out of which 117 staffs
are directly related to the Bale Eco-Region. These are working in two of the branch offices in Bale and West
Arsi within which the Bale eco-region forests fall.
Besides their professional background and skill in forest and biodiversity management the Bale REDD+
project has also provided series of training to build the capacity of the OFWE in REDD+ project management
and implementation. The Bale and Arsi branch office OPFWE staff were the one that conducted the forest
inventory work for the development of this PDD as well.
The Bale REDD+ piloting project (2012-2015) has also developed and is implementing Government and
Community staff capacity building plan (Government and community capacity building plan supplementary
material 25).
Farm Africa and SOS Sahel-Ethiopia, who supported OFWE in the development of the Bale REDD+ pilot
project and this PDD are also supporting the proponent in implementing the project activities until 2015, and
beyond through their current projects such as Bale REDD+ pilot project and SHARE projects (additional
documents enclosed as references). This will also strengthen the proponent in developing additional
capacity.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice
cultivation is conducted in Hulin within Jixi City, Heilongjiang Province of China, with a total
acreage of 20,206 ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project,
which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded
method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded
method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition
can emit a large amount of methane (CH ) because of anaerobic decomposition, the 4
intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase
and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.
This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results
in not only large amount of methane (CH ) emissions but also low rice productivity by 4
replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens
the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH emission 4
can be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an
estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 2.92 tCO e/ha for single-cropping rice is 2
expected.
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to
413,462 tCO e in the first 7 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 2
59,066tCO e. 2
This project aims to:
- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;
- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;
- Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers.

VCS Project Description
availability, climatic factors etc., the capacity utilized is less than best case scenario. Even though wind
farm developers promise about 25-30% of CUF per WTG during a year, this much generation is always
questionable. Effective CUF depends upon the availability of the wind and is not under the control of
supplier or owner of the WEGs. Depending upon the pattern, the CUF is estimated. Hence, there is always
a chance for fluctuation in CUF which would affect the production of electricity and in turn the associated
returns from the wind farm.
1.12 Demonstration to confirm that the project was not
implemented to create GHG emissions primarily for the purpose
of its subsequent removal or destruction.
The project activity is a Greenfield project activity. It is a wind power project activity with a totalled
installed capacity of 8.25 MW and is expected to generate 19152 MWh per annum. The Wind Energy is a
renewable energy source and hence the GHG emissions due to the electricity generation from the WTGs
are Zero. Hence, it is confirmed that the project was not implemented to create GHG emissions primarily
for the purpose of its subsequent removal or destruction.
1.13 Demonstration that the project has not created another form
of environmental credit (for example renewable energy
certificates).
Project Proponent, Savita Oil Technologies has not created GHG emission reduction or removal credits
through any other GHG Program for any form of environmental credit for the period (Monitoring Period)
which will be accounted under VCS. A letter of undertaking from the PP has been provided to validator for
the same.
Since the project proponent has applied for registration under the CDM process of UNFCCC, the GHG
reduction credit would be claimed up to the date of Registration of project activity in CDM to avoid double
counting with CDM.
1.14 Project rejected under other GHG programs (if applicable):
The present project activity is not rejected in any other GHG program.

VCS Project Description
For the implementation of the project, the project proponent has obtained land lease
deeds/sale deeds and has secured nodal agency clearance for commissioning of the WEGs in
the state of Gujarat. The project proponent has entered into the long term power purchase
agreement with the distribution utility for sale of power.
1.11 Identification of risks that may substantially affect the projectâs GHG emission
reductions or removal enhancements
The risks that may affect the projectâs GHG emission reductions are given below:
A. Wind electricity generation is risky and unpredictable due to the variability involved in
wind resources as well as its forecasting. This variability is due to the variability in the
wind speed and wind pattern, which in turn depends on weather cycle, climatic
conditions, etc.
B. The project is dependent on the utility provider for grid availability. If there is a grid
failure, the project will be unable to supply the generated electricity to the grid.
1.12 Demonstration to confirm that the project was not implemented to create GHG
emissions primarily for the purpose of its subsequent removal or destruction.
The project activity is primarily a renewable power generation facility which does not
produce any GHG emissions. The project activity has not been implemented to create GHG
emissions for the purpose of the subsequent removal or destruction of GHG emissions.

September 1997 linking them to the prices of international fuel oils (FO) with
the linkage progressively increasing to 55%, 65% and 75% during the years
1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 respectively for general consumers. On May
27, 2005, Government hiked the price of natural gas supplied to Power and
Fertilizer sectors to Rs.3200 from Rs.2850 per thousand standard cubic
meters. At present, the gas for domestic use, Fertilizer and Power sectors are
still under APM. Once the APM is dismantled, which is likely to happen any
time, the price would go up4. In the above background, it is evident that the
cost of power generation is likely to go up. This is one of the key risk factor
affecting the project GHG emission reductions.
1.12 Demonstration to confirm that the project was not implemented to
create GHG emissions primarily for the purpose of its subsequent
removal or destruction.
The main purpose of the project activity is to generate electricity by utilising
the available gas in the Ramanathapuram ONGC zone. This leads to reduction
GHG emissions in the whole power generation process of the project activity.
Hence it is demonstrated that the project is not implemented to create GHG
emissions primarily for the purpose of its subsequent removal or destruction.
1.13 Demonstration that the project has not created another form of
environmental credit (for example renewable energy certificates).
If the project has created another form of environmental credit, the proponent must provide a letter from the program
operator that the credit has not been used and has been cancelled from the relevant program.
The project activity does not call for another environmental credit or not taken
under any other renewable energy certification. Hence the project activity has
not created another form of environmental credit.
1.14 Project rejected under other GHG programs (if applicable):
Projects rejected by other GHG programs, due to procedural or eligibility requirements where the GHG program
applied have been approved by the VCS Board; can be considered for VCU but project proponents for such a project
shall:
â¢ clearly state in its VCS PD all GHG programs for which the project has applied for credits and why the project
was rejected, such information shall not be deemed commercially sensitive information; and
â¢ provide the VCS verifier and Registry with the actual rejection document(s) including explanation; and
â¢ have the project validated against VCS program requirements.
The project activity is not applied for any other form of credits. Hence, the
rejection by other GHG programs is not applicable.
1.15 Project proponents roles and responsibilities, including contact
information of the project proponent, other project participants:
Project proponent: Penna Electricity Limited.
4 Presently, ONGC charges Rs.6740 for thousand standard cubic meters of gas supplied to sectors other than power and
fertilizers (Financial Express May 28, 2005). This is the price, which ONGC is likely to charge, once the APM is dismantled.

2.1 Project Goals, Design and Long-Term Viability
2.1.1 Summary Description of the Project (G1.2)
Tibet Ngari Improved Grassland Management Project (hereafter as âthe projectâ) is located in
Ngari Region, Tibet Autonomous Region, China. Ngari is located in the southwest border of
China, the west of Tibet Autonomous Region and the north of Qinghai Tibet Plateau (Qiangtang
plateau). The objective of the project is to restore the ""black soil beach14"" and degraded
grassland ecosystem through reseeding native grasses and grazing management, such as rest
grazing and grazing prohibition, increase carbon sequestration, and promote local development.
The project proponent is National Forestry and Grassland Administration Northwest Investigation
and Planning Institute.
The project area is located in Ngari, covering Gar County, Burang County, Zanda County, Rutog
County, GÃª'gyai County, GÃªrzÃª County and CoqÃªn County. According to the Participatory Rural
Appraisal (PRA) report. Before the implementation of the project, there were severely degradation
and desertification of the grasslands in this area due to the impact of climate change and human
activities, some grassland even degenerated into ""black soil beach"", the excellent forages in the
plant community almost disappeared, and the natural reproduction and renewal ability was very
low. According to the Parameters for Degradation, Desertification and Salinization of Rangeland
(GB19377-2003) in China15, moderately degraded grassland areas refer to the total grass yield
decreased by 21%-50% compared with that before degradation and the total grass yield
decreased by more than 50% compared with that before degradation is regarded as severely
degraded grasslands.
Totally, 373,467.02 ha of degraded grassland in Ngari have been managed sustainably including
rest grazing and grazing prohibition by fence building and seeding of local high-quality forage.
There are three main restoration measures as followed in the project:
(1) Rest grazing was implemented in moderately degraded grassland areas where grass yield
was 130-190kg/Mu 16 which decreased by 21-50% compared with the non-degraded
grassland. It is required that grazing shall not be allowed within 120 days when the grass
turns green every year (from 01-May to 31-August) through the construction of fence and
sustainable management. Through the implementation of rest grazing, 322,770.02 ha of
degraded grassland were managed sustainably.
(2) Grazing prohibition was implemented in seriously degraded grasslands where grass yield
less than 130 Kg/Mu which decreased by more than 50% compared with the non-degraded
grassland. Fence building shall be carried out in the grazing prohibition area. When the
construction is completed, grazing prohibition shall be implemented for 5 years. After that,
14 ""Black soil beach"" is an extreme type of grassland degradation caused by overgrazing, human factors, rat and
insect damage, climate warming and other factors.
15GB19377-2003 is a national standard document of the people's Republic of China which issued by The Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Affairs to assess the level of degradation, desertification and salinization of natural grassland.

CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3
under the premise of not affecting the normal growth of the improved grassland, the
grassland should be used reasonably and sustainably according to the local approved
livestock carrying capacity. For the project, totally 40,801.00 ha of degraded grassland have
been managed sustainably by grazing prohibition.
(3) Black soil beach restoration was implemented in moderately degraded grassland areas
where grass yield was less than 150 Kg/Mu and the proportion of bare patches in grassland
exceeds 40% which decreased by 21%-50% compared with the non-degraded grassland.
Reseeding grass, scientific fertilization and irrigation are carried out to restore grassland
vegetation greatly based on rodent and pest control on the ""black soil beach"" degraded
grassland in the project area. After reseeding the grass, the project area needs to be fenced
for 3 years to better restore grassland vegetation. Then under the premise of not affecting the
normal growth of the improved grassland, the grassland should be used reasonably and
sustainably according to the local approved livestock carrying capacity. The grass seeds
sowed were local high-quality forage such as Elymus nutans (Drooping tassel grass). In the
project, 9,896.00 ha of ""black soil"" degraded grassland have been reseeded grass.
In addition to these main restoration measures, the project also alleviates soil desertification and
restores grassland vegetation through grassland management measures to improve soil carbon
storage and local biodiversity, supplemented by daily management measures of other protection
projects, such as grassland fire prevention and rodent control, so as to ensure long-term
sustainable management of the project area. The project is estimated to generate GHG emission
removals of 11,698,413 tCO e in 40 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 2
292,460 tCO e. 2
The objectives of the project including:
Climate: Restore the degraded grassland ecosystem, increase grassland coverage, increase
grassland carbon sink function and reduce GHG emissions.
Community: Improve the livelihood of local herders, provide permanent and temporary job
opportunities for them, increase their income. Provide technical skills and training in sustainable
grassland management. Protect the sacred mountains (Kang Rinpoche) and holy waters (Lake
Manasarovar) widely respected by the Tibetan people which is conducive to the protection and
development of Tibet's traditional Zhangzhung culture. Zhangzhung culture is the traditional
culture of the Tibetan people, also known as the basic culture of Tibet. The traces of ancient
Zhangzhung culture run through all aspects of Tibet. From production to life, from folk custom17 to
belief, there is the shadow of Zhangzhung culture everywhere. For example, religious activities
such as offering sacrifices to mountain gods and turning mountains18 are all derived from the
Zhangzhung culture.
Biodiversity: Provide more suitable habitats for wild animals and increase local biodiversity.
17 The ancient Zhangzhung Buddha dharma occupies the supreme position in the traditional culture of ancient
Zhangzhung culture. It is the oldest Buddha Dharma in Tibet, the oldest Buddha Dharma in human history, and the
general source of all Buddha dharmas

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice
cultivation is conducted in Suicheng District and Huanglo Town within Suixi County,
Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province of China, with a total acreage of 6,545 ha for double-
cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, the continuously flooded method
would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method
is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can
emit a large amount of methane (CH ) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent 4
flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane
emission reduction than the continuously flooded.
This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results
in not only large amount of methane (CH ) emissions but also low rice productivity by 4
replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens
the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH emission 4
can be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an
estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 9.15 tCO e/ha for double-cropping rice is 2
expected. Annual average estimation of GHG emission reductions from the project activity
is 59,906 tCO e/year, and the total GHG emission reductions are 599,060 tCO e during the 2 2
fixed 10 years crediting period.
This project aims to:
- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;
- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;
- Increase the number of local individuals who have relevant skills due to diversified
educational opportunities from trainings;
- Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers.

The project site is located at 29o 01"" N latitude and 770 45â E longitudes.
The project is located 32 km from district headquarter Meerut on the Meerut-Baraut road. The
nearest railway station is Meerut and nearest airport is Delhi Airport.
1.6 Duration of the project activity/crediting period:
The Project Activity Start Date is 23rd January, 2006 which is the commissioning date of the
turbine and boiler. This is the date on which the project activity began displacing Greenhouse
gases (GHGs) emissions into the atmosphere.
Crediting period start date:
The crediting period start date is 01/04/2006.
1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:
The project activity is a Greenfield project activity. It has been taken up at the new 160 KLPD
distillery unit at Kinauni, Meerut. In the absence of the project activity the PP would have
treated the spent wash in an anaerobic open lagoon and imported the electricity from the grid.
1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG
emission reductions and/or removal enhancements:
The project activity involves treatment of the spent-wash in the anaerobic reactor and
capturing the generated biogas and also the utilization of captured biogas along with bagasse
for generation of steam and electricity. It is assumed that CO emissions from surplus biomass 2
do not lead to changes of carbon pools in the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry
(LULUCF) sector.
In the absence of the project activity the Project Proponent (PP) would have treated the spent
wash in the anaerobic open lagoon system which would have resulted in emission of methane
enriched biogas into the atmosphere. In the absence of the project activity the PP would have
generated the steam by firing bagasse/biomass in a low pressure boiler and imported the
electricity from the grid. Thus, the generation of power in the project activity would result in
displacement of equivalent electricity generation in the grid and its associated CO emission. 2
Hence the Project activity reduces the CH4 emissions into the atmosphere that would have
been emitted from the treatment of the spent wash through open lagoon system and also
displaces the equivalent amount of electricity generation from the fossil fuel based grid
connected power plant and its associated GHG emissions

1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
As the project activity is the installation of a new grid-connected renewable power
plant/unit, does not involve generation of GHG emissions for the purpose of their
subsequent reduction, removal or destruction.
Prior to project initiation, the site was a vacant land. In absence of project activity, the
site will continue current practice i.e. equivalent amount electricity to be generated by the
project activity would have been generated from grid connected fossil fuel dominated
power plants.
The pre-project scenario and baseline scenario are the same, please refer to Section 2.4
for more details of the baseline scenario.
1.11 Compliance with Laws, Statutes and Other Regulatory Frameworks
In April 2015, Tunisia issued the Renewable Energy Law for Electricity Production
(No.74/2013). The Law seeks to encourage investment in renewable energy and
consequently increasing the contribution of renewable energy electricity to 30%
(equivalent to 3,800 MW) of total electricity production by 20301.
As renewable energy is encouraged in Tunisia, the project activity is in line with all
national/ local laws and regulations.

PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The Fresh Breeze afforestation project covers 4,269.82, hectares of land, which are adjacent to
cattle, on which forest plantations for obtaining high-value, long-lived timber products and for
sequestering large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere will be established. The
project activity is established in the states of Tabasco, Nayarit and Chiapas, Mexico.
The project activity is categorized as a grouped project due to the project foresees an average
expansion of 1,200 hectares per year, adding new project areas and instances from the future
years.
The project will result in a significant contribution to sustainable development of Mexico, mainly
through: i) increased employment and quality of employment; ii) rural development
(decentralization); iii) increased gross value of production; iv) improved fiscal balance; v)
biodiversity preservation and vi) improvement and preservation of soil quality.
Overall objective of proposed A/R project activity
The overall objective of the A/R activity is to contribute to mitigate climate change while meeting
the growing demand for quality wood products from well managed plantation forests and
contributing to sustain environmental management, community development and poverty
alleviation in Mexico.
Specific objectives of the proposed A/R project activity
1) Capture carbon dioxide through forest planting, generating high quality emission reductions in
greenhouse gases (GHG) that can be measured, monitored and verified. The project
participants strive to demonstrate that carbon sequestration from forest plantations is a viable
instrument to encourage private investment in the forestry sector, especially on degraded
lands.
2) Promote environmental conservation such as soil conservation, water sources and
biodiversity of the region, protection of flora and fauna species. Proteak UNO SAB de C.V.
has a protection program of species during and after the project implementation.
3) Take care of the biodiversity, creating biological corridors within our plantations
4) Socio-Economic development in the local communities through:
- Promoting tree plantation and afforestation activities in the local communities.
- Providing employment opportunities.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The proposed solar grouped project activity consists of an installation and implementation of
Solar Photovoltaic Power plants located in different departments within Colombian territory. The
implementation of grouped project activity ensures energy security, diversification of the grid
generation mix and sustainable growth of the electricity generation sector in Colombia.
All project activity instances within this grouped project activity will consist of single solar
renewable technology. Also, an individual project activity instance will either be small-scale
(having methodology AMS I.D version 18.0) or large-scale (having methodology ACM0002
version 19.0).
Before the implementation of the project activity, no power plants were installed at the project
site. The energy that will be generated by the grouped project is currently dispatched by other
power plants that are connected to the national grid, and that include fossil fuel power plants.
Hence, the baseline scenario and the scenario prior to project implementation are the same and
the project will help to reduce thermal power generation in the National Interconnected System
(SIN1) by providing renewable energy to the grid.
The first phase of the solar grouped project will have a total installed capacity of 229.45 MW, with
the installation of 742,289 Solar Photovoltaic units. The electricity generated by the grouped
project is expected to be around 447.09 GWh per year, which will be delivered to the SIN, to a
third party, or represents a project activity that results in savings of electricity that would have
been provided by the grid; avoiding part of the electricity generated by the grid-connected power
plants. Thus, it will contribute to sustainability by increasing the share of renewable energy and
reducing GHG emissions.
All the project activity instances i.e. renewable energy generation of Solar Photovoltaic â SPV
plants to be included in this grouped project, will be within Colombia only (see Table 1). Hence
the location and geographical boundary of the grouped project can be defined as Colombia. The
estimated annual emission reductions over a 10-year period of first crediting period from initial 6
project activity instances are 79,870 tCO e/year. The total emission reductions for 10 years 2
crediting period will be approximately 798,704 tCO e. 2

What is the methodology of this project?,"

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
Based on the information provided in the UNFCCC website, 4 projects identified in step 2, have been
registered as CDM project activities. Therefore,
N = 37 all
- Step 4: within similar projects identified in Step 3, identify those that apply technologies that are
different to the technology applied in the proposed project activity. Note their number N . diff
All the projects identified in Step 3 apply technologies that are different to the technology applied in the
proposed project activity. Thus,
N = 37 diff
Step 5: calculate factor F = 1 â N / N representing the share of similar projects (penetration rate of diff all
the measure/technology) using a measure/technology similar to the measure/technology used in the
proposed project activity that deliver the same output or capacity as the proposed project activity.
F= 1 â 37 / 37 = 0.00
The proposed project activity is a âcommon practiceâ within a sector in the applicable geographical
area if the factor F is greater than 0.2 and N â N is greater than 3. all diff
As the factor F is not greater than 0.2 sand N -N is equal to zero, the proposed project activity is not all diff
a common practice.
As a result of applying the âTool for demonstration and assessment of additionalityâ it is concluded that
based on conservative approaches and assumptions, the proposed project activity fulfills all the
additionality requirements demonstrating that it is additional.
Outcome of Step 4: As the outcome of Step 4 is that the proposed project activity is not regarded as
âcommon practiceâ, as demonstrated above, then, the proposed project activity is additional.
2.6 Methodology Deviations
The present project activity does not incur in any deviation from the applicable methodology.
3 QUANTIFICATION OF GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND REMOVALS
3.1 Baseline Emissions
According to ACM0002 Version 19.0 baseline emissions include only CO emissions from 2
electricity generation in fossil fuel fired power plants that are displaced due to the project activity.
The methodology assumes that all project electricity generation would have been generated by
existing grid-connected power plants and the addition of new grid-connected power plants.
The baseline emissions are to be calculated as follows:
= Â· BE EG EF
y PJ,y grid,CM,y
Where:
BE = Baseline emissions in year y (tCO /yr) y 2
EG = Quantity of net electricity generation that is produced and fed into the PJ,y
v3.3 26","The methodology of this project is outlined in the ""Tool for demonstration and assessment of additionality."" It involves determining the factor F, which represents the share of similar projects that apply technologies different from the proposed project activity. The project activity is considered a ""common practice"" if the factor F is greater than 0.2 and there are more than 3 similar projects.

View of the project participant on the contribu tion of the project activity to sustainable 
development  
 
The project proponent has essentially carried out investment in the project after analyzing the 
overall benefits to the community & environment. The approach is also in line with the sustainable development guidelines
2 of the Ministry of Environment & Forests (MoEF) of 
Government of India (GoI).  
 
1. Social well being: 
 
The wind installations are carried out depending upon the wind potential of the site and 
thus may not be implemented close to load centers. This results in the scattered 
implementation of wind projects thereby resulting in strengthening of local feeders and 
rural grids which in turn increases the availability of electricity in the nearby villages / 
suburban areas.   
Implementation of the project activity will also contribute towards meeting the electricity 
deficit in the state of Maharashtra / NEWNE regional grid of India. 
 
2. Environmental well being: 
 
The project activity essentially uses the available wind potential at the site which is 
converted into electricity; the operation of this facility is in tandem with environment as there are no emissions from the project activity. 
 
3. Economic well being: 
 Implementation of the project activity has helped in developing the local economy; create 
employment opportunities for the local skilled a nd semi skilled people, which is a priority 
concern for the Government of India.   
4. Technological well being: 
 
Increased interest in wind energy projects  will further push research efforts by technology 
providers to develop more efficient and better technology in  future.  Thus, the investment 
in candidate VCS project and other such projects will assist in promotion of better & new 
technologies.  
 
1.5 Project location including geographic an d physical information allowing the 
unique identification and delineation of the specific extent of the project: 
 The project is spread over three districts namely  Dhule, Sangli and Nandurbar in the state of 
Maharashtra.  The information allowing for the unique identification of the WEGs is as follows:

The United Nations approved consolidated baseline methodology
applicable to this project is ACM0002 âConsolidated methodology for
grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sourcesâ,
Version 12.1.0. The methodology is applicable to grid-connected
renewable power generation project activities that (a) install a new
power plant at a site where no renewable power plant was operated
prior to the implementation of the project activity (greenfield
plant); (b) involve a capacity addition; (c) involve a retrofit of
(an) existing plant(s); or (d) involve a replacement of (an) existing
plant(s).
The methodology is applicable under the following conditions:
â¢ The project activity is the installation, capacity addition,
retrofit or replacement of a power plant/unit of one of the
following types: hydro power plant/unit (either with a run-of-
river reservoir or an accumulation reservoir), wind power
plant/unit, geothermal power plant/unit,solar power plant/unit,
wave power plant/unit or tidal power plant/unit;
â¢ In the case of capacity additions, retrofits or replacements
(except for wind, solar, wave or tidal power capacity addition
projects which use Option 2: on page 11 to calculate the
parameter EG ): the existing plant started commercial PJ,y
operation prior to the start of a minimum historical reference
period of five years, used for the calculation of baseline
emissions and defined in the baseline emission section, and no
capacity expansion or retrofit of the plant has been undertaken
between the start of this minimum historical reference period
and the implementation of the project activity;
â¢ In case of hydro power plants, one of the following conditions
must apply:
o The project activity is implemented in an existing reservoir,
with no change in the volume of reservoir; or
o The project activity is implemented in an existing reservoir,
where the volume of reservoir is increased and the power
density of the project activity, as per definitions given in
the Project Emissions section, is greater than 4 W/m2; or
o The project activity results in new reservoirs and the power
density of the power plant, as per definitions given in the
Project Emissions section, is greater than 4 W/m2.
The methodology is applicable as the proposed project is a grid-
connected greenfield hydropower plant project with a power density
greater than 4 W/m2.
ACM0002 refers to the following tools: âTool for the demonstration
and assessment of additionalityâ, Version 05.2, and âTool to
calculate the emission factor for an electricity system, Version

1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
The project activity correspond a new hydropower Plant installed at a site with no other power
generation plants operating prior to the project initiation.
The project consider a new reservoir with a flood area of 282 ha which 132 ha are now flooded by
the river.
The power density of the project activity is calculated according the installed capacity of the
hydropower plant after and before the implementation of the project activity (0 and 150,000,000 W
respectively) and considering the area of the reservoir measured in the surface of the water, after
and before the implementation of the project activity (132 and 282 ha respectively) (equation 12 in
section 3.2 indicates how to determined the power density). Therefore, the power density of the
project activity results in 100 W/m2.
The project main purpose involves the generation of renewable energy. The project replaces
energy from the grid partially generated by fossil fuel-fired power plants reducing the GHG
emissions. It will help Chile as a developing country to stimulate and commercialise the use of grid
connected renewable energy technologies that are required according to the article 150 bis of the
Chilean General Electric service Law Directive (DFL4/2006), published on 17 January /2006 in the
Official gazette (available at www.bcn.cl).

A professional legal analysis has confirmed that the landowners have the exclusive rights to all
environmental services provided by their land, comprising any ecosystem payments that cover
the cost of improving natural resources management and conservation activities in their land in
exchange for the carbon finance benefits, including communal landowners known as Ejidos,
Ejidos are a type of communal land in Mexico in which the traditional communities that inhabit
the area have the collective property and usufruct rights of the land given by the Mexican State,
as indicated in Article 9 of Mexicoâs Agrarian Law3.
The grouped project area currently encompasses a total of 175,880 ha in the state of Nayarit.
More project activity instances will be added to this grouped project in later PD versions. Within
the grouped project area there are currently nine project activity instances, which are mainly
ejidos.
BlueMX Mangrove A.C. has been collaborating and engaging with each ejidosâ authority, called
Ejidoâs Commissariat, in order to establish partnerships and obtain their free, prior, and informed
consent (FPIC) to develop the project activities. The Ejidoâs Commissariat is responsible for the
execution of the deal publicly agreed at the ejidoâs assembly, as well as the governance,
representation, and administrative management of all ejido activities (Article 32, Mexicoâs
Agrarian Law).
The project proponent signed agreements with each ejido and private landowners. The
agreements confirm the landownerâs or ejidoâs endorsement to develop the project activities,
recognise the required ownership transfer of the carbon credits to BlueMX Mangrove A.C., and
confirms the landownersâ collaboration as key partners of the blue carbon conservation project.

1.7 Ownership
The tree plantation is usually done by the farm land owner or tenants. Since the agricultural fields
are all legal agricultural fields, and the ownership is clear, there is no dispute over land ownership
in the project site. The land ownership of the farmers can also be assessed through the state
govt records . During the implementation period, Core CarbonX Solutions Private Limited through
its resource person or through partners will monitor and build awareness among farmers for
participating in the agroforestry project. Core CarbonX Solutions Private Limited is responsible
for supervising coordinators to train and motivate the farmers. Furthermore, these farmers, being
owners of the agroforestry fields have right to authorize Core CarbonX Solutions Private Limited
to have overall control and responsibility for the agroforestry project as the project proponent
without any violation to farmersâ rights. Core CarbonX Solutions Private Limited is the developer
of agroforestry project. Each participating farmer transfers the carbon rights to Core CarbonX
Solutions Private Limited through an agreement. The profit from this carbon reduction project is
shared with the participating farmers.

1.17 Sustainable Development Contributions
The CCX Agroforestry project contributes to the sustainable development of the erstwhile fallow lands.
The project results in the achievement of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
specifically SDGs numbering 1,3, 8, 13 and 15.
SDG 1: No poverty
One of major sectors of Indiaâs economy is agriculture. A large proportion of Indiaâs population is
dependent on agriculture and allied activities for survival and income. When farmers own lands which
become degraded due to non-cultivation, their incomes are affected as they are often mostly small and
marginal farmers and their lands are not productive enough. These farmers/land owners have often only
one source of income making them vulnerable to poverty in case of crop failure. Therefore, carrying out
afforestation/reforestation on fallow or barren lands will increase and/or diversify their sources of
income. Diversified sources of income can make local communities comparatively less vulnerable and
more resilient to financial stresses. The carbon credits generated from such activity will result in carbon
income that can protect the local communities from poverty to some extent. The project activity
contributes to SDG 1 of working towards the goal of âNo Povertyâ
SDG 3 âGood health and well-being
Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen as part of their photosynthesis process. The
project activity would protect communities from air and noise pollution and improve their health. The cool
surroundings of trees and the resultant fauna could be locales for recreation thereby improving the

1.1.1 Overview
The MJCPP is based on a strong partnership involving the
following parties:
- Rural communities represented by the Union des
producteurs de PourghÃ¨re2 de Kita.
- DÃ©guessiVert, a dynamic Malian agro-business.
- Novartis, a major international pharmaceutical company.
- Eco-Carbone, a French investor that
develops Jatropha and carbon projects
-
Novartis, DÃ©guessiVert and Eco-Carbone have established
Jatropha Mali Initiatives (JMI) a joint venture company to manage
the project activities. One of the reason Novartis has entered the
project was to buy the carbon credits generated by the plantation.
For that matter, they bought a part of the credits in advance, which
allowed JMI to start its activities.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
JMI and its international agro-scientific partners develop technical support throughout the
project, specifically developing best practices regarding variety selection, nursery technology and
agroforestry management techniques. For the
past five years, JMI has been promoting a 3 500smallholders based agroforestry system in Mali by
investing in and managing the establishment of sustainable Jatropha curcas plantations. The system
consists in planting rows of Jatropha in association with other crops.
In Kita circle, the total area cultivated with crops at the start of the project is 157 000 ha and JMI aims to
plant up to 15 000 ha of Jatropha by 2017 in this area.

1.1.2 A community based approach (approved by Agence FranÃ§aise de
DÃ©veloppement)
Jatropha is a rustic oilseed bearing tree, which adapts to a wide range of tropical climatic
conditions. Jatropha has been present for years in the ecologically-suited Sudano-Sahelian belt as live
fencing to protect gardens and food crops from livestock. According to recent studies, the Sahel today
would count about 10,000 km of this type of fencing3. Its seeds contain at least 30% oil, which is used
locally in JMI's project as a direct source of biofuel,to produce electricity or for the soap industry.
Biofuel is used locally where fossil fuel access is very difficult. Mali has no easy access to the sea, so
the demand for this kind of biofuel, which moreover is cheaper than fossil fuel, is very high. The sale of
these products will allow JMI to insure sustainable revenue to its farmers partners. The by-product of
the oil is a high quality organic fertilizer, used in the agroforestry systems. In addition, Jatropha trees
sequestrate carbon. With an average of 1,200 trees per hectare, a plantation can sequestrate up to
around 120 tCO2/ha over a period of 10 years.
size
Each
farmer chooses its plantation plot(s) on his own non-forested land. Therefore, the project's numerous
plantation plots are located all over Kita circle. In order to strengthen its partnership with local farmers,

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project is to change from continuously flooded regimes to intermittently flooded regimes
during rice cultivation in Youyang County, Chongqing City, China, with a total acreage of 16,548
ha of single-cropping rice. A total of 8,533 households (36,351 farmers) were involved in the
project. Without the project, local villagers would not have access to intermittently flooded
technology and intact facilities to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional
continuously flooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was
cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Due to the anaerobic
decomposition of organic matter in the paddy soil under flooded conditions, a large amount of
methane can be released, so the intermittently flooded method is more conducive to water
efficiency, improving rice yield and reducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded
method.
The implementation activities of the project include promoting intermittently flooded technology,
technical training for the farmers, facility repair and replacement, etc. According to the needs of
rice growth, farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only
saves water resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under
anaerobic conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to
the rice paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice
paddies in the rainy season.
The project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions by 365,337 tCO e in the first seven-year 2
period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 52,191 tCO e. The project aims to 2
reduce GHG and mitigate climate changes, increase rice productivity resulting in higher living
standards for local farmers and provide more job opportunities.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
This project is categorized as sectoral scope 14 (AFOLU) under Verra as justified in Section 1.3,

Captive Consumption
Prior to the project activity project proponent has been meeting its power demand from Tamilnadu Electricity Board
(TNEB) supply.The power that is being generated by the project activity was in the pre project scenario being produced
by the power plants connected to the southern grid.
1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG
emission reductions and/or removal enhancements:
Project proponent consumes considerable quantum of power for their operations. This power demand was met from
fossil fuel dominant state owned electric utility. The project activity would provide renewable power from wind energy
to Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) thereby reducing its reliance on non-renewable power from state owned
electric utility which is fossil fuel dominant. Thus the project activity would reduce Green House Gas (GHG) into the
atmosphere.

1.4 Project Eligibility
General eligibility
The KA'A PYAHU REDD+ project is eligible under the scope of the VCS program for responding to REDD+
activities, under an independent project scheme for the validation and verification of GHG emission
reductions in accordance with ISO 14064-2:2019 and ISO 14064-3: 2019. According with section 2.1 of
the VCS Standard (V 4.7), the activities of the project are not excluded.
AFOLU project eligibility
According to the VCS Standard V 4.7, eligible REDD activities are those that reduce net GHG emissions
by reducing deforestation and/or degradation of forests, which is the case of the KA'A PYAHU REDD+
project. Deforestation is the direct, human-induced conversion of forestland to non-forest land.
The analysis of land use categories in the project is based mainly on Mapbiomas2 which utilizes a satellite
imagery dataset used composed by Landsat 5 (Thematic Mapper), Landsat 7 (Enhanced Thematic
Mapper Plus) and Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager), Landsast sensors. The MapBiomas classification
scheme is a hierarchical system with a combination of LULC classes compatible with the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) and IBGE classification systems (Souza, et al., 2020). In this regard, the
project meets the internationally accepted definition of forest, and was qualified as forest for a minimum
of 10 years before the project start date. The definition of forest may include mature forests, secondary
forests, and degraded forests.
According with the VCS standard, activities covered under the REDD project category are those that are
designed to stop planned (designated and sanctioned) deforestation or unplanned (unsanctioned)
deforestation and/or degradation. In this context, as described in section 1.9, the actions carried out in
the KA'A PYAHU REDD+ project, with the creation of the association, are oriented towards the defense,
preservation and conservation of the environment. Specifically, by taking action to combat the
environmental and social impacts caused by the construction of the power line. This project activity stops
unplanned deforestation and reduces GHG emissions by stopping deforestation of forests.

2.1 Project Goals, Design and Long-Term Viability
2.1.1 Summary Description of the Project (G1.2)
The HIWI REDD+ Project is a 20,505.00 hectares area of tropical rainforest located close to the
municipalities of Bujari, Rio Branco and Porto Acre, in the state of Acre, Northern Brazil. The project
will promote forest conservation and, consequently, reduce greenhouse gas emission that would occur
due to illegal deforestation. A consortium of 4 rural properties comprises the Hiwi REDD+ Project Area.
The state of Acre is facing a rise in deforestation due to cattle ranching activities, with an 8.3% increase
of cattle heads from 2020 to 202115. In one decade, the herd increased about 50% in the State16, the
majority being small and medium ranches17. Bujari has 36.80% of its area used for pasture, for Porto
Acre and Rio Branco, the percentage is of 45.11% and 27.17%, respectively18. The municipality of Rio
Branco has the highest cattle herd in the State, with 14% of the total15. Bujari also presented an increase
of 15.5% from 2018 to 202019, while in Porto Acre the growth was of 23.5% in the same period. Likewise,
deforestation in the municipalities from 2018 to 2020 had a boost of 198%, 89% and 154%,

site directly abuts neighbourhoods in all directions except to the south, where there is
approximately 70 meter buffer of woodland, and to the west, where a small 1 ha industrial
campus buffers additional communities.
The DPP facility is located at an elevation of 37 meters above sea level, in a humid tropical
savanna climate, with mean monthly precipitation of 120.4mm. The prevailing winds are from the
northeast, with mean wind speeds of 2.3 m/s. Sudden changes, caused by easterly winds, can
cause violent disturbances.
On the northeast section of the site location, an electric substation owned by ETED has two of ten
bays dedicated to Los Minas V and VI, while a third bay will be used by the combined cycle unit.
There is an abandoned shoe factory on the site, which will be removed upon construction. Two
fuel oil tanks from the decommissioned ITABOS unit 1 and 2 have already been removed. An
additional two fuel oil storage tanks remain, which served Los Minas III and IV before the fuel
switch to natural gas in 2003.
The spatial extent of the project boundaries encompasses the two gas turbines at the project site
being converted to closed cycle (Los Mina 5 and Los Mina 6) and the associated HRSG and
steam turbine (as shown in the diagram below) and all power plants physically connected to the
electricity grid that the proposed VCS project is connected to, as defined in âTool to calculate
emission factor for an electricity systemâ.
In the calculation of project emissions, only CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion at the
project plant are considered.

1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
The existing generating facility in Los Mina is a 210 MW plant, currently operating in open cycle
configuration. It comprises two natural-gas fired Siemens W501D5 (Originally Westinghouse
W501D5) combustion gas turbines with effective production of 105 MW each, and a WESTAC
generator. The turbinesâ expected lifetime is at least 40 years and the generatorsâ expected
lifetime is at least 30 years. Both were commissioned on 1996, and therefore have more than 13
years left. Therefore the existing power plant was not implemented to generate GHG emissions
but to generate electricity. The proposed project will only make the power plant more efficient and
reduce the amount of GHG emissions per kWh generated.

The project activity also induces environmental and sustainable development benefits. The project activity
has introduced efficient high pressure cogeneration technology to the Indian sugar industry; reducing power
shortages in the state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) India; and, fostering sustainable economic growth through
promoting energy self-sufficiency and resource conservation in Indiaâs sugarcane industry.
The policy to grow in a sustainable manner with commitment towards environment has been adopted by the
company. Decision to invest in a high pressure cogeneration system has been taken considering revenues
through sale of carbon credits under the clean development mechanism (CDM). Technology used in the
proposed activity is highly replicable as the countryâs sugar mills produce large quantities of bagasse that
could be efficiently utilized to generate power.
Projectâs contribution to sustainable development
The project activity contributes towards local, national and global sustainable development. It supports
Indiaâs national policy to rely on clean power. The governmentâs clean power diversification strategy focus
on reducing wastage of energy combined with the optimum use of renewable energy (RE) sources.
The project activity substitutes, and hence decreases the dependence on primarily coal-based power
generation by the grid, thereby reducing carbon dioxide (CO )emissions. Coal which is a carbon intensive 2
fuel, and emits large quantity of GHGs is being used to meet around 70% of the countryâs electricity
demand in 2005. Diversification and energy self-reliance by the sugarcane industry results in GHG
emission reduction. The project activity positively contributes towards the reduction in demand for carbon
intensive energy resources, efficient waste disposal and resource conservation.
The project activity has contributed to jobs creation in local rural area where cane growers (local farmers)
face highly cyclical income flows. It has created higher value jobs at the cogeneration facility. The inflow
of carbon credits from the Projectâs net emission reductions would create a replicable model for the
countryâs sugarcane industry, hence contributing towards sustainable development.

1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
Title: Grid Connected Electricity Generation from Renewable Sources
Reference: ACM 0002 (Version 18.1)3
For the determination of the baseline, the official methodology ACM0002 version 18.1, âLarge-scale
Consolidated baseline methodology for grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sourcesâ4, is
applied, using conservative options and data as presented in the following section. This methodology refers
to five Tools, which are:
1. Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system (Version 6.0.0)5;
2. Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality (Version 07.0.0)6;
3. Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality (Version 07.0.0)7;
4. Tool to calculate project or leakage CO emissions from fossil fuel combustion (Version 03.0.0)8. 2
5. Tool to determine the remaining lifetime of the equipment (Version 01.0.0.)9
The first tool is used for baseline calculation and second tool is used for additionality assessment. As third
tool is the combination of the first and second tool, it is not used. Since no project emission or leakage
calculation is required for wind power project, fourth tool is not used, and finally to determine the remaining
lifetime of the equipment, fifth tool is used.
Since the project activity is a wind power plant, the respective sectoral scope is scope 1: âEnergy Industry
â Renewable/Non-renewable Sourcesâ. Project participant hereby confirms that this is not a grouped
project.

permanent preservation areas (PPA) of the watercourses must be fully preserved. The
management plan will be presented in the PD and the information will be used in the
quantification of GHG emission reductions and removals presented in section 3 and 4.
Leakage management
It is assumed that leakage manifests itself mainly as changes in land use (cattle ranching, timber,
etc.) in the project surroundings. These land-uses have become more uses have become more
economically attractive than the sustainable management of forest resources, mainly due to the
following factors: market pressure; occupation of border areas and other areas where law
enforcement and command-and-control are not effective; among other secondary factors.
The Project proponents will adopt proactive initiatives to fight these leakage sources, based on a
cooperative effort with local stakeholders to promote a new approach to forest and land use in
the region.
1.12 Project Location
1.13 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
â¢ Ecosystem type:
The boundaries of the Tauari REDD+ Project are 100% covered by the Amazon Rainforest
biome. Three forest types are present in the project area: Submontane Open
Ombrophylous Forest (As); Submontane Dense Ombrophylous Forest (Ds); and
Submontane Semideciduous Forest (Fs)11.
â¢ Current and historical land-use:
The project area is entirely forest for at least 10 years, as detailed in the section â1.3
Project Eligibilityâ. Sustainable forest management (SFM) has been carried out since
2013 (it started in UniÃ£o Farm and is currently carried out only in UniÃ£o and Continental
Farms).
The common practice established in the region is the invasion of the area and extraction
the wood that can be used for sale (commercially viable) and then clear the area using
fire, the clearing with fire takes place until it is feasible to install pasture for cattle.
Without the TAUARI REDD+ project, the project area is vulnerable to these external
threatâs (common practices).
11 The variations in these forest types were defined by the topographic and latitudinal variation:

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
In total, more than 2 300 ha shared by 1 800 small-scale farmers organized in Acopagro
cooperative will be reforested, in the North of Peru, Region San Martin, provinces of Mariscal
Caceres, Huallaga, Bellavista and Picota. The lands to reforest are cocoa plantations (64%),
âpurmasâ (unproductive lands2 : 33%), and others plantations (3%). The aim is to plant 2 million of
trees over a period of 6 years for a total of 1 150 000 tons of additional CO equivalent captured on 2
40 years.
Most of all, the Alto Huayabamba Project adds to sustainable development, offering social,
environmental and economic benefits.
- It helps people reforest and therefore bring an added value to their lands and ensure them a long-
term income that can be used to pay for the studies of their children or for their retirement pension.
As a consequence, it will provoke a local socio-economic development.
- It fights deforestation and its consequences, such as soil erosion, decrease of water availability,
natural disasters, landscapes degradation, and decrease of biodiversity. It also increases farmersâ
awareness about these primordial issues.
- It promotes agro-forestry, an agricultural system which enables access to environmental services
recognized by the Peruvian law: conservation of water resources, preservation of biodiversity,
conservation of landscapes, protection against natural disasters (Forestry Law NÂ° 27308, year 2000),
and fire risks control. Agro-forestry systems keeps on being the best strategy of management and
protection against the global climate change effects.
- Last but not least, it will create carbon credits, and therefore contribute to the climate change
mitigation through economic implication of large organizations.
The project is developed as a long-term project, with a project longevity of 80 years (maintenance of
management practices over 80 years)

Higher Operating and Maintenance (O&M) expenses: For the proposed
wind power project considered in this PDD, as per the O&M contract
between BPCL and Enercon, the O&M expenses will be INR 0.45
million/MW for the next eight years with an annual escalation. At
this rate at the end of the eighth year the annual O&M expense
would be INR 0.76 million/MW; an increase of 70% from the base
yearâs O&M expenditure. Thus, in a scenario where the PPA (the rate
at which the power will be sold by BPCL to HESCOM) is kept constant
for ten years is likely to present a financial barrier to the
project developer. A scenario where O & M and costs are expected on
annual basis, a constant tariff for ten years presents a financial
barrier to a wind developer.
1.12 Demonstration to confirm that the project was not implemented to create GHG emissions
primarily for the purpose of its subsequent removal or destruction.
The main purpose of the project activity is to generate electricity
by utilising the wind flow at Nargund project ` As explained in
section 1.9 of the VCS PD, the project activity produces clean
electric energy by making use of the energy available in the wind
flowing from the Nargund project. There are no GHG emissions in the
whole power generation process of the project activity. The project
promoters hereby confirm that the project is not implemented to
create GHG emissions for the purpose of its subsequent removal or
destruction.
1.13 Demonstration that the project has not created another form of environmental credit (for
example renewable energy certificate:
The project activity does not call for another environmental credit
or not taken under any other renewable energy certification. Hence
the project activities have not created another form of
environmental credit. The declaration letter from Bhoruka Power
Corporation Limited has been submitted to the DOE.
1.14 Project rejected under other GHG programs (if applicable):

Technological well-being:
The gear-less WEG technology being employed at Nargund Wind Power
Project is an improvement to the conventional technology that
employs the use of gears in the WEG. Apart from requiring less
operation and maintenance and being more efficient, the gearless
WEG also produce less sound leading to lower ambient acoustics (a)
Improves standard of life
The project activity will lead to creation of infrastructure in &
around the proposed project area, which improves the quality of
life of the local communities.
The project activity leads to an investment of around INR 431
million, which would not have happened in the absence of the
project activity.

1.17 Sustainable Development Contributions
Sustainable Development Contributions Activity Description
The project is already registered with VCS and currently undergoing renewable of crediting period
(RCP) and verification. The contribution of this project activity in terms of following four indicators
of sustainable development as stipulated by the National CDM Authority (NCDMA) of India is
provided below:
Social wellbeing:
Since, the project activity is in a rural area, it will aid in the development of the region by
generating direct and indirect employment opportunities for the local people. The project activity
will also cause development of infrastructure like roads which will benefit the population in the
nearby areas.
Economical wellbeing:
The project has created a business opportunity for local stakeholders such as suppliers,
manufacturers, contractors etc. Use of wind as a source of energy reduces the dependence on
imported fossil fuels like coal and associated price variation thereby leading to increased energy
security. It will also narrow the existing electricity supply gap in the State of Maharashtra as well
as India.
Environmental wellbeing:
Since, the project uses renewable source for power generation; it does not lead to any
greenhouse gas emission. Avoidance of fossil fuel consumption results in reduction of Sulpher
oxides (SOx), Oxides of nitrates (NOx) and particulate matter emission thus avoiding air pollution.
The project activity is a step towards environmental sustainability by preventing exploitation and
depletion of a natural, finite and non-renewable resource (fossil fuels). Consumption of large
quantities of water that is required in generation of electricity in current mix of power plants is
avoided.
Technological wellbeing:
The technology leads to utilization of environmentally safe and sound technologies in power
sector. The project harnesses wind power potential in the region and encourages setting up such
projects in near future. Increased interest in wind energy projects will encourage Research &
Development efforts by technology providers to develop more efficient and better equipment in
future.

In addition, forests of Nagaland protect the fragile hilly ecosystems of the state by preventing soil erosion and landslides.\r\n   \r\nHowever, specifically forests in Peren are gradually reducing in size. As well as the forests are also becoming increasingly prone to the fires during the dry summer months (April, May and June). Because of high anthropogenic pressures, the forests are also under extreme stress as a result of firewood collections. Therefore, Nagaland 4 Change, the Project Proponent is proposing a forest conservation project through funding from carbon financing under Verra VCS Mechanism. The main aim of the projects are as follows:\r\n1.\tConservation of existing forests by protecting the forest cover.\r\n2.\tIncreasing the forest cover as well as increasing density of the vegetation in forests.\r\n3.\tEnhancing the capacity of carbon storage of the forests, therefore generating carbon credits revenue out of it.\r\n4.\tMonitoring and reporting of the rare and endangered flora and fauna living the forests.\r\n5.\tProviding livelihood improvement to the local Naga communities through various interventions such as improved cookstoves, clean drinking water, etc.', 'project_state_province': 'Nagaland', 'project_country': 'India', 'project_latitude': 25.51, 'project_longitude': 93.74}",3,1,5,3,1,0.13,158,-,0.0016033696205137607,0.5666666666666667,0.10793650793650794,0.18133333333333332,0.0847457627118644,0.01592356687898089,0.02680965147453083,0.3,0.05714285714285714,0.09599999999999999,0.31666666666666665,0.06031746031746032,0.10133333333333333

VCS Project Description
1.6 Duration of the project activity/crediting period:
The duration of project activity is 20 years. Ten years fixed crediting period is chosen
for the project activity and the Crediting period start date is 03/02/2007
Project start date: 03/02/2007 (Earliest Commissioning Date)
The commissioning date for each of the wind mill under the bundled project activity is
given in the table below.
Table 3: Commissioning details of the project activity
5

VCS Project Description
For the bundled project activity, the project start date is the earliest date of the
commissioning of any wind mill. As per the table above, the earliest commissioning
date is for the wind mill no. WEG No. 2148 which is 03/02/2007.
Therefore the start date for this bundled project is 03/02/2007.
Crediting period start date: 03/02/2007
The earliest crediting period start date under VCS 2007 is 28th march 2006, as per
section 5.2.1 of VCS 2007. The Crediting period start date for this bundled project is
03/02/2007.
The duration of the crediting period is 10 years.
1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:
In the absence of the project activity, an equivalent quantum of electricity would have
been generated by the fossil-fuel dominated Southern Regional Electricity Grid of
India4 generation mix. The same would in turn result in GHG emissions at the grid
end as per the carbon intensity of the above mentioned grid. This scenario has been
identified as the baseline scenario for the project activity under consideration (please
refer to section 2.4 of the VCS PD for further details).
1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG emission reductions
and/or removal enhancements:
The project activity under consideration entails electricity generation through wind-
mills by harnessing wind power potential, a natural and renewable source of energy.
The project is expected to generate and export of 16.14 million kWh (approx) per
year to the Southern Regional Grid of India. In the absence of the project activity, an
equivalent quantity of electricity would have been generated by the Southern Grid by
a majority of fossil-fuel fired power plants. The same would have resulted in GHG
emissions as per the carbon intensity of the grid-mix.
As per the combined margin carbon intensity of the 0.928 tCO /MWh for the 2
Southern Grid, the bundled project activity would there by result in total CO emission 2
reduction of 1,49,800 tonnes over the crediting period of 10 years. For detailed
calculation procedure and sample calculation tables of the GHG emission reduction
quantum from the project activity, please refer to Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of the
VCS PD.
1.9 Project technologies, products, services and the expected level of activity:
In wind energy generation, kinetic energy of wind blowing at high speeds is
converted into mechanical energy while passing through the wind-turbine. The
rotation of the turbine blades results in the rotation of the generator mounted on the
same shaft, thus generating electricity. As there are no GHG emissions associated
with wind electricity generation, the technology is widely recognized as clean
4 The Indian power grid system (or the National Grid) is divided into two regional grids namely NEWNE Regional Grid
and Southern Region Grid. These regional grids have independent state Load Dispatch Centres (LDCs) that manage
flow of power in their jurisdiction. Power generated by state owned generation units and private owned generation
units is consumed by the respective states. Power generated by central sector plants is shared by all states forming
part of the grid in a fixed proportion.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project and its Implementation Status
The main purpose of this project activity is to generate clean form of electricity through renewable
wind energy source. The project involves installation of 100 MW wind project in State of Gujarat.
Over the 10 years of first crediting period, the project will replace anthropogenic emissions of
greenhouse gases (GHGâs) estimated to be approximately 172,333 tCO e per year, thereon 2
displacing 183,960 MWh/year amount of electricity from the generation-mix of power plants
connected to the Indian grid, which is mainly dominated by thermal/fossil fuel based power plant.
The details of the project is mentioned in the table below
Scenario existing prior to the implementation of project activity:
The scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project activity, is electricity delivered to
the grid by the project activity that would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-
connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as reflected in the
combined margin (CM) calculations described in the âTool to calculate the emission factor for an
electricity systemâ.
Baseline Scenario:
As per the applicable methodology, a Greenfield power plant is defined as âa new renewable
energy power plant that is constructed and operated at a site where no renewable energy power
plant was operated prior to the implementation of the project activityâ.
As the project activity falls under the definition of a Greenfield power plant, the baseline scenario
as per paragraph 22 of Section 5.2.1 of applied methodology is the following:
If the project activity is the installation of a Greenfield power plant, the baseline scenario is
electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by the
operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as
reflected in the combined margin (CM) calculations described in the âTool to calculate the
emission factor for an electricity systemâ.
Hence, pre-project scenario and baseline scenario are the same.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
Guohua Tongliao Kezuo Zhongqi Phase I 49.5 MW Wind Farm Project (hereinafter referred to as
âthe projectâ or project âPâ) is constructed and operated by Guohua (Tongliao) Wind Power Co.,
Ltd.
The project generates renewable power electricity by using the wind power resource, and
supplies electricity to Northeast China Power Grid (NECPG) replacing fossil fuel consumption and
thus reducing GHG (CO ) emissions. It involves installation and operation of 33 wind turbines 2
with the unit capacity of 1,500 kW and total capacity of 49.5 MW. It is estimated that the annual
generation of the proposed project will be 108,830MWh once fully operation, with a plant load
factor of 25.1%. The project lifetime is 21 years (including 1 year construction period).
The electricity currently generated by the Grid is relatively fossil fuel intensive, with a combined
margin emission factor of 1.0280 tCO /MWh. The proposed project is therefore expected to 2
reduce emissions of GHG of 111,877 tCO e per year during the first crediting period by displacing 2
electricity from NECPG.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
The Project under sectoral scope 1: Energy industries (renewable - / non-renewable sources)
Project Category: Renewable electricity in grid connected applications.
The project is a new grid-connected renewable wind power plant and not a grouped project as

1.8 Ownership
As stated in the (draft) Desaâa State Forest Management Plan 2018, the Desaâa forest is owned
and managed by the government of Ethiopia, specifically by the Ethiopian Environment, Forest
and Climate change (EECCC) Commission. Accordingly, the forest has been recognized and
registered as one of the National Forest Priority areas. Following this, in 1993 the boundary of
the forest area was demarcated by the Forest Inventory and Management Planning Division of
Forest and Wildlife Conservation and Development Department. For conservation and use
purposes, a management plan was prepared in 1997 by the initiative of the Tigray Regional State
Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Development (TBoARD).
The project proponent, WeForest and the Tigray State Government, through the Tigray Regional
State Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Development (TBoARD), have signed a MoU to develop this
ARR VCS project on these lands: âMemorandum of Understanding Between Tigray Regional State
Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Development and WeForest Ethiopiaâ.
The endorsement/agreement from the federal government/EECC is currently under negotiation.

The project has not been registered nor seeking registration under any other GHG program.
Projects Rejected by Other GHG Programs
The project has not been rejected by any other GHG program.
1.17 Other Forms of Credit

The project is not included in any other emission trading program.
Other Forms of Environmental Credit
The project has not sought or not received any other form of GHG-related environmental credits.
1.18 Additional Information Relevant to the Project
Leakage Management
The methodology applied refers to leakage due to activity shifting from inside the project area to outside
the project area as a result of the projectâs intervention. Two types of activity shifting are considered in
the methodology: cropland cultivation and grazing.
In the case of the Desaâa project area, activity shifting of cropland cultivation is not applicable. In the
baseline scenario there is no cultivation of cropland taking place inside the project area.
In Desaâa, 82% of households use the forest as a source of fodder. Grazing inside the forest is historically
one of the factors that has led to the degradation and disappearance of forest in the project area. This
was mainly caused by browsing, trampling of seedlings, and removing olive tree branches as fodder. The
importance of this driver of deforestation has however diminished in the baseline scenario for a number
of reasons.
- The major reason is that access to grass resources in the project area is arranged through a cut
and carry system, whereby grass is collected in the forest and brought to the cattle, based on
the agreements of communities for when to harvest grass.
- Zero grazing was introduced in 2006 in Tigray. By the time of the evaluation in 2011, its
adoption rate was still low. However, over the past couple of years there has been the
beginnings of an increase in zero grazing and the adoption of improved livestock, promoted by
the Tigray government. Free grazing in the Desaâa Forest is not allowed unless there is a
written permit â see forest example the Forest Proclamation1. Sometimes there are illegal
practices in some parts of the forest, mainly in the areas along the border between Tigray and
1 Forest Development, Conservation and Utilization Proclamation No. 1065/2018.

2.1 Project Goals, Design and Long-Term Viability
2.1.1 Summary Description of the Project (G1.2)
Zhangjiakou Zhangbei County 2017 Afforestation Project (hereafter refer to as âthe projectâ) is located in
Zhangbei county, Zhangjiakou City, Hebei Province of China. Hebei province is land locked and borders
Inner Mongolia to the northwest, Shanxi to the southwest, Liaoning to the east and Henan to the north. The
population of the province is 75.56 million. The project aims to plant native species on suitable land for
forest with low vegetative coverage rate for GHG removal whilst contributing to local sustainable
development goals.
20,750 ha (311,250Mu13) of the forest was planted on suitable lands for forest with low vegetative coverage
rate in Zhangbei county, which used to be poor sustainable ecological environment and rocky desertification.
Prior to the project, although the project area is suitable for planting trees, it lacks proper forestry
management, resulting in lower coverage of trees. Besides, there has never been any activity affecting the
local ecosystem in the project area14. By checking the afforestation plan, it was confirmed that, a small
number of trees existed in some project area before the project started, but the coverage rate was extremely
low. So, considering the lower forest coverage, Zhangbei Forestry Bureau determined that the project area
is suitable for afforestation after investigation, then the supplementary planting without disturbing the
existing trees was approved to increase the vegetative cover. All the trees were planted without disturbing
the existing trees in this report, and only the trees actually planted in this project were monitored. The
carbon credit of the original trees in the baseline scenario will not be monitored or counted in the actual net
GHG removals by sink.
The project involves Zhangbei county, with a total population of nearly 370,000. All these lands for
afforestation activities belong to the village committees. Zhangjiakou Sailin Landscaping Co., Ltd. (hereafter
referred to as Sailin Company) has been fully authorized by Zhangbei government, who represents all the
village committees, through a signed contract to act as the project proponent to implement project
management and monitoring, and to sell VCUs generated from the project so that Sailin Company
consolidate the offset resources into sizeable forestry offset projects. The implementation of the project
activity has provided 11,265 jobs for local villagers, it includes 11,200 temporary planting jobs and 65 long-
term technician jobs, among which 60 percent are women. The employment period of temporary planting
workers was during the planting period of the project, from 12 May 2017 to 15 July 2017.

G1.2)
In February 2015, the State of HawaiÊ»i Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) initiated the
Ola Hou â Restoring HawaiÊ»iâs Native Forests project. Project activities were implemented by the project
proponent in Nakula Natural Area Reserve (NAR) and Kahikinui Forest Reserve (FR) in Leeward
HaleakalÄ in the county and island of Maui (State of HawaiÊ»i), and include construction, expanding and
maintaining fence line, controlling and removing feral livestock and non-native ungulates, planting
native trees and plants, and monitoring and removing invasive species. Additional planting activity was
performed in partnership with the Leeward HaleakalÄ Watershed Restoration Partnership (LHWRP)
organization. The Nakula NAR and Kahikinui FR have been subjected to grazing by cattle, feral goats
and hogs for over 100 years12. Over this time, subject to this grazing pressure, the forest gave way to
non-native savannah grassland composed almost entirely of invasive grass species. Due to a large
population of feral ungulates and the steep terrain in this region, vegetation loss leading to erosion of
topsoil has led to further degradation and loss of carbon stocks from the project sites. By planting and
facilitating the natural regeneration via removal of feral ungulates, native woody species such as koa
(Acacia koa), Ê»ÅhiÊ»a (Metrosideros polymorpha), olopua (Nestegis sandwicensis), mamane (Sophora
chrysophylla), and pukiawe (Styphelia tameiameiae) are being restored, creating essential habitat for
rare native flora and fauna, and carbon is being sequestered. These project instances are expected to
remove an average of 287 t CO annually from the atmosphere over the project lifetime. 2

VCS Project Description
1.4 A brief description of the project:
The project activity is an initiative by Ms. Aishwarya Rai towards clean energy generation by
means of installation of 2 state-of-art WEGs of individual capacity 1.25 MW each, at village
Kotari near Soda Mada, District Jaisalmer in the State of Rajasthan aggregated to a total
installed capacity of 2.5MW.
The objective of the wind power project activity is to generate renewable electricity using
wind power resources and to sell the generated electricity to the State Electricity Utility
RVPNL (Rajasthan Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited).
The project activity is expected to generate 4899 MWh per annum. Had this amount of
electricity been produced by conventional fuel dominated power plants, it would lead to net
emission of 4439 tonnes of CO e per annum. Hence, Project Proponent (PP) decided to 2
harness renewable energy entailing to the establishment of these wind machines.
The generated electricity is being supplied to the RVPNL (herein after referred as Jaipur
DISCOM). The Rajasthan State grid forms part of the NEWNE Regional Grid of India (Since
August 2006, all regional grids except the Southern grid have been integrated and are
operating in synchronous mode, i.e. at same frequency. Consequently, the Northern, Eastern,
Western and North-Eastern grids are treated as a single grid and is being named as NEWNE
grid) which depends mainly on fossil fuels and this project activity contributes to reduced
greenhouse gas emissions caused by reliance on fossil fuels.

VCS Project Description
The nearest railway station is Jaisalmer Junction and the nearest airport is at Jaisalmer. The
airport is opened for flights only during tourist season.Nearest Highway is NH-15 (Jaisalmer
â Barmer).
1.6 Duration of the project activity/crediting period:
Project Start Date:
As per VCS 2007.1, the project start date shall not be before 1st January, 2002. The VCS
project activity start date is 30th September, 2004 which is the date on which the project
activity began reducing or removing GHG emissions i.e. the date of commissioning of both
the Turbines.
The VCS crediting Period will last for ten years starting from 1st April 2006 up to 31st
March 2016.
However, since the project is currently under CDM validation, it is to be noted that the
crediting period under VCS will last till the date of Registration of project under
CDM. Details are provided in section 1.13 of the PD below.
1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:
Electricity in Rajasthan is mainly generated from the fossil fuel dominated power plants (see
section 2.4 for details). In the absence of the project activity, equivalent amount of electricity
would have been generated by the operation of fossil fuel dominated power plants. The
electricity grid is power deficit and hence the new capacity has to be added in the grid system
which would be fossil fuel dominated electricity generation.
PP has installed the project activity at a location which is a barren land and there is no
agriculture activity being undertaken at this site. There is neither any industrial activity
undertaken nor any human displacement done at the site because of the project activity.
The purpose of the present project activity is to harness renewable resources in the region,
and thereby displacing non- renewable natural resources and ultimately leading to sustainable
economic and environmental development. The project activity includes development,
design, engineering, procurement, finance, construction, operation and maintenance of wind
energy based electric generating stations supplying electricity to the RVPNL grid.
1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG
emission reductions and/or removal enhancements:
The project activity is a Greenfield wind power project activity with a totalled installed
capacity of 2.5 MW and is expected to generate 4899 MWh per annum. The electricity thus
generated is sold to the Jaipur DISCOM. In the absence of the project activity, equivalent
amount of electricity would have been generated by the operation of existing/proposed grid
connected fossil fuel dominated power plants. The Project activity will thus reduce the

2.2 Applicability of Methodology
The methodology is applicable for project activities that avoid greenhouse gases emissions by
using renewable biomass in order to generate thermal energy. In addition, the methodology is
applicable if the project generates less than 45MW of energy, which is accomplished by the
project as it generates 6.98 MW.
There are no similar registered project activities in the region of the project activity once
Sustainable Carbon - Projetos Ambientais LTDA made a research and did not find any registered
small-scale CDM Project. Therefore, the proposed project activity is not saving the non-renewable
biomass accounted for by the other registered project activities.
The utilization of firewood from areas without any kind of management cannot be considered a
renewable source of biomass, since it interferes in the carbon pools and increases the carbon
emissions to the atmosphere, turning greenhouse effect even worse. Moreover, the native wood
provided from areas without a reforestation management plan does not fit any of the options of
UNFCCC definition of renewable biomass in Annex 18, EB 2320.
Firewood coming from reforestation activities is considered renewable according to option I of the
UNFCCC definition of renewable biomass (Annex 18, EB 23), as it fits all the assumptions below:
âThe biomass is originating from land areas that are forests21 where:
(a) The land area remains a forest; and
(b) Sustainable management practices are undertaken on these land areas to ensure, in
particular, that the level of carbon stocks on these land areas does not systematically decrease
over time (carbon stocks may temporarily decrease due to harvesting); and
(c) Any national or regional forestry and nature conservation regulations are complied with.â

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
Heilongjiang Zhaoyuan Improved Agricultural Land Management Project (hereinafter referred to
as âthe projectâ) is located in Zhaoyuan County, Daqing City, Heilongjiang Province, China. The
purpose of the project is to adopt improved agricultural land management practices to prevent
the severe soil degradation caused by pre-existing conventional tillage in local crop land.
The improved agricultural land management practices of the project focus on no-tillage on fields
evenly mulched with crushed straw for two or three years, followed by plowing or subsoiling once
and continued no-tillage for another two or three years. No-tillage can effectively reduce the
loosening of the surface soil layer and soil disturbance, reduce the loss of water and nutrients in
the soil, ensure the retention of organic matter in the soil, reduce the degree of compaction of
the tillage equipment on the tillage soil layer, and preserve appropriate space for the growth of
crops, which is convenient for ventilation and keeps the soil with good water storage capacity.
The application of no-tillage sowing has solved the problem of sand blowing in bare farmland to
a certain extent and played a role in windbreak and sand fixation. No-tillage can maximize the
protective effect of straw mulching on soil.
The project plans to implement improved agricultural land management practices in 87,479 ha
corn field in the first crediting period to increase soil organic carbon (SOC). The project proponent
not only introduced more efficient and appropriate tillage method with Zhaoyuan Agriculture and
Rural Affairs Bureau (ZARAB) to the farmers, but also provide technical training and support to
the farmers.
The scenario existing prior to the projectâs implementation is primarily conventional tillage with
straw mulching, which increase soil disturbance and the loss of soil organic matter (SOM).
During the first crediting period from 07-Apr-2021 to 06-Apr-2031, the project is expected to
generate GHG emission removals of 1,315,100 tCO e, with an average annual GHG emission 2
removal of 131,510 tCO e. 2

1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
1.10.1 Climate:
Weather data collected at La Milpa Field Station on the north-western Rio Bravo Conservation and
Management Area (but outside the defined Project Area) has provided a good estimate of weather
patterns. Since conditions alter across the Rio Bravo, those in the south and east can be assessed from
observations from the weather stations at Tower Hill (near Orange Walk Town) and Spanish Lookout.
Overall the area experiences a sub-tropical moist climate with marked wet and dry seasons, dominated
by weather systems moving through the Gulf of Mexico and western Caribbean. The wet season is May â
November and the dry season is December to April. Temperatures are fairly constant across inland
northern Belize, averaging 27o C (81oF), but rainfall increases from north-west to south-east. Thus mean
annual rainfall at La Milpa over the period 1995-2005 has been 1239 mm (49â) while that at Tower Hill is
somewhat higher (1353 mm, 53â) and Spanish Lookout is higher again (1546 mm, 61â). These data
suggest that the eastern RBCMA should receive 1440-1500 mm (57-59â) per annum. The La Milpa
rainfall and that estimated for the eastern RBCMA is rather lower than those given in previous
descriptions of the area. This conforms to a slight drying trend over the past decade (Meerman &
Cherrington, 2005).

100% of the respondents have some knowledge and understandings about wind farm projects. 
100% of the respondents do not disagree with the devel opment of the Project. About 87% of them believe 
that the Project will have overall positive impacts, such as âincrease of job opportunities and incomeâ, 
âimprovement of living standardâ, on their livelihoods, while the others believe there will be little impact 
on their livelihoods or do not know the impacts.  Among the negative impacts mentioned, the main con cerns are infield occupation and plants damage 
(81%),  noise (19%), waste water and electro-magnetism pollution (6%).  The main additional comment or suggestion on the Project construction is âaccelerate the construction 
process and generation as soon as possibleâ, which reflected the support from the stakeholders. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The survey shows that the proposed project receiv es strong support from local people, which is closely 
linked to the fact that the majority of local village rs have some understandings with wind power projects. 
Most of the respondents believe that the project will have overall positive impacts on their livelihoods 
with better standard of living and reduced tariff which is quite high now. Among the negative impacts, 
the two main issues concerned are land use and envi ronmental pollution. However, as the environmental 
impact assessment demonstrates, both impacts only occur during construction period, and accompanied by mitigating measures such as enclosed operation, w aste landfill, and restored vegetation, the impacts 
will be minimized after the construction.  The survey forms are ava ilable from the company.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
Winsome Textile Industries Ltd. (hereinafter also called as WTIL), a leading manufacturer of
textile product, started its operations in 1980 in Baddi, Himanchal Pradesh, India. WTIL has
given special stress to minimise contamination, both at pre-spinning and post-spinning stages
by adding machines like Vision Shield in Blow Room and Schlafhorst-338 with LOEPFE - 9001
(SIRO CLEANER) Contamination Control Channel at winding stage. Further addition was to
generate renewable electricity for captive consumption to minimise carbon foot print in long
term.
The project activity involves power generation from a 3.5 MW hydroelectric project based on
Manuni Khad stream, a tributary of river Beas at village Khaniara, Dharamshala, District
Kangra, Himachal Pradesh. The project activity is a run-of-river project being developed by
M/s Winsome Textile Industries Ltd. The project activity comprises 2 Numbers of Pelton
Turbines each with a generator output capacity of 1750 kW for generation of electricity.
The project was allotted to the M/s Winsome Textile Industries Ltd. on a Build, Own, Operate
and Maintain (BOOM) basis for a period of 40 years. Wheeling and Banking Agreement (PPA)
is being signed with the Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board (HPSEB), the generated
electricity will be used for captive consumption at its manufacturing unit Baddi.
The purpose of the project activity is to produce renewable energy using hydro power for
captive consumption. In the absence of the project activity equivalent amount of electricity
would have been generated by the operation of grid connected fossil fuel based power plants.
The Project activity thus reduces the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs)
in to the atmosphere associated with the equivalent amount of electricity generation from the
fossil fuel based grid connected power plant. The project activity has commissioned both the
turbine on 31/03/2017.
The estimated annual average and the total CO e emission reduction by the project activity 2
over the first renewable crediting period of 10 years are expected to be 17,619 tCO e and 2
176190 tCO e respectively. 2

VCS Project Description
In the absence of the project activity, an equivalent quantum of electricity would have
been generated by the fossil-fuel dominated Southern Regional Electricity Grid of
India6 generation mix. The same would in turn result in GHG emissions at the grid
end as per the carbon intensity of the above mentioned grid. This scenario has been
identified as the baseline scenario for the project activity under consideration (please
refer to section 2.4 of the VCS PD for further details).
1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG emission reductions
and/or removal enhancements:
The project activity under consideration entails electricity generation through wind-
mills by harnessing wind power potential, a natural and renewable source of energy.
The project is expected to generate and export of 20.965 million kWh (approx) per
year to the Southern Regional Grid of India. In the absence of the project activity, an
equivalent quantity of electricity would have been generated by the Southern Grid by
a majority of fossil-fuel fired power plants. The same would have resulted in GHG
emissions as per the carbon intensity of the grid-mix.
As per the combined margin carbon intensity of the 0.928 tCO /MWh for the 2
Southern Grid, the bundled project activity would there by result in total CO emission 2
reduction of 194560 tonnes over the crediting period of 10 years. For detailed
calculation procedure and sample calculation tables of the GHG emission reduction
quantum from the project activity, please refer to Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of the
VCS PD.
1.9 Project technologies, products, services and the expected level of activity:
In wind energy generation, kinetic energy of wind blowing at high speeds is
converted into mechanical energy while passing through the wind-turbine. The
rotation of the turbine blades results in the rotation of the generator mounted on the
same shaft, thus generating electricity. As there are no GHG emissions associated
with wind electricity generation, the technology is widely recognized as clean
technology. An upwind7 Horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT)8 is used in the project
activity to generate power.
o Main Tower: This is what holds the windmill up into the airflow.
o Blades: The blades are basically the sails of the system. They are flat
objects connected to the centre shaft that converts the push of the
wind into a circular motion. When the wind forces the blades to move,
it has transferred some of its energy to the rotor
6 The Indian power grid system (or the National Grid) is divided into two regional grids namely NEWNE Regional Grid
and Southern Region Grid. These regional grids have independent state Load Dispatch Centres (LDCs) that manage
flow of power in their jurisdiction. Power generated by state owned generation units and private owned generation
units is consumed by the respective states. Power generated by central sector plants is shared by all states forming
part of the grid in a fixed proportion.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice
cultivation is conducted in Anlu City within Xiaogan City, Hubei Province of China, with a total
acreage of 13,298 ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project,
which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded
method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded
method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition
can emit a large amount of methane (CH ) because of anaerobic decomposition, the 4
intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase
and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.
This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results
in not only large amount of methane (CH ) emissions but also low rice productivity by 4
replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens
the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH emission 4
can be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an
estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 4.32tCO e/ha for single-cropping rice is 2
expected. Annual average estimation of GHG emission reductions from the project activity
is 57,504 tCO e/year, and the total GHG emission reductions are 575,040 tCO e during the 2 2
fixed 10 years crediting period.
This project aims to:
ï· Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;
ï· Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;
ï· Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers;
ï· Increase in the number of individuals with improved capacity due to diversified
educational opportunities from Trainings.

According to the requirements of Chinese environmental protection laws and regulationsï¼there
is a Statement for Environmental Impact Assessment of the project released by Heishan
Environmental Protection Bureau. The Statement ensures that:
The proposed project does no harm to the local environment, and it is not included in the
categories9 that need Environmental Impact Assessment, it doesnât need an Environmental
Impact Assessment. The local Environmental Bureau also gave a document to prove the
significant positive environment impacts.
In addition to reducing the GHG emissions, the proposed project also has positive environment
impacts. With the biogas digester constructed in households, animal manure management system
can be improved, the environment in the pigpen and latrine can be improved and the odour can
be reduced. With the new pigpen and latrine, less disease on human and animal will be caused
and transmitted by bacterial and virus. And all the manure is fed into the tank, which will reduce
pollution to soil and water caused by direct discharge of animal waste. Using biogas for cooking
is good for improving indoor air condition. Cooking with coal produces a large amount of SO , 2
CO and smoke, which is harmful to humanâs health. But cooking with CH ,only producing H O 4 2
and CO , is environmental friendly. In general, the environmental impacts are: 2
ï¬ GHG emissions being strongly mitigated in comparison to baseline treatment alternative;
ï¬ The environment and odour in pigpen and latrine being improved;
ï¬ Improving the indoor air condition, protecting human from SO ,CO,smoke; 2
ï¬ Avoiding pollution to soil and water caused by direct discharge of animal waste.
ï¬ Using biogas slurry instead of traditional non-fermented animal manure. The process of
generating biogas will kill many of the pathogenic bacteria found in manure that can be passed on
to humans causing intestinal diseases.
As indicated above, the proposed project can improve the rural environment and living
conditions in the project areas while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. No significant negative
environment impacts have been identified Heishan Environment Protection Bureau approved the
proposed project on December 10, 2007.
