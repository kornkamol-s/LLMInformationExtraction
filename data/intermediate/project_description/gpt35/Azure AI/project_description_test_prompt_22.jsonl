A total of 8,774 households (38,255 farmers) were involved in\nthe project. Without the project, local villagers would not have access to\nintermittently flooded technology and intact facilities to conduct the\nintermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously flooded method\nwould be continued. The original scenario in which rice was cultivated by the\ncontinuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Due to the anaerobic\ndecomposition of organic matter in the paddy soil under flooded conditions, a\nlarge amount of methane can be released, so the intermittently flooded\nmethod is more conducive to water efficiency, improving rice yield and\nreducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.\nThe implementation activities of the project include promoting intermittently\nflooded technology, technical training for the farmers, facility repair and\nreplacement, etc. According to the needs of rice growth, farmers use pumps\nand valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water\nresources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under\nanaerobic conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can\nbe supplied to the rice paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water\ncan be drained from the rice paddies in the rainy season.\nThe project is expected to reduce GHG emissions by 416,423 tCO2e in the first\nseven-year period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 59,489\ntCO2e.

The project proponent is\nCKBV Florestal Ltda (CKBV or \u201cthe company\u201d), a Brazilian private and family company whose main\nbusiness is the management and commercialization of native wood. CKBV is part of CIKEL group,\nwhich has been working in forest management in the Brazilian Amazon since 1977.\nDue to difficulties in its commercial wood business in 2005 and 2006, which had a negative financial\nimpact on the company, in 2006 CKBV decided to diversify its business beyond wood products. The\ndiversification alternative chosen was livestock, and to pursue this new business activity CKBV had\ninitiated plans to legally convert (suppress) 20% of its forest property in the Rio Capim Complex to\npasture.\nThe main activity of the CIKEL Brazilian Amazon REDD APD Project is the cancelation of the planned\ndeforestation activities and decision to instead conserve the forest area and continue limited forest\nmanagement activities in the area under Forest Stewardship Council\u00ae Certification (FSC\u00ae) with Low\nImpact Logging (SFMLIL) practices. Also, the company is intensifying and improving its practices to\nsupport the sustainable social development, maintaining and improving the biodiversity monitoring at\nthe RCC in the framework of FCS certification and REDD activities.\nThe financial incentives from the sale of VCUs permit the project activity to be competitive with\nalternative business scenarios like livestock and allow CKBV to cancel its legal forest conversion\nplans and maintain its forest management activities.\nThe project is located at the Rio Capim Complex (RCC), Paragominas municipality, in Para State, in\nthe Eastern Amazon. The RCC property includes five forest areas: Rio Capim, Poty, Cauaxi, Sumal\nand Cacul\u00e9, totaling 209,130.54 ha. The project area is a subset of the RCC property and covers an\narea of 27,434.9 ha of native forest.\nFrom the implementation of this REDD Project, it is estimated that 9,432,299 tonnes of carbon dioxide\nemissions will be avoided which would have been emitted into the atmosphere in a period of 10 years\nin the absence of the project, not including the project\u2019s non-permanence risk buffer contribution.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nProject Scope 14: Agriculture, Forest and other Land Use (AFOLU)\nProject Category: Reduction Emission from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD)\nType of Activity: Avoided Planned Deforestation (APD)\n4\n\n[['', 'Entity', '', '', '33 Forest Capital', ''], ['Role', None, None, 'Financial and Technical partner for the next 10-year', None, None], ['Responsible', None, None, 'Ivana Cepon', None, None], ['Address', None, None, 'Burgemeester van Karnebeeklaan 17\\n2585 BA The Hague, The Netherlands', None, None], ['Contact', None, None, 'Phone +31 70 3461734\\nicepon@33assetmngt.com', None, None]]\n[['', 'Entity', '', '', 'TerraCarbon LLC', ''], ['Role', None, None, 'Technical lead on development of VCS PD', None, None], ['Responsible', None, None, 'David Shoch', None, None], ['Address', None, None, '5901 N.

CORANTIOQUIA: Based on Article 49 of the law 99 of 1993 and article 3 of the decree 1220 of\n2005 the project requires an environmental license to construct and operate the project.\nSince the project has less than 100 MW, based on Article 52 of law 99 and article 8 of decree\n1220, the corresponding Regional Autonomous Corporation (in this case CORANTIOQUIA) is\nresponsible to control and supervise compliance of the project with the requirements established\nin the EIA and the environmental license. (For more information on the environmental license\nprocess, see section 5).\n2. UPME: It acts as a supervisory entity. Any project to be implemented and interconnected with the\nelectricity grid needs to be registered at the UPME. There are several phases, although the only\nmandatory registration step is called \u201cPhase IV\u201d, which is emitted upon final project design and\nthe emission of the environmental license.\n3. XM Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Expertos en Mercados S.A. E.S.P.: this is the grid administrator and\noperator. The entity that will buy the energy has also to be subscribed to XM and meet all\napplicable laws.\n4. CREG: As the regulating entity, the CREG assures that all regulatory requirements are met. It\nalso measures annually the capacity of the power plants, for instance to guarantee that minor\nplants are below the net generation capacity of 20 MW at the interconnection point.\nSince the project is being constructed and operated in a highly regulated market that is controlled by a\nseries of public and private actors, compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements is\nsupervised and can be guaranteed.\n1.12 Ownership and Other Programs\n1.12.1 Right of Use\nThe proof of title is given by the environmental license assigned to Generadora Luzma S.A.

{"input":"Question: What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?\n\nContext: \n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\n1 PROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nCore CarbonX Solutions Private Limited (CCX) is a carbon management consultancy company with\nregistered office in the state of Telangana. CCX is the Project Proponent (PP) of the carbon offset project\ncalled \u201cBan Odisha01\u201d in all districts of Odisha. The carbon credit rights is transferred to CCX which in\nturn will share the carbon revenue to farmers on realisation of carbon credits. The individual farmers are\nthe owners of the lands on which trees are being grown to sequester carbon and reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions from the atmosphere. CCX has mobilized the farmers in the selected states of India to plant\nvarious tree species on their lands. These tree species range from fruit bearing trees like Indian\nblackberry, Guava, Mango, lemon to commercial species like cashew, arjuna, asana, teak, mahogany,\netc. Simple tree cultivation techniques involving planting saplings in the pits with minimum disturbance\nto the lands have been employed by the selected farmers.\nThe villages under the project area predominantly have an agrarian economy where most of its population\ndepends on agriculture. The condition prior to the project initiation was barren land or agriculture as\nmaize, chili, pulses and paddy or other commercial crops were grown by the farmers on their farmlands\nwith limited agroforestry species. The planation was done by the farmers and utilized the subsidies to\navail the saplings. The saplings do the sequestration of carbon dioxide at faster pace and ultimately\nreduces GHG emissions.\nThe Project Activity will lead to considerable carbon sequestration in the project areas and will contribute\nstrongly to the sustainable development of rural villages involved in the project.\nThe project quantifies the GHG removals occurring from agroforestry plantations through the use of AR-\nACM0003: \u201cAfforestation and reforestation project activities implemented on lands other than wetlands\u201d,\nVersion 02.0 developed under the Clean Development Mechanism for large-scale plantations. The project\nplans to generate carbon credits for the voluntary market under the VCS standard. Such planting activity\nwould result in carbon credits that would be sold in the carbon market to generate revenue. As per the\nCarbon-offset agreement entered into between the farmers and CCX, 60%-80 of the carbon income\ngenerated from the sale of carbon credits would be distributed among the farmers. The project activity\nwas implemented in 1900 hectares. Through carbon sequestration by the planted trees, the project is\nexpected to generate annual average GHG emission reductions or removals of 15671 tCO2e.\nThe selected farmers are those farmers who did not plant anything on their lands as they were fallow\nlands. CCX company held workshops in the villages and advised the villagers to grow certain types of fruit\nand commercial trees in a sustainable manner to earn carbon revenue. The idea of earning additional\nrevenue caught the farmers attention and they decided to enter into carbon-offset agreements with the\nCCX company.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nSectoral Scope: 14: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)\nType of activity: Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR).\n4\n\n[['Organization name', None, None, '', 'Core CarbonX Solutions Private Limited', ''], ['Contact person', None, None, '', 'Mr. Niroj Kumar Mohanty', ''], ['Title', None, None, '', 'Managing Director', ''], ['Address', None, None, '', '5R, Block \u2018A\u2019, Kanthi Shikara Complex, 6-3-668\/9, Punjagutta,', ''], [None, None, None, None, 'Hyderabad \u2013 500082, Telangana, India', None], ['', 'Telephone', '', '', '+919908387772', ''], ['', 'Email', '', '', 'nmohanty@corecarbonx.com; info@corecarbonx.com', '']]\n[['', 'Organization name', '', '', 'NA', ''], ['', 'Role in the project', '', '', 'NA', ''], ['', 'Contact person', '', '', 'NA', ''], ['', 'Title', '', '', 'NA', ''], ['', 'Address', '', '', 'NA', ''], ['', 'Telephone', '', '', 'NA', '']]\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nThe project is a not a grouped project\n1.3 Project Eligibility\nThe project is eligible under the scope of the VCS Program as the project includes AFOLU activities (project\ncategory ARR), which are supported by a methodology approved under the VCS Program.

The total installed\ncapacity of 21.6 MW comprises of 12 WTGs, each with a capacity of 1.80 MW. The project\nprovides electricity to the state of Gujarat by effective utilization of renewable resources. The\ntechnology has been supplied by Vestas. The project utilizes wind energy for exporting electricity\nwhich otherwise would have been generated through alternate fuels (most likely - fossil fuel)\nbased power plants, contributing to reduction in specific emissions (emissions of pollutant)\nincluding GHG emissions. Electricity produced from the project activity is supplied to NEWNE\n(Now Indian grid) grid of India.\nEmission reductions are claimed on the net electrical energy that is supplied to grid which is\nmetered using meters located at the electrical yard of the respective WTGs. These electrical\nenergy meters are electronic tri-vector meters of appropriate accuracy class. Since these meters\nare not designed to measure high voltages and currents as generated in the WTG, the WTG output\nis connected to these meters via transformers (CT\/PT) for stepping down the generated voltage\nand current to ranges which the meters can record. As such, these meters have a multiplying\nfactor which when multiplied to the meter reading provides the actual amount of electricity\ngenerated. The technology providers for the project have additionally installed an LCS meter at\nthe WTG controller.\nThe electricity generated is monitored using electrical meters which provide a measure of the\nactual electrical energy that would have been sourced from a fossil-fuel based power plants in\nthe absence of the project activity. Hence, the fossil-fuel power based grid is the baseline for the\nproject activity. The annual GHG emission reductions from project activity is estimated to be\n52,108 tCO e. Thus the proposed project activity leads to an emission reduction of 521,080 2\ntCO e over the chosen crediting period of ten years 2\nThe project is a Greenfield wind power project and does not involve generation of GHG emissions\nfor the purpose of their subsequent reduction, removal or destruction. Thus prior to project\ninitiation, there was nothing at site. In absence of project activity, the continuation of current\npractice i.e. generation of equivalent amount electricity would have been generated from grid\nconnected fossil fuel dominated power plants. Thus for project activity baseline scenario is\nelectricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by\nthe operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources.\nThe total emission reductions achieved by this project activity in the monitoring period from 01-\nJanuary-2021 to 31-December-2021, are 41,683 tCO e through displacing 44,623.91 MWh of 2\nelectricity from fossil-fuel dominated electricity grid with electricity generation using wind energy\nresources.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nSectoral Scope 1: Energy Industries (renewable\/non- renewable sources)\nProject type : Renewable energy project (wind)\nThe project activity is not a grouped project.\n4\n\n[['Organization name', None, None, '', 'Powerica Limited', ''], ['Contact person', None, None, '', 'Mr. Pradeep Gupta', ''], ['', 'Title', '', '', 'Head - Wind Energy Division', ''], ['', 'Address', '', '', '9th Floor, Godrej Coliseum, Sion (E) Mumbai \u2013 400022, Maharashtra, India', ''], ['', 'Telephone', '', '', '+ 91 22 4001 2000', ''], ['', 'Email', '', '', 'pradeep.gupta@powericaltd.com', '']]\n[['Organization name', None, None, '', 'EKI Energy Services Limited', ''], ['Role in the project', None, None, '', 'Project Consultant', ''], ['Contact person', None, None, '', 'Shital Patil', ''], ['', 'Title', '', '', 'Executive', ''], ['Address', 'Address', None, '', 'Office No 201, Plot No 48, Scheme 78, Vijay Nagar Part- II, Indore 452010,', ''], [None, None, None, None, 'India', None], ['', 'Telephone', '', '', '+91-7972836470', ''], ['', 'Email', '', '', 'shital@enkingint.org\/ registry@enkingint.org', '']]\nJoint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.1\n1.3 Project Eligibility\nThe project activity involves installation and generation of electricity using wind energy resources\ni.e. by using the renewable sources replacing electricity supply from a fossil-fuel dominated\nelectricity, thus leads to reductions of anthropogenic GHG emissions from atmosphere.

This\nwould result in GHG emissions as per the carbon intensity of the grid-mix. This situation has\nbeen identified as the baseline scenario for the project activity in Section 2.4 of this\ndocument.\n1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG emission reductions and\/or\nremoval enhancements:\nThe project involves generation of electrical energy using wind, a renewable source of\nenergy. The project activity will generate 10,512 MWh of of net electricity annually at a Plant\nLoad Factor (PLF) of 20% and export the same to the Integrated NEWNE Grid, mainly\npowered by the fossil fuel fired power plants. The electricity generation from this project will\ncontribute to corresponding GHG emission reductions to the tune of 9,439 tCO e\/year. 2\n1.9 Project technologies, products, services and the expected level of activity:\nIn wind energy generation, kinetic energy of wind is converted into mechanical energy and\nsubsequently into electrical energy. Wind has considerable amount of kinetic energy when\nblowing at high speeds.

PROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nHeishan LN1 Household Biogas Project in Heishan Jinzhou, Liaoning Province (the project) is\nlocated in Heishan County, Jinzhou City, Liaoning Province, and P.R. China. The project is\ndesigned to construct methane recovery and utilization system for each rural household of 13,104\nin total. According to the construction plan, the construction is conducted in steps and phases.\n3,429 household biogas digesters installation are carried out in 2008; 5,675 household biogas\ndigesters are installed in 2009; the remaining 4,000 biogas digesters installation are constructed\nin 2010. The construction is strictly based on National Standard GB\/T4750-2002 for biogas\ndigester and GB\/T 3606-2001 for biogas stove. The main objective of the Project is to dispose the\nraw manure from pigs by anaerobic digester with a volume of 8m3, and to collect biogas\ngenerated during the treatment process for thermal supply which meets the cooking and water\nheating demands of the rural household itself by biogas stove with a thermal flow of 3.26kW each\none. Before implementing the Project, all the manure would be left to decay in the uncovered\nanaerobic mature management system, i.e. deep pit with depth of 1meter at least; the methane\ngenerated would be emitted to the atmosphere. In addition, the heat would in the absence of the\nproject activity be generated by stove fired with fossil fuels1, which is stated in the investigation\nreport on rural household biogas utilization by Heishan County on September, 2007. The\nscenario in the absence of the project activity is identical to the baseline scenario.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nSectoral scope 1: Energy (renewable\/non-renewable)\nSectoral scope 15: Livestock and manure management\n1.3 Project Proponent\nThe project developer, Beijing Rural Well-off Economy &Technology Development Center is the\nsole Project Proponent.

Without the implementation of this\nproject, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously\nflooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously\nflooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded\ncondition can emit a large amount of methane (CH ) because of anaerobic decomposition, 4\nthe intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase\nand methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results\nin not only large amount of methane (CH ) emissions but also low rice productivity by 4\nreplacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens\nthe period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH emission 4\ncan be declined by an average of 48%1 .

To achieve this we have been solidifying our relationship for the past year with the different\nassociations of producers as well as the individual producers. Our structure is composed of 4\ngroup.\n1. ECOTIERRA\n2. CENTRALES (grouping of cooperatives) and other partners\n3. COOPERATIVE (We are partnered with 32 cooperatives in the development of this\nproject.)\n4. Small producers of coffee and cocoa associated with our partner cooperatives.\nCooperatives are organizations whose members are individual small producers whom mainly\nproduce coffee and cocoa. They may be small in size (regrouping 40-50 members) or large in\nscale (regrouping 4,000 members). The main purpose of the cooperatives is to market the crop\nproduction of its members. The majority of the cooperatives have Organic and Fair Trade\ncertification and encourages all of its members to adopt these practices. Some cooperatives also\nassist their members by providing some training and field technicians. Their expertise is key in\nthe development and the management of the project.\nRoles and responsibilities: The cooperatives are responsible for the planting activities such as\nthe selections of the plots, the planting, the monitoring of the project including the sustainable\nhusbandry and commercialization of the trees. In the monitoring process they are responsible for\nmonitoring the integration of new plots (new instances) of the project, by onsite visits and surveys\nto the producers. The cooperatives will also have the responsibility to monitor the implementation\nof the project activities. For more details, see section 4 (monitoring).\nCentrales were created by the grouping of smaller cooperatives whose main objective was to\nreach critical mass for exporting their products. They specialize in the direct marketing and\nexporting of the crop. Within the organizational structure sometimes can be found other types of\npartners: Cooperatives that are not regrouped and an NGO.\nRoles and responsibilities:\nThe Centrals have a role of support, training and monitoring activities. The project partners can\nbe found in the table below. In the monitoring process centrales will assume the role of first\nverification and quality assurance of the monitoring of the cooperatives. For more details, see\nsection 4 (monitoring).\nv3.2 5\n\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n1.12 Ownership and Other Programs\n1.12.1 Right of Use\nAs part of the participation requirements, all produces participating on the project must provide a\ndocument of right of use (a legal title of property). According to the forestry law the landholder is\nthe owner of the trees planted and have the right of use on GHG removal. This means that the\nlandowner is the owner of the carbon pools as well.

The instances must be\nunder threat of planned deforestation for conversion to agricultural activities as defined under\nVM0007 at the time the project proponent took ownership of the project area.\nThe project starts with only one instance but this number is expected to grow with time. The\ninstance is located in the department of Beni, 90 km west of Riberalta and forms part of the\nAmazon Rain Forest. The project area is home to species listed in the red book as vulnerable\nand endangered such as Cedrela Odorata: Bertholletia excelsa, Amburana cearencis. The project\nhas suffered in the past to some degree or other from selective logging, deforestation for\nagricultural purposes and deforestation resulting from human induced fires.\nIn protecting the forest, the project will pay special attention to endangered and vulnerable tree\nspecies native to the region while ensuring that the communities surrounding the project areas do\nnot suffer the full impact of job losses associated with forest preservation. In addition to\nprotecting the forests in the project areas, the project will enrich the project areas with\nendangered and vulnerable tree species. The prevention of deforestation will lead to the loss of\nemployment opportunities.

In this region we find the natural habitat of endangered animal species such as the black caiman (Melanosuchus Niger), the harpy eagle (Harpy Eagle) and the giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) as well as habitat for forest species of economic importance as chestnut (bertholletia excelsa). Currently, Madre de Dios faces an abrupt change in land use and accelerated forest degradation; historically, this same region was characterized by low levels of deforestation, so that the impact generated, affects the well-preserved status of this area. This change may be a result of the construction of the South Inter-Oceanic Highway, which generated greater accessibility and therefore increased immigration. In this scenario, we need to add up the advancement of informal gold mining, fueled by the rising price of gold, whose mode of extraction is highly polluting and causing deforestation in areas adjacent to the rivers of the region.The project will be developed in the Native Community of Ese'Eja Infierno and its Ecotourism Concession located in Madre de Dios, these areas belong politically to the province of Tambopata, Tambopata District, adding a total area of 7749.94 hectares. The purpose of the project is to conserve community forests and their concession, against de rapidly increase of deforestation. The project proposes to reduce the pressure to change the use of land in the project area through the promotion of sustainable economic activities, forest governance and the establishment of conservation agreements on critical areas previously identified. These actions are intended to avoid the expansion of agriculture; to achieve them, permanent coordination and alliances will be made with institutions that currently are conducting conservation activities in the area.Also, the control and monitoring system of the community and its concession will be strengthened, emphasizing on the formation and operation of forest guards, which have an official recognition of the Regional Directorate of Forestry and Wildlife of Madre de Dios, which represents a strategy of community involvement.With these actions, the project hopes to avoid annual average net emissions of 117,676.00 tCO2-e. in the referenced scenario during the first 10 years period, in which, because of migration and occupation of the land that promotes the operation of the South Interoceanic Highway, an average of 289.76 ha per year will be deforested.The project includes benefits for the concerned people and the conservation of biodiversity, beyond the benefits of reducing GHG emissions.
