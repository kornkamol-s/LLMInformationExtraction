So, the\nproject start date was 30-March-20182 when the land preparation was started.\n1.9 Project Crediting Period\nThe crediting period of this project will be using a 7-year, twice renewable crediting period, for a\ncombined total project crediting 21 years from 30-March-2018 to 29-March-2039, and the first\n2 The earliest start date of rice cropping season among farmers which are recorded in the Farmers\u2019 database.\n7\n\n[['', 'Project Scale', None, None, None, ''], ['', 'Project', '', '', '\u221a', ''], ['', 'Large project', '', '', '', '']]\n[['Year', None, None, '', 'Estimated GHG emission', ''], [None, None, None, None, 'reductions or removals (tCO e)\\n2', None], ['', '30-March-2018 to 31-December-', '', '58,791', None, None], [None, '20184', None, None, None, None], ['', '01-January-2019 to 31-', '', '58,791', None, None], [None, 'December-2019', None, None, None, None], ['', '01-January-2020 to 31-', '', '58,791', None, None], [None, 'December-2020', None, None, None, None], ['', '01-January-2021 to 31-', '', '58,791', None, None], [None, 'December-2021', None, None, None, None], ['', '01-January-2022 to 31-', '', '58,791', None, None], [None, 'December-2022', None, None, None, None], ['', '01-January-2023 to 31-', '', '58,791', None, None], [None, 'December-2023', None, None, None, None], ['', '01-January-2024 to 31-', '', '58,791', None, None], [None, 'December-2024', None, None, None, None], ['', '01-January-2025 to 29-March-', '', '0', None, None], [None, '20255', None, None, None, None]]\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\n7-year period is from 30-March-2018 to 29-March-2025.

The design lifetime of the ditches in this project is 30 years, so the project\nlifetime is 30 years. The project's lifetime starts from the date the ditches are completed, so the start date of the project lifetime is earlier\nthan the project's start date.\n4 Section 3.8 of the VCS Standard, v4.2 states that \u201cThe project crediting period is the time for which GHG emission reductions or removals\ngenerated by the project are eligible for issuance as VCUs.\u201d According to the Methodology of Methane emission reduction by adjusted water\nmanagement practice in rice cultivation, the time when the project produces emission reductions is the start time of land preparation. And\nthe land preparation means the start of a rice season. The main activity of this project is emission reduction due to the adjusted water\nregime during rice cultivation, which means emission reduction for each year only occurred thought the rice-growing season. Therefore,\nalthough the crediting period in 2018 does not start from 1st January, it has already included the whole rice-growing season in a year.\n5 The rice planting starts on 30-March-2025, with no emission reduction during the non-planting period, so there will be no emission\nreductions from 01-January-2025 to 29-March-2025.\n8\n\n\n[['Ecosystems', \"Ledong County has precious protected animals Hainan Eld's\\ndeer and Hainan black-crowned gibbon, which are mainly\\ndistributed in Jianfengling and Bawangling.

Resources to satisfy these needs are not readily available outside of\nwhat the forest provides due to a lack of economic opportunities in the area. The forest provides an array\nof raw materials that can be processed into goods and sold to make a living or pay for expenses not\nprovided for directly by the forest. The forest communities depend nearly exclusively on the forest\nprocesses which bring about materials and sustenance that are essential for survival in the region. These\nattributes indicate that HCV 5 is present in the project zone.\n1.3.7.1.6 Cultural Identity (HCV 6)\nThe project zone includes areas that are critical for the traditional cultural identity of the communities that\nlive there. Each village system designates forest areas that are allocated as \u201cspirit forests\u201d that exist\nwithin the project zone. The size and location of these spiritual and religious spaces varies between\nvillages, but commonly most rural populations draw spiritual and cultural connections from the forest and\nthe plants and animals which exist there. These connections are formative in traditional practices and\nbeliefs, cultural rituals, and celebrations, as well as oral traditions and community history. While the\nsacred areas are not often well defined geographically, participatory mapping sessions in the\ncommunities have allowed the project proponent to form a general idea of their locations in respect to\neach village.\nThe project zone meets the criteria for HCV 6 because such sacred sites (whether nationally recognized\nor not) cannot be replaced or reestablished elsewhere. Likewise, certain plant or animal resources which\npossess cultural or religious value may only exist and reproduce within the specified project zone. The\nforest and its attributes which exist in the project area are significant HCVs because in their absence, the\nculture of the forest communities would rapidly erode.\n1.4 Project Proponent (G4)\nJadora, LLC (Jadora) is a sustainable land and resource management company based in Kirkland,\nWashington, USA.

Additionally, halophilic vegetation is present in the coastal\ndune which is dominated by creeping plants (V\u00e1zquez-Mor\u00e1n et al 2021)10.\nThe Project area is mainly located in mangrove ecosystems, a type of wetland forest.\nHas the land been cleared of native ecosystems within 10 years of the project start date?\n\u2610 Yes \u2612 No\nCurrent and historical land-use: The project is located in the Marismas Nacionales-San Blas\nmangroves which occupy an area of 2,000 square kilometres (770 sq mi) in coastal Nayarit and\nSinaloa states (note all project instances are located in Nayarit). The Marismas Nacionales is an\ninterconnected complex of lagoons and wetlands on the alluvial plain formed by the Acaponeta,\nSan Pedro Mezquital, and Grande de Santiago rivers. Beach ridges separate the wetlands from\nthe sea. The central Agua Brava Lagoon and northern Teacap\u00e1n Lagoon are the principal\nlagoons. The San Blas mangroves are the southernmost in the complex, located south of the\nGrande de Santiago River mouth.\nRed mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), black mangrove (Avicennia germinans), white mangrove\n(Laguncularia racemosa), and button mangrove (Conocarpus erectus) are found in the ecoregion.\nBlack mangrove is predominant near Teacap\u00e1n in the northern part of the ecoregion, and white\nmangrove is predominant near Agua Brava in the southern part of the ecoregion. Trees that grow\nin association with the mangroves include ciruelillo (Phyllanthus elsiae), zapot\u00f3n (Pachira\naquatica), and anona (Annona glabra).\nThe mangroves are home to over 250 species of birds and serve as an important winter habitat\nfor migratory birds. The biosphere also supports and is habitat to the jaguar (Panthera onca)\nand the river crocodile (Crocodylus acutus), one of its emblematic species; the jaguarundi, ocelot,\nas well as four species of sea turtles: white, leatherback, hawksbill, and olive ridley11.\nMangroves have been removed and degraded largely as a result of shrimp farming activities and\nconversion to pasture lands.

However,\ndue to the delay of the CDM project registration process, the project has already generated some\nemission reduction and wishes to claim the carbon credit under the Voluntary Carbon Standard\n(VCS).\nThe project is expected to reduce on average 87,586 tonnes CO2e per year. Over the 23.5 month\ncrediting period, starting from 15 February 2007 through to 30 January 2009 the total amount of\nexpected emission reduction would be 171,523 tonnes CO2e.\n1.4 A brief description of the project:\nThe Cassava Waste To Energy Project (CWTE project) is an improvement of the existing lagoons\nthat have, for many years, been used to treat wastewater generated from the cassava processing\nplant of Asia Modified Starch Co., Ltd. (AMSCO), Kalasin province. AMSCO is a group of cassava\nprocessing facilities located in the same area consisting of a native starch plant, a citric acid plant\nand a modified starch plant, with overall capacity to process up to 700 tonnes of cassava root per\nday. Approximately 5,110 m3 of wastewater is produced each day from AMSCO facilities and is\ndirected into the existing open anaerobic lagoons which have an overall capacity of 788,700 m3.\nThe project activity comprises an Anaerobic Baffled Reactor (ABR) which is a high rate anaerobic\nwastewater treatment and a biogas recovery system. Operated by Cassava Waste To Energy Co.,\nLtd. (CWTE), this new wastewater treatment facility will receive 3 wastewater streams from the\nnative starch plant, the citric acid plant and the modified starch plant, with an average COD\naround 13,385 mg\/L. ABR is designed to remove around 90% of the COD prior to release to the\nexisting lagoons.\nThe recovered methane rich biogas will be channelled back to AMSCO to generate heat for its\nproduction process. Prior to this project, AMSCO has been consuming approximately 8.8 million\nlitres of heavy fuel oil per year. The project is expected to supply all of the approximately produced\n7.1 million Nm3 of biogas per year for heat generation, which can replace approximately 4.2 million\nlitres of heavy fuel oil per year. Sometimes during operation, any excess or unusable biogas will be\nflared off.\nThe purpose of the project activity can be summarised as:\n\u2022 Treatment of organic wastewaters from cassava processing;\n\u2022 Capture of biogas for use in onsite heat and electricity generation;\n\u2022 Reduction of atmospheric emissions of the greenhouse gas (GHG); and\n\u2022 Use of the VCS process to offset some of the financial and technical risks associated with\nthe investments.\nThe project delivers reductions of anthropogenic GHG emissions in two ways:\n2","output":"{'crediting_period_start': '2007-01-15', 'crediting_period_end': '2017-01-14'}"}

Details of physical location, including information allowing the unique\nidentification of this small-scale project activity :\nThe bundled project is located on Erba Channel within the territory of Yongchang county of Jinchang city\nin Gansu province. Erba Channel lies on the southern suburb of Yongchang County and about 60km away\nfrom Jinchang City. All the six stations in the project are located along the Erba Channel from south to\nnorth in turn.\nThe geographical coordinates of powerhouse of the six stations in the bundled project are detailed in the\nfollowing table:\n\n\nCDM-SSC-PDD (version 03)\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board page 36\ncesspools will be built around the regions where the builders live. After being treated as manure and\ndisinfecting, the sewage water could be used as fertilizer.\nNoise pollution\nThe sources of noise pollution mainly come from motor vehicles and machines on the construction site.\nOnly the builders will be affected by the noise pollution because there is no residential area closed to the\nproject site. Proof measures to reduce noise pollution to the builders will be taken in the project activity.\nAir pollution\nGravel dust and waste gas emitted by motor vehicles will be the main pollutants caused air pollution. Due\nto the project is small scale and far from residential areas, the environmental impact on local atmosphere\nwill soon disappeared when the construction is completed. During the construction period, several\nmeasurements such as smoke-eliminating set will be implemented to reduce air pollution to the least to\nkeep builders\u2019 health.\nSolid waste\nTwo primary kinds of solid waste will be produced during the construction periods that are material\nresiduals and living rubbishes. A landfill site of 10\u00d7104 m3 will be built nearby for depositing the material\nresiduals and a healthy treatment plant will be designed to deal with the living rubbishes while firm proof\nfor leakage will be set.\nVegetation damage\n6597 m2 vegetation areas will be damaged due to the construction of the project. Because the proposed\nproject is a small-scale one and there is no long-term resident, the impact caused by the vegetation damage\ncould be neglected. After the project is completed, plenty of vegetations will be compensated.\nEcology damage\nThe operation of the project won\u2019t have negative impact to river ecosystem, biodiversity and problem of\nflooding or immigration. Main ecological problem raised will be soil erosion, and a series of\nenvironmental protection measures will be taken during construction and operation period. As a clean\nrenewable energy project, the project activity can also reduce the environmental pollution caused by fossil\nfuel consumption and be helpful for local economy development. Therefore, it has a favourable influence\nto the local ecological environment system.\nIn conclusion, there will have little negative effect on local environment due to the construction and\noperation of the project. After the project is put into operation, it would have contribution to\nenvironmental sustainability and economy development.\nD.2. If environmental impacts are considered significant by the project participants or the host\nParty, please provide conclusions and all references to support documentation of an environmental\nimpact assessment undertaken in accordance with the procedures as required by the host Party:\nThe environmental impacts arising from the bundled project are considered insignificant as explained\nabove and there is no transboundary impact due to the construction of the project.\nSECTION E.
