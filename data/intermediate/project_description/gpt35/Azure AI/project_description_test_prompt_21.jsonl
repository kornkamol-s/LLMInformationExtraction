Linxiang\nlocated in the northeast of Hunan Province, is known as the \"Gateway to Northern Hunan\", is\none of the major rice producing districts in China, has a population about 541,864, and annual\nhousehold income of farmers is only CNY 35,5111. The project is located in Central of Linxiang\nDistrict, Yueyang City, Hunan Province, China, with a total acreage of 8,366.48 ha for double-\ncropping rice. The project activity is designed to construction the cement ditch and reservoir to\nrealize the reducing of methane emissions by conducting intermittently flooded method instead\nof continuously flooded method during the cropping season in Central of Linxiang City.\nIn the baseline scenario, farmers in Linxiang District use continuously flooded method in rice\npaddies with the straw on field as the organic amendment inputs, which means fields have\nstanding water throughout the rice growing season and only dry out for harvest. However, the\norganic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH ) 4\nbecause of anaerobic decomposition. In the project scenario, farmers in Linxiang District\nchanging from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation. By\ncontrolled the irrigation and drainage according to the needs of rice growth, can save water\nresources. On the other hand, multiple aeration during rice cultivation can effectively reduce\nmethane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions.\nEmission reductions of this project are generated by reducing methane emissions of\ncontinuously flooded during rice cultivation in baseline scenario. With the project activity, an\nestimated amount of GHG emission reduction 7.16 tCO e\/ha for rice is expected.

Diluo Hydroelectric Project\nVersion 5.1\n19\/05\/2011\nA.2. Description of the project activity:\n>>\nThe Sichuan Huadian Xixi River Hydro-electricity Development Co., Ltd. Diluo Hydroelectric Project\n(hereafter referred to as the \u201cProject\u201d) developed by Sichuan Huadian Xixi River Hydro-electricity\nDevelopment Co., Ltd (hereafter referred to as the \u201cProject Developer\u201d), is a grid-connected hydropower\nplant with a run-of-river reservoir in Sichuan Province in People\u2019s Republic of China (hereafter referred\nto as the \u201cHost Country\u201d).\nThe purpose of the Project is to utilise the hydrological resources of the Xixi River to generate renewable\nelectricity for the Central China Power Grid (CCPG). Total installed capacity of the Project is 100 MW,\nconsisting of two 50 MW turbines. The annual electricity can be generated by the project in theory is\n445,570MWh and it is expected to supply 397,013MWh1 to the grid. The surface area of the full reservoir\nis 292000m2, and the power density of the Project is 342 W\/m2.\nElectricity delivered by the project activity to the CCPG would have otherwise been generated in grid-\nconnected fossil fuel based power plants resulting in Green House Gas (GHG) emissions in the absence of\nthe project activity. The project activity therefore, by displacing relatively carbon intensive grid\nelectricity (primary emission source with a Combined Margin Emission Factor of 0.85285 tCO \/ MWh2) 2\nwith renewable hydroelectricity, reduces GHG emission that would have occurred in the baseline.\nThe scenario existing prior to the start of the implementation of the project activity is same as the baseline\nscenario as described above.\nThe Project will contribute towards sustainable development of the Host Country. Specifically, the\nProject:\n\u2022 Increases employment opportunities in the area where it is located, and Project construction secures\njobs in the construction sector. The Project therefore contributes to poverty alleviation\n\u2022 Enhances the local investment environment, and therefore improves the local economy\n\u2022 Diversifies the sources of electricity generation. This is important for meeting growing energy\ndemands, and transitioning away from diesel and coal-supplied electricity generation\n\u2022 Makes use of renewable hydroelectric resources\n1 Expected annual electricity supply to the Grid = Annual theoretical electricity generation * Effective Power\nCoefficient * (1 \u2013 internal electricity consumption rate)* (1 \u2013 Transmission loss rate) = 445,570MWh * 0.9 *(1 \u2013\n0.5%) \u2013 (1 \u2013 0.5%) = 397,013MWh.\n2 Please refer annex 3 for details","output":"{'project_name': 'Sichuan Huadian Xixi River Hydro-electricity Development Co., Ltd.

Project Details:\n1.1. Summary Description of Project:\nThe Afognak Forest Carbon Project covers 3,326.5 ha (8,219.7 acres) of adjacent or proximal parcels\nlocated on the North coast (Perenosa Bay\/Delphin Bay area) of Afognak Island, Alaska.\nIn a series of transactions outlined in Section 7, the American Land Conservancy (ALC) and the Rocky\nMountain Elk Foundation (RMEF) acquired the Afognak Carbon project properties and related timber\nrights from the privately owned Alaskan Native Corporations (Afognak Joint Venture, Shuyak, Inc., and\nUganik Natives, Inc.) over the period of 2005-2009, with the objective of conserving the land in\nperpetuity. As part of these transactions, ALC\/RMEF specifically retained the carbon legal title rights\nand right of use for the purpose of a carbon emissions reduction project; attached a permanent federal\nconservation easement to ensure perpetual conservation management; and transferred the remaining\nsurface title rights to the State of Alaska.\nThe Afognak Forest Carbon Project achieves net GHG emission reductions and removals through the\navoidance of emissions due to logging in the baseline scenario. The Afognak properties were being\nmanaged for timber production by the previous managers, with existing or pending logging plans in\nplace across these and adjacent properties owned by the previous owners. The most plausible\nbaseline scenario is a clear-cut, timber-harvesting scenario following minimum State of Alaska forest\npractice requirements and common practices clearly evident in previous logging on the project lands\nand adjacent lands across Afognak Island.\nThe project scenario is conservation management, wherein the State of Alaska manages and monitors\nthe properties for the purpose of wilderness and ecosystem protection and enhancement activities\nunder the terms of the title transfer agreement and federal conservation easement. The project\nscenario retains the current native and naturally regenerating logged forests in perpetuity to retain and\nsequester carbon on the property.\n1.2. Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nSector 14 - AFOLU\nImproved Forest Management (IFM)\nLogged Forest to Protected Forest (LtPF)\nThe Afognak Forest Carbon Project is consistent with the VCS eligibility for an IFM-LtFP project by\n\u201cprotecting unlogged forests that would be logged in the absence of carbon finance\u201d.\n1.3.

Such proof is not required where such clearing or\nconversion took place at least 10 years prior to the proposed project start date. The onus\nis upon the project proponent to demonstrate this, failing which the project shall not be\neligible.\nThe project will only work on lands that have been cleared of their native ecosystems for over 10 years\nbefore the project start. This is an eligibility criterion for participation of new instances in the Grouped\nProject, and must be demonstrated for their inclusion in the Grouped Project. For all lands included in the\nfirst instances in Loreto and Ucayali this has been demonstrated through the use of social surveys and\nusing satellite imagery. All areas planted in the first instance have been cleared of the native ecosystem\nsince at least 2002.\nVCS Criterion 4.2.1: Eligible ARR activities are those that increase carbon sequestration\nand\/or reduce GHG emissions by establishing, increasing or restoring vegetative cover\n(forest or non forest) through the planting, sowing or human-assisted natural regeneration\nof woody vegetation. Eligible ARR projects may include timber harvesting in their\nmanagement plan. The project area shall not be cleared of native ecosystems within the 10\nyear period prior to the project start date, as set out in Section 3.1.6. ( above)\nThe project activities increase carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems and reduce GHG emissions\nin the atmosphere through the planting of native fruit and timber trees.

The rice bran is\nprocured from rice mills locally.\nRice bran quality deteriorates rapidly if not processed into oil and\/or stabilized with steam in\npelletized form. In order to stabilize the rice bran, the project host transforms the rice bran into\npellets in the pelletization plant. The pellets will then be processed in the extraction plant to\nproduce the rice bran oil. The steam used in the pelletization and extraction plant will be\ngenerated using steam boilers.\nThis VCS project activity involves installation of rice husk based boiler to generate the steam\nrequired in the rice bran collection centre which is located at Thot Not. The Thot Not collection\ncentre is already in operation since May 2009 with a rice bran pelletization capacity of\n700tonnes\/day. The project host will expand the plant, where the capacity of rice bran\npelletization plant will be increased to 1,200tonnes\/day and there will be a new rice bran oil\nextraction plant with a capacity of 800tonnes\/day by July 2012. A new 17 MT\/hour of rice husk\nbased boiler will be installed at the plant in addition to the existing 10 MT\/hour rice husk based\nboiler.\nIn the project activity, saturated steam of 15 kg\/cm2is required for the operations. For the purpose\nof this VCS project activity, rice husk will be procured from rice mills located nearby the site (i.e.\nwithin 50km radius).\nIn the absence of this project activity, fossil fuel (i.e. medium fuel oil or \u201cMFO\u201d) would have been\nused to fire the boilers, resulting in CO emissions. In addition, rice husk which is waste from rice 2\nmill operations in the region would have been dumped in unplanned ways including into nearby\nriver, resulting in natural decay and CH emissions. This project activity thus, reduce greenhouse 4\ngas (GHG) emissions by avoiding carbon dioxide (CO ) and methane (CH ) emissions from 2 4\ncombustion of MFO and decomposition of rice husk in disposal sites, respectively. In addition, the\nproject activity prevents local environmental problems such as river congestion and ecological\ndamage.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nAccording to the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) criteria, which is an approved GHG\nprogram as per the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS), the project is in Sectoral Scope 1 \u2013 \u2018Energy\nIndustries (renewable sources)\u2019 and Sector 13 \u2013 \u2018Waste handling and disposal\u2019.\nHence as per the CDM guidelines, as per Appendix B of \u2018Simplified modalities for small-scale\nCDM project activities), the project activity falls into the following types:\n1.

It is\nin the metropolitan region of Manaus, about 270 km from the capital through the AM-010 highway, which\nis an important axis of regional development because it facilitates the flow of people, goods, and services\nthroughout the central-eastern portion of the state. It has the third largest GDP of the state of Amazonas,\nbehind only the municipality of Coari and the capital Manaus itself (IBGE, 2022). In 2022, the municipal\nGDP reached the amount of R$2 billion, 43% of these resources were concentrated in the agriculture\nand cattle raising sector, 37% in the services sector, and 20% in industry. According to Alho (2009), a\nresearcher in Regional Development at the Federal University of Amazonas, Itacoatiara is a municipality\nwith a great potential for growth, a scenario that becomes even more favorable due to its geographical\nlocation, on the banks of the Urubu River, a branch of the Amazon River, which houses a port and makes\nits economic dynamics even more powerful.\nThis opportunity for local development comes from: \"the availability of natural resources (rivers, roads,\nforests, and land) that can be incorporated into the political-economic development, by big capital, or as\na goal of government action\" (Alho, 2009). Also, according to the author, in the international division of\nlabor, the municipality presents itself as a center of agricultural production, although most of its\nworkforce is allocated mainly in trade (55%) and industry (41%) (Alho, 2009). The primary sector is home\nto only 5% of the formal workers in the municipality, with soybeans and sugar cane being the main\nproducts grown on plantations and properties emerging along the AM-010 highway, which provides\naccess between the two cities. The extraction of wood, rubber, and non-elastic gums is very\n37\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nrepresentative of the local economy. Cattle raising is represented mainly by cattle and pigs, with meat\nand milk production destined for local consumption and export. Fishing is abundant, and the municipality\nstands out as a fishing entrepot, both for local consumption and for export.\nRegarding the situation of the roads, it is worth mentioning that the AM-010 highway was completely\nasphalted in November 2022, within the period of the state elections, according to local residents. The\nimprovement in the asphalt reduced by half the time required to travel between Manaus and Itacoatiara\nwhich takes an average of 2.5 hours by car. This reduction in travel time was confirmed by Systemica's\nresearch team, who witnessed part of the work in progress, during fieldwork carried out to produce this\ndocument. This facilitation of traffic on the highway has enormous potential in reducing the costs of\nproduction flow, increasing the flow of goods and services in the regional context, implying an opportunity\nto expand the generation of employment and income, with the potential to enable more efficient transport\nof the production coming from family farming, of great importance in reducing social and economic\ninequalities that affect the most vulnerable rural communities in the Amazon context.\nThe state production of pineapple, citrus, banana, cupua\u00e7u, and more recently coffee is mostly promoted\nby small producers, with some initiatives that already focus on sustainable local development,\nassociating economic growth, improvement of the quality of life of populations and communities, and\nforest preservation. Organic products, low carbon economy, and agroforestry systems have great\npotential for strengthening, given the increased environmental awareness of some of these producers\nwho are moving to abandon culturally ingrained techniques, such as the use of fire to clear cultivable\nareas, and the use of chemicals and pesticides for soil correction and to combat pests. There is a\nmovement towards the use of organic inputs, based on a culture of reuse, such as composting, avoiding\nthe use of substances that negatively impact the quality of food, and that have great potential for\ncontamination of the soil, rivers, and fish since fish production is crucial for the subsistence of a\nsignificant part of the riverside and fishing communities that inhabit the entire Amazon basin, as rich in\nwater resources as in biodiversity. This ability of the municipality of Itacoatiara to attract many strategic\nprojects that bring the premises of sustainable development is due to the \"existence of infrastructure\n(port, airport, roads), the proximity to major international consumers and the prospect of new public and\nprivate investments\" (Alho, 2009) that reinforce its position of relevance in relation to other municipalities\nin the Middle Amazon, having in the future the prospect of becoming a regional pole in the scope of\nenvironmentally and socially responsible projects, capable of attracting investments, reducing\ninequalities, improving the living conditions of local populations, such as basic sanitation, and the\nabsence of public services, high rates of hospitalization for diarrhea and infant mortality.\nAlthough Itacoatiara presents a good economic performance, in 2020, the average monthly salary was\n1.8 minimum wage, occupying position 25 among the 62 Amazonian municipalities, which can be\nconsidered small in comparison with the size of the municipal GDP, the third in the state. Considering the\ndomiciles with monthly incomes of up to half a minimum wage per person, Itacoatiara presented 45.2%\nof its population in these conditions, which places it in position 57 out of 62 among the cities in the state.\nIt has only 19.7% of households with adequate sanitary sewage and only 11.9% with adequate\nurbanization, which includes the presence of culverts, sidewalks, paving, and curbs (IBGE, 2022).\nAccording to the Environmental Impact Assessment - EIA - related to the implementation of the Itacoatiara\n38","output":"{'project_name': 'Amazon Biome Conservancy Grouped REDD+ Project', 'project_summary': 'The Amazon Biome Conservancy Grouped REDD+ Project (hereinafter also referred to as \u201cABC\u201d) has as its main objective to contribute to the preservation with the biggest tropical forest of the world in the Brazilian territory, while providing significant improvements in the social interface. The project for this validation process has only one project activity instance located in the Itacoatiara municipality, state of Amazonas near its capital of Manaus. According to the geo-referencing data, the total area of the project is established at 5,140 ha, which is composed of native Amazon Rainforest vegetation, without the existence of secondary vegetation since the land has not been cleared of native ecosystems within the last 10 years before the project start date.

The\nobjective of the workshops was to mobilize and train farmers in the correct method of planting\nsaplings, management of water and weeding. All the members of the village community were\ninvited to join in the local stakeholder\u2019s consultation meetings organized by the PP where they\nwereinformed about the benefits of improving the treecover in their land holdings. The individual\nfarmers were asked to formalise the relationship with PP by entering into a carbon offset\nagreement. They were told that the project activity would result in generation of carbon credits\nand that they would earn carbon revenue from the sale of carbon credits. Thus, carbon revenue\nwould be additional to their regular income from farm produce.

Such\ncertificates were issued for some communal lands during the nationwide land registration and\ncertification. Where they do not exist, a communal landholding certificate can be obtained. This involves\nan elaborate process, whereby the project developer must work with the local entities such as Kebele\nleaders, community members, village-level Land Use and Administration Committee, and extension\nworkers (also called \u2018development agents\u2019), and the district (woreda) land administration experts to\ndemarcate\/map the land, designate it as \u2018communal holding\u2019, and eventually get a landholding certificate\nissued for the designated land. It is a consultative community process that can take weeks or months to\ncomplete. Therefore, pursuing this rather long process makes sense where large communal land parcels\nare available for implementing the project \u2013 for example \u2013 in forest landscape restoration projects.\nTransfer of Carbon Rights\nEvery farmer participating in the program signs a planting contract with the cooperative setting the\nconditions of their participation in the program, in which they agree to transfer their rights over\necosystem services (including carbon) to the cooperative. The contract specifies that the cooperative,\nin collaboration with PUR, will provide seedlings, trainings, technical assistance and maintenance\npremium to the farmer, while the farmer commits to plant, tend to the trees, and respect the\nsustainable timber management plan.\n1.9 Project Start Date\n1.10 Project Crediting Period\n1.11 Project Scale and Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals\n13","output":"{'crediting_period_start': '2021-04-04', 'crediting_period_end': '2051-04-03'}"}

There are no emissions trading\nprograms in place in the country.\nOther Forms of Environmental Credit\n1.16.1\nThe grouped project is not being used to create other environmental credits.\n1.17 Additional Information Relevant to the Project\nLeakage Management\n1.16.2\nThe Forestal Apepu Carbon Project aims to increase the carbon stock of former agricultural land\nand implanted pastures through afforestation. Leakage would only occur if pre-project activities\nby previous owners would be shifted somewhere else in detriment of natural forests and\/or\necosystems. The risk of leakage is low. As a known fact, to date, previous owners have not shifted\npre-project activities to any other region were deforestation\/forest conversion is allowed.\nCommercially Sensitive Information\nNone.\nSustainable Development\nThe project contributes to the national forest sector by providing proof of concept and\nimplementation of models aligned to political goals, such as the national plan of reforestation\n(Decree N\u00ba 10,147 of 2012), governmental efforts to formalize the biomass sector (Decree N\u00ba\n4056\/2015), and the contribution to the National Determined Contributions of the country,\nwhere afforestation is highlighted as a prominent measure.\nOn the other hand, the Apepu Carbon Project will be one of the first to introduce the carbon\ncomponent, which will bring about proof of concept and more experience in the region. The\nproject managers will inform the national authorities of the Project, to avoid any possible double\naccounting in the future, and contribute to any governmental efforts in this regard.\nFurther Information\nAdditional information is provided in the Appendix and in the relevant sections.\n32","output":"{'crediting_period_start': '2019-06-28', 'crediting_period_end': '2039-06-27'}"}
