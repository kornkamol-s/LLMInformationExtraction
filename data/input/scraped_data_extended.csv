"Restoration of degraded areas and reforestation in Cáceres and Cravo Norte, Colombia","The project envisions the reforestation of grasslands in Colombia.

The A/R project activity proposes to reforest ~ 1,230 ha in the area of Cáceres/Antioquia and ~ 9,640 ha in Cravo Norte/Arauca. The project areas were previously exposed to extensive cattle grazing activities. In addition to cattle grazing, some parts of the Cáceres area was exposed to alluvial gold mining. The project seeks to promote sustainable management of forest resources in a manner that fosters natural regeneration. Since 2002, Asorpar Ltd. has been reforesting land with about 25 native tree species planted in different stand models that allow for natural regeneration of flown in seeds on the reforestation sites. Asorpar Ltd. puts emphasis on promoting mixed stands. This sets their approach apart from other commercial plantation forestry entities active in Colombia. The management of mixed stands is far more challenging than of monocultures. This circumstance is reinforced by the fact that little is known about several tree species planted in the project, particularly with regard to their growth performance and silvicultural management. Hence, the proposed project activity offers a unique opportunity to obtain valuable knowledge about silvicultural management practices for mixed plantation forestry and suitability of native tree species for commercial plantation forestry.",Antioquia and Arauca,"Asorpar Ltd.

The Darkwoods property was being sold by the previous owner on a bid basis based on a sales price from a formal property and timber valuation/appraisal similar to the baseline scenario.  The most plausible baseline scenario is a market-driven acquirer who implements a 15-year depletion of current mature timber stocks to provide a reasonable internal rate of return on investment.  Under the baseline scenario, a 100-year uneven harvest scheduleis implemented with the typical regional practice of clearcut logging with minimum legal requirements for private forestlands in B.C. and comparable regional practices.The project scenario is conservation management activities, wherein NCC undertakes the carbon project and ecosystem protection and enhancement activities.

CAYKARA HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANT,"Caykara hydroelectric power plant project is located at the northeast of Turkey, in the Black Sea Region, on the Solakli Creek, in the province of Trabzon, within the district of Dernekpazari, at the border to the district of Caykara.  The feasibility of the project was developed by Black Sea Technical University as a single project, to generate energy by utilizing the water potential of Solakli Creek in the Trabzon province of Black Sea region. The previous study for the region was made by the Sate Hydro Works in 1981. However it was seen during the mapping studies that, the height above sea level which was assumed based on the existing maps of the region as being 275 meters for the weir and 155 meters for the tailgate water, is actually 259 meter for the weir and 149 meter for the tailgate water. Since this would cause a loss of energy and installed capacity, a revised feasibility was submitted which was accepted on 6.11.2007 by the State Hydro Works, whereby the weir riverbed elevation a.s.l. was increased to 278 meters.  REDAS Elektrik Uretim Dagitim Pazarlama Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. has been awarded the project based on a price of 0.07 TL (divided by one million) to be submitted to State Hydro Works for each kWh produced, the license being granted for a period of 49 years by the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA) on 31.12.2007. The project consists of a 40 meters long concrete weir at 5 meters riverbed elevation, 7175 m long rectangular shaped transmission tunnel, forebay, desilting pool, spillway, 200 m long penstock and a powerhouse with 2 horizontal axis Pelton turbines.  Caykara HEPP project has an installed capacity of 26.04 MWw and expected to generate annually about 108.29 GWh of electricity on the average. Electricity generated by the power plant will be delivered to the grid by 14 km long 34.5 kV transmission line, connected to medium voltage of Caykara TM substation.",Trabzon Province,"REDAS Elektrik Uretim Dagitim Pazarlama Sanayi

"REDD project in Brazil nut concessions in Madre de Dios, Peru","BAM has entered into a long term partnership with the Madre de Dios Federation of Brazil nut Concessioners (FEPROCAMD) aimed at preventing deforestation and preserving environmental integrity on 300,000 hectares of concession land in high quality rainforest. The project is helping to establish initiatives which will increase both the value of the healthy forest and the income generated through sustainable Brazil nut harvesting, empowering concessioners to protect and maintain their forest. Currently, concessioners’ activity is limited to subsistence Brazil nut collection and, in a very few cases, subsistence forestry. The long-term wellbeing of concessioners and their families is highly dependent on the health of local ecosystems, but they have few resources with which to protect their concessions. Illegal deforestation on concession land has increased due to the new InterOceanic Highway, which passes through Madre de Dios. The construction of this road has brought unusually high numbers of migrants to the area, many of whom use concession land to fulfill their housing and work needs. There have been significant increases in unsustainable, illegal, small-scale agriculture and logging.",Department of Madre de Dios,"Bosques Amazónicos

The threats to the area have increased in the last decade with the development of regional infrastructure projects and the rising price of coffee -the main crop grown in this area- leading to increasing deforestation and the subsequent loss of ecosystem services that this NPA provides. This scenario will continue unless new mechanisms are designed to add value to the standing forest so that it can compete economically with other land uses. In response, Conservation International and its allies in the region designed the Alto Mayo Conservation Initiative (AMCI), whose main goal is to promote the sustainable management of the AMPF and its ecosystem services for the benefit of the local populations and the global climate.

Cordillera Azul National Park REDD Project,"The Cordillera Azul National Park REDD+ Project avoids deforestation in a magnificent expanse of lowland and montane forests in four departments in central Peru: San Martín, Ucayali, Huánuco, and Loreto. The area encompasses 1,351,964 hectares inside the national park. The park, owned by the government of Peru, is managed and financed by the Peruvian NGO Centro de Conservación, Investigación y Manejo de Áreas Naturales (CIMA) through a public-private partnership piloted by the Peruvian government. The project’s avoided-deforestation objective is accomplished by strengthening park protection, engaging local communities and other stakeholders in land-use management compatible with conservation, and improving the quality of life of the park’s neighbors.  Approximately 180,000 people in more than 200 communities – immigrant and indigenous – neighbor the park. Villagers close to the park mostly practice subsistence agriculture; those closer to major roads engage in market activities as well. CIMA and its close advisor, The Field Museum in Chicago, have worked with communities since 2002 to ensure that the project activities incorporate and reflect the values and aspirations of local residents. The project activities are highly participatory, with villagers leading several efforts and developing competencies that will enable long-term success.The biodiversity in the project area is astounding. Intact forests stretch from lowlands (150 meters) to ragged mountain peaks (2,400 meters). This eastern outlier of the Andes has been isolated sufficiently long for speciation to occur: more than 35 species new to science have been discovered in the park to date. The forests harbor rare and endangered species, as well as abundant populations of animals and plants that are crucial to the well-being of park neighbors.",,"CIMA, Cordillera Azul

By purchasing the Reserve in 2003, the Conservancy was able to stop an immediate threat of deforestation associated with the construction of a coastal highway through the property, and to stop the ongoing conversion of native forest to exotic plantations, by cancelling the legal and transferrable forest management permits which had allowed forest conversion. With these actions taken to stop deforestation and degradation of native forests, more than 350,000 tons of CO2 emissions are estimated to have been prevented from being released into the atmosphere—the equivalent of taking more than 67,000 passenger vehicles off U.S. roads for one full year.

"Evio Kuiñaji Ese´Eja Cuana, To Mitigate Climate Change, Madre de Dios - Perú","Achieved validation to the CCB Standards Second Edition, Climate and Biodiversity Gold Levels, on 09 March 2015.Madre de Dios is the Amazon region with the highest levels of biodiversity in the country, that’s why it earned the title of Biodiversity Capital of Peru  in 1994. In this region we find the natural habitat of endangered animal species such as the black caiman (Melanosuchus Niger), the harpy eagle (Harpy Eagle) and the giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) as well as habitat for forest species of economic importance as chestnut (bertholletia excelsa). Currently, Madre de Dios faces an abrupt change in land use and accelerated forest degradation; historically, this same region was characterized by low levels of deforestation, so that the impact generated, affects the well-preserved status of this area. This change may be a result of the construction of the South Inter-Oceanic Highway, which generated greater accessibility and therefore increased immigration. In this scenario, we need to add up the advancement of informal gold mining, fueled by the rising price of gold, whose mode of extraction is highly polluting and causing deforestation in areas adjacent to the rivers of the region.The project will be developed in the Native Community of Ese'Eja Infierno and its Ecotourism Concession located in Madre de Dios, these areas belong politically to the province of Tambopata, Tambopata District, adding a total area of 7749.94 hectares. The purpose of the project is to conserve community forests and their concession, against de rapidly increase of deforestation. The project proposes to reduce the pressure to change the use of land in the project area through the promotion of sustainable economic activities, forest governance and the establishment of conservation agreements on critical areas previously identified. These actions are intended to avoid the expansion of agriculture; to achieve them, permanent coordination and alliances will be made with institutions that currently are conducting conservation activities in the area.Also, the control and monitoring system of the community and its concession will be strengthened, emphasizing on the formation and operation of forest guards, which have an official recognition of the Regional Directorate of Forestry and Wildlife of Madre de Dios, which represents a strategy of community involvement.With these actions, the project hopes to avoid annual average net emissions of 117,676.00 tCO2-e. in the referenced scenario during the first 10 years period, in which, because of migration and occupation of the land that promotes the operation of the South Interoceanic Highway, an average of 289.76 ha per year will be deforested.The project includes benefits for the concerned people and the conservation of biodiversity, beyond the benefits of reducing GHG emissions.

All groups will be planted on the 6,024 ha. Coffee will be introduced after 3 years on 3,000 ha. The different species groups of the proposed ARR project activity comprise, among others, Mango, Guava, Custard apple, Orange, Lemon, and other local fruit trees. In addition Teak, Bamboo and various indigenous trees will be introduced. After a tree establishment phase, coffee will be planted under shade.  The planting area is located on degraded land with very low plant cover (around 60% of the land is classified as barren land.). The horticultural tree planting will sequester carbon and generate additional income by turning this degraded, low carbon lands into high carbon sites. The overall goal of the project is to improve the livelihood of small and marginalized tribal communities in the Araku Valley of Visakhapatnam district in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India. The project will turn a low carbon landscape into a high carbon multiple use landscape improving food security and generating additional income for the community. The project area will cover 333 villages in 5 different Mandals and as an average approximately 16 planting sites per village. Totally, on 5,442 discrete areas of non-forested land with a geographical identification the horticulture systems will be established. The tribal communities living in the project area are Bhagathas, Valmikies, Kamaras, Porjas and Kondhs. They converse in a dialect of Adivasi Oriya and Kui. The area is very secluded and still many of the villages are inaccessible by vehicles. 90% of the population in the project area is living below the poverty line.  The livelihoods of the tribal communities in the region have a distinct set of economic characteristics which differ widely from the lowlands adjoining this area of Visakhapatnam, with respect to climate, soil, rainfall, habitat, flora, and fauna. Subsistence agriculture is the primary livelihood for nearly 99% of the tribes and special characteristics are: • Agriculture through Slash and Burn Technique on hill slopes, known as Podu cultivation; • Gathering of Non Timber Forest Products; • Farming on terraces or in valleys both under irrigated and rain fed condition, and • Cattle and backyards gardens. The current annual average income of households in the region ranges between INR.15, 000 to INR 18, 000 (USD 350-400). Indiscriminate Podu cultivation has resulted in barren lands with increased soil erosion leading to environmental degradation has contributed to poverty and deprivation in the area. Dependence on forest and land has become extremely difficult for the tribal way of live. The rate of growth in population and diminishing forest cover makes them extremely vulnerable.  Therefore, an integrated, holistic development approach revolving around building their local resources and skills to improve the agriculture and Non Timber Forest Produce (NTFP) needs to be adopted to address the issue of tribal poverty and build their economies.",Andhra Pradesh,"Livelihoods Fund SICAV SIF

Planting for the Future: Financially sustainable agroforestry systems and payments for ecosystem services,"Our project creates a scalable model for sustainable agriculture, which will reduce deforestation and which will be adopted at a landscape scale in the Peruvian Amazon. Farmers’ technical and business capacity will be enhanced, they will gain access to formal markets for native fruit and timber, and their incomes will be increased and diversified. As a result, the livelihoods of farming families will be enhanced and poverty reduced.  The project design is applicable to landowning smallholder farmers across Peru who have in the past relied on ‘slash and burn’ shifting cultivation agriculture or ranching that resulted in unproductive agricultural lands and degraded pastures.  The project will provide seedlings and training to farmers to reforest their farms, converting them from low productivity migratory agriculture where they have to rotate farmed areas to  market-orientated agroforestry systems.  The first project instances are located in Loreto and Ucayali Provinces of Peru.",Peruvian Amazon,"Plant your Future

Initially in tandem with Jadora, Inc., a firm based in Seattle, WA, but now solely managed by SAFBOIS as the project proponent, the Isangi REDD+ Project was formerly a SAFBOIS-owned logging concession, which has now been developed into a REDD+ project to preserve this critical ecosystem . Current project activities and the secession of logging has demonstrated that the Isangi project will remove over ten million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the earth's atmosphere through improved management -- enough to offset three months of carbon emissions for the city of New York or 100,000 average US households for a year.The Isangi project provides many benefits to indigenous people. The project area is home to 30 villages with a combined population of more than 50,000 people. The Isangi project protects high conservation value forests, providing ancillary benefits to the wildlife and the people and is one of the most diverse habitats on the planet. It supports threatened and endangered species such as leopards, forest elephants, Red River hogs, 14 species of primates, (most notably the Bonobo chimpanzee), dwarf crocodiles, hornbills and rare bats. The area hosts 11% of the world's known bird species and is a haven of biodiversity.Key Facts:• A former logging concession converted to a REDD+ (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) conservation project• Project area: 184,000 hectares of primary forest• Verified and Validated in September 2014, achieving the highest industry standard, a Gold rating by the VCS and CCBA; seek",Orientale Province,"SAFBOIS, SPRL

Grouped Project for Commercial Forest Plantations Initiatives in the Department of Vichada,"The Grouped Project for Commercial Forest Plantations Initiatives in the Department of Vichada aims to promote investments new commercial forest plantations in Puerto Carreño Municipality. The project is based on changing the use of land from extensive cattle ranching to sustainable forest production systems, restoring natural forest cover, and creating a landscape of biological and productive corridors that produce financial, social and environmental services for the region. These impacts include the mitigation of climate change, regulation of water flows, expansion of habitat and conservation of the flora and fauna in the zone and the Orinoco region.The Project area for the first instance corresponds to the properties of La Pedregoza, El Toro, Canapro, El Diamante and Horizonte Verde, located at the veredas Caño Negro, Aceito, La Esmeralda and Campo Alegre, in the municipality of Puerto Carreño (Department of Vichada, Colombia). The land within the project boundary is degraded grassland for all cases of the grouped instances, as they all occur in the same baseline conditions. Such grasslands grasslands have been historically subject to burns that took place with the objective to reduce tree covers and expand grasslands in order to develop extensive cattle ranching activities. However, all properties conserve remnants of gallery forests and natural areas.

COMACO Landscape Management Project,"The COMACO Landscape Management Project (CLMP) promotes sustainable agriculture and forest conservation. The main objectives of the project are twofold: 1) to sustainably increase smallholder farmer agricultural productivity, income, and welfare; and 2) to reduce uncontrolled forest loss and degradation and increase net forest cover. Hence, the project comprises two components:
1. Sustainable Agricultural Land Management (SALM) component – which aims to promote widespread adoption of agricultural practices including conservation agriculture that increase food production per unit area and farmers’ income. The project promotes the adoption by farmers of legume-based alley cropping, residues management (e.g., mulching; cessation of residue burning), and reduced tillage among other SALM practices.
2. REDD+ (Avoided Unplanned Deforestation) component – which aims to reduce forest loss, and protect and expand areas under natural forest, and conserve biodiversity. This is achieved primarily through land use planning and creation of Community Conservation Areas (CCA), coupled with sustainable non-extractive forest use, e.g., honey and mushrooms. 
The project stretches across twenty-eight chiefdoms in eight districts in the Eastern Province of Zambia, namely: Chikomeni, Chikuwe, Jumbe, Luembe, Magodi, Mwasemphangwe, Mwape, Nyamphande, Zumwanda, Nyalugwe, Chinunda, Ndake, Mumbi, Mwanjawuntu, Kalindawalo, Nyanje, Katumba, Sandwe, Msoro, Mbangombe, Kawaza, Nzamane, Mpezeni, Mnukwa, Mafuta, Chanje, Kazembe and Madzimawe. It is a grouped project as defined in the VCS Standard (version 4.0); the first project activity instance comprises 7,372 ha of agricultural land for the SALM component, and 116,629 ha for the REDD+ component. The project has added 19 Chiefdoms in its third monitoring period increasing the project areas for both components to 44,944ha for SALM and 216,157ha for REDD+ component. The potential project area for the SALM component is estimated to be about 160,000 ha of agricultural land, and for the REDD+ at 757,023 ha of forest. 
Prior to the project, poor farming practices such as residue burning led to rapid soil nutrient depletion. There was also a general lack of land use planning and forest management, undertaken in a participatory and coordinated manner – which led to destruction and fragmentation of the forests. The COMACO Landscape Management Project uses market incentives to promote adoption of SALM practices and forest and wildlife conservation. It uses land use planning with traditional leaders and communities to identify and zone areas for conservation and forest management known as Community Conservation Areas (CCA). A Community Conservation Plan (CCP) is developed and implemented for specific CCAs – including activities for sustainable forest management, and rules regarding forest management. These activities will result in increased and sustainable agricultural production, and forest conservation. GHG emission reductions will be generated through improved carbon storage on farms, and avoidance of mosaic deforestation from unplanned agricultural land conversion. Two VCS-approved carbon methodologies are used to account for the project’s emissions reductions.
The annual average GHG emission reductions of the project are estimated at 237,841tCO2-e, and total GHG emission reductions over 20 years are estimated at 4,756,828 tCO2-e. This estimate considers only the first 10 years of GHG emission reductions for the REDD+ component.",Eastern Province,Community Markets for Conservation (COMACO),,Registered,122047,,"192,968",Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use,REDD,"VM0015,VM0017",216157 Hectares,,SCS Global Services,06/04/2020,"1st, 01/07/2012 - 30/06/2032",,,,,,1532

REDD+ Project for Caribbean Guatemala: The Conservation Coast,"This project is an Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) project under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) project category. Specifically, the project is of the “Avoided Unplanned Deforestation & Degradation” (AUDD) project category.The project is estimated to generate approximately 17,921,895 VCUs over 30 years. The project area is located in Department of Izabal in the Caribbean coast region of Guatemala in the Sarstun-Motagua reference region proposed by the national level REDD+ program. Belonging to the biologically diverse Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, forests in the project area are important nationally and internationally for the ecosystem services they provide. The project area forests, however, have experienced a continued reduction in biomass due largely to small-scale farmers and medium to large scale cattle ranchers that have sought to expand their activities or have been displaced by agro-industrial expansion. These forests have also historically been an important source of income for local families, who periodically harvest small amounts of timber when the economic needs arise.In 2013 Guatemala passed the Framework for the Regulation of the Reduction of Vulnerability, the Mandatory Adaptation to the effects of Climate Change and the Mitigation of the effects of Greenhouse Gases (Decree 07-2013) which gave landowners the rights to emission reductions generated in either voluntary or compliance markets.  This law allowed the REDD+ Project for Caribbean Guatemala to pursue a Grouped Project design where the project proponent, FUNDAECO, could represent small landowners and manage the development of a REDD+ project on their behalf through legal contracts that transfer project ownership to FUNDAECO.The expansion of industrial agriculture and migration of subsistence farmers and cattle ranchers into protected areas is a historical trend observed in the project zone.  Consequently, forests and land within protected areas are an important source of income within the project zone and is the major focus of the REDD+ project.  The project aims to alleviate these pressures on the forests through the support of governance capacity (including individual property titling, land-use planning and conservation zone demarcation), the generation of alternative economic activities and income sources, and through capacity building in administration and management.  These project activities, beyond protecting local forests and biodiversity, contribute to social and economic development in one of the poorest areas of Guatemala. The effectiveness of these activities is partially dependent on their long-term economic success and wide-spread adoption. Since the project’s inception, local communities have been actively participating in the project’s formulation and implementation.  The early involvement of participating communities has created awareness among community members and readiness for project implementation.",Izabal,"Fundacion para el Ecodesarrollo y la Conservacion [FUNDAECO]

Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary,"Nestled in the lush jungles of eastern Cambodia, the Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary (KSWS) is a haven for biodiversity and a vast storehouse of forest carbon. Spanning over 290,000 hectares, the protected area is home to a diverse array of wildlife, including 84 globally threatened species and the world's largest population of black-shanked douc and yellow-cheeked crested gibbon. The KSWS also holds a unique cultural significance for the Indigenous Bunong people, who have called this forest home for centuries and whose culture and livelihoods are deeply entwined with the forest. Despite the importance of this area, it faces a high threat of deforestation due to various factors, including forest conversion for agriculture and illegal logging.


The Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary REDD+ Project (KSWS REDD+), launched in 2010 as a collaboration between the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), has made impressive strides in reducing deforestation and promoting alternative livelihoods. The project has prevented the release of more than 20 million tons of CO2e emissions and saved 25,000 hectares of forest from destruction. It has also created jobs, supported education and training initiatives, and established an ecotourism venture that supports local communities.


The project has also distributed nearly $1 million through its Cash for Communities (C4C) program, a mechanism that shares the revenue of carbon credits sales. These funds go directly to local communities, who decide how they should be spent to support sustainable development activities such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure like wells and bridges.

In Cambodia, the Ministry of Environment is at the forefront of protecting the country's protected areas, with a focus on preserving the nation's forests.

Regenerating Colombian Coffee Ecosystems,"Regenerating Colombian Coffee Ecosystems is a grouped afforestation and reforestation project initiated by PUR Projet in 2014 in the Colombian Northern Andean Montane Forests, where watersheds and coffee lands are severely eroded and biologically degraded.Colombia is the world’s third largest coffee producer and 95% of Colombian coffee-growing families operate on small plots of land, averaging five acres each. The Tropical Andes are one of the main coffee growing areas in Columbia and a major biodiversity hotspot, hosting 25% of the country's flora and being the richest ecoregion for birds in the country (974 bird species). However, Colombia’s Andean watersheds are threatened by uncontrolled deforestation due to rapid expansion of agriculture and cattle grazing, which strongly degrades the coffee farming conditions and the yields: low pollination, high erosion, frequent pests and diseases, low water resources. The lack of natural protection makes the farms highly vulnerable to extreme climatic events such as prolonged droughts, heavy rains, storms, landslides, etc. Besides, coffee farmers often depend on a single source of income and are highly vulnerable to market fluctuations: price volatility, demand variation, increased costs for inputs such as fertilizers, etc. Farms are not economically resilient and they are not resilient to climate change either. In this context, PUR Projet initiated an afforestation and reforestation project in Colombia in 2014, in collaboration with small-scale coffee farmers. PUR Projet is an international organization specialized in the development of ecosystems restoration and conservation projects, within agricultural supply chains like coffee and cocoa. PUR Projet also assists companies in insetting their supply chains and managing their socio-environmental commitments.",La Sierra; Rosas; La Vega El Peñol; El Tambo,"The PURE PROJECT SAS

Interwaste Landfill gas Grouped Project,"This project description contains information about both the proposed Grouped Project “Interwaste landfill gas Grouped Project” as well as the first project activity instance at FG Landfill.The party responsible (the Project Proponent) for the Grouped Project and the first project activity instance is Interwaste Holdings Limited. Interwaste has developed a municipal waste landfill gas recovery project and is looking towards producing compressed biogas fuel that can be supplied in to external customers with the distribution in trucks. The project instance is located at the Interwaste FG landfill site. This site is located next to Olifantsfontein road, Tembisa, in Midrand, in the province of Gauteng, Republic of South Africa (RSA).The Grouped Project proposed in this project description allows for the following project activity types:• The installation of a new LFG capture system in an existing or new (Greenfield) SWDS where no LFG capture system was or would have been installed prior to the implementation of the project activity.• Flaring the LFG and/or use in supplying the LFG to consumers using trucks and/or for electricity generations.Hereinafter the first project activity instance of this Grouped Project will be referred to as ‘Project 1’ throughout the document. Interwaste’s FG Landfill Gas Project (project 1) consists of landfill gas recovery from horizontal and vertical gas collection systems at the FG Landfill site. The recovered gas will be processed in a gas cleaning and upgrading facility to a compressed biogas fuel which will be used by external customers, the excess gas will be flared. The technology to be installed as part of the gas cleaning facility is an aerodynamic separation process (ASP) and a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plant, in addition an enclosed low height flare will be installed.Greenhouse gas emission reductions for Project 1 will be achieved by the combustion of recovered methane contained in landfill gas that would otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere, and/or from the production of compressed biogas (CBG) and its use thereof to displace natural gas. Prior to project implementation the site was a landfill site which included no gas recovery system nor a gas flaring system, thus the baseline scenario is the venting of landfill gas to the atmosphere. The landfill site started collecting and handling waste in 2008.The estimated annual average emission reduction saving for this Project 1 is 37,633 tCO2e and total GHG emission reductions and removals over the lifetime of the crediting periods are 413,965 tCO2e.",Gauteng Province,"Interwaste (Pty) Ltd

Ntakata Mountains REDD,"The Ntakata REDD project was initiated in May 2017 by Carbon Tanzania, a registered Tanzanian company headquartered in Arusha. The overall aim of the project is to engage and support local communities in the protection of their village forest reserves in order to contribute to the conservation ofimportant wildlife habitat and to mitigate climate change. The project is located in Tanganyika District, in Western Tanzania, an area experiencing dramatic landscape changes over the past decade, with detrimental effects on forests and critically important species such as chimpanzee. Chimpanzees rely on large expanses of forest to maintain their ‘fusion fission’ social patterns whereby troops split up and form new groups on a regular basis. Sufficient forest habitat and corridors to facilitate movement throughoutthe landscape are vital. Threats to these forest habitats include slash and burn agriculture undertaken by a steady influx of migrants from all parts of Tanzania as well as from across the country’s Western border.In addition, grazing by pastoralists, mining, and the development of new infrastructure (e.g. roads) negatively impact the forest, with consequences for water resources and livelihoods as well as for wildlife conservation.Carbon Tanzania, in partnership with the District Government, has identified 8 villages to collaborate with, and the Village Land Use Plans (VLUPs) of these villages form the basis for identifying the forest landscapes to be protected under the project. These VLUPs have been prepared through a participatory process and are legally binding documents forming a key input for village development planning. However, the implementation of these plans is substantially under-resourced; this is where the NtakataREDD project plays an important role in channelling carbon finance to support patrolling and other activities to enhance sustainability of the resources.An equally important goal is to work in partnership with local communities in order to have positive impacts on their livelihoods. Carbon Tanzania works with the Village Governments as the primary interface, thus utilizing existing governance structures. Carbon Tanzania (CT) will train and provide compensation to Village Game Scouts (VGS) to conduct regular patrols of the forest. Additionally, overall governance in the landscape is improved through support to the Village Government in the form of training and contributions to the village development budget. Other livelihood-related interventions include training and demonstration of climate smart agriculture techniques and reproductive health services, among others.As a result of the implementation of a range of project activities, the Ntakata REDD project is estimated to generate approximately 420,200 tCO2e in GHG emissions reductions on an average annual basis.",Tanganyika District,"Carbon Tanzania

Makame Savannah REDD,"Carbon Tanzania seeks to combine elements of conventional integrated conservation and development projects (ICDP) with a “payments for ecosystem services” (PES) approach when designing and implementing the Makame Savannah REDD project. REDD has at times been conceived narrowly as simply a system of conditional performance-based payments (PES)12. Projects developed by Carbon Tanzania are similarly premised on performance-based payments, but we have gone further in developing anapproach to project implementation that recognizes the part that can be played by tried and tested interventions. These include participatory land use mapping, boundary determination, development of land use plans, clarification of tenure, income generating activities, employment and community development.Following the principles of community-based natural resource management (CBNRM), the key underlying assumption of the Wildlife Management Area (WMA) concept is that providing local communities with economic benefits and involving them in the management13 of wildlife resources found in their areas will promote both the long-term health of wildlife, protect habitat and create rural economic development.Communities will thus have a vested interest in the conservation of natural resources because they benefit directly from sustainable management. WMAs were formally adopted as an approach for involving communities in wildlife management. WMAs can provide local residents with benefits through associated enterprises that sustainably utilize either wildlife or other natural resources in the WMA.The Makame Savannah REDD project will protect the Makame WMA from land grabbing and encroachment, and the conversion of land from forest to agriculture, thereby stopping deforestation and preventing GHG emissions generated through tree harvesting and clearing land for agriculture. In doing so the Masai communities living within the WMA will receive improved land tenure, grazing rights and significant income. This REDD project protects the southern extension of the Tarangire-Manyara ecosystem and in doing so protects significant biodiversity and megafauna, both resident and migratory.PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD:This project was open for public comment from 14 June – 14 July 2019.",Kiteto District,"Carbon Tanzania

Guizhou Dongyijing CMM Power Generation Project,"Guizhou Dongyijing CMM Power Generation Project (hereinafter referred to as the Project) is located in Songhe township, Pan County, Liu Panshui City, Guizhou Province, China. The purpose of the Project is to utilize the extracted CMM with low concentration methane concentration to produce electricity. No coal bed methane (CBM) or ventilation air methane (VAM) utilization is involved. The CMM power generation units will be installed with a total installed capacity of 6.0MW, destroying 10.66 million m3 of methane annually. 
After the full operation of the Project, the annual exported electricity will be 28,200 MWh, which will be supplied to the coalmines through the electricity distribution network in Songhe coal mine area, replacing the electricity that would otherwise have been purchased from the CSPG. The waste heat from the generators will be recovered by waste heat boilers to provide free hot water to the coal mines, which was provided by waste coal fired boilers before the implementation of the Project.
It is estimated that in the 10 years crediting period of the project (from 08-May-2019 to 07-May-2029), the average annual GHG emission reduction will be 174,220 tCO2e, with the total emission reduction of 1,742,200 tCO2e.",Guizhou,"Liupanshui Zhongding New Energy Development Co., Ltd.

Monet Forest Conservation Project,"In 2007, Solifor Bloc Monet S.E.C made the acquisition of a vast forest property designated as the Monet forest block, located in the province of Quebec, Canada. Although the main purposes of this acquisition was oriented towards logging activities, Solifor Bloc Monet S.E.C has suspended the annual harvesting operations since 2016 to analyze the opportunity of creating a conservation easement to fix more carbon in the forest pool.
 
The current project is a VCS Improved Forest Management (IMF) – Logged to Protected Forest (LtPF) conservation project aiming at preserving intact the whole forest property by preventing logging on a productive forest area of 10,614 ha (26,228 acres). The project longevity is set at 60 years. 
Since 2016, the conservation project scenario has generated GHG emission reductions by allowing the biomass of standing trees to fix more CO2 than the baseline scenario. With the baseline scenario, carbon is emitted in the short term following tree removal, by decomposition of logging slash and combustion of bark, and in the long term by gradual release of the carbon fraction sequestered in the harvested wood products over time. 

The most plausible baseline scenario is an annual sustainable harvest level of 12,900 m3 of merchantable volume of softwood and hardwood, as modelled in the annual allowable cut (ACC) calculation. By preventing this annual harvest, the project scenario carries net cumulative GHG emission reductions of 72 885 tCO2e over the first 10 years with buffer deduction, 151 038 tCO2e over the first 20 years with buffer deduction, and 287 018 tCO2e over 60 years with buffer deduction, compared to the baseline scenario.",QC,"Solifor Bloc Monet S.E.C.

The project preserves and conserves the mangrove forest of around 64,000 hectares in a critical region of the threatened biodiversity hotspot Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena of Colombia. A region where there is high deforestation risk. The project has quantifiable CCB benefits, as it has generated and provides full time employment, training and access for the families that live in and around the project area, also created to be self-empowered in a region where there are few job opportunities. The project has also provided cookstoves with chimneys to help mitigate lung related diseases (which is the most common disease in the surrounding area due to improper cooking methods) and more efficiently burn fuel for cooking. Also, the company is intensifying and improving its practices to support the sustainable social development, maintaining and improving the biodiversity monitoring at the project area in the framework of REDD activities.

From the implementation of this REDD Project, it is estimated that 4,600,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions will be avoided which would have been emitted into the atmosphere in a period of 10 years in the absence of the project.",Choco and Antioquia,"WeAct Pty Ltd.

Green Gold Loreto 1,"Green Gold Forestry will take 183,455 ha of its production forest concession area out of the planned logging cycle and into management for ecosystem services. Within the project boundary, baseline logging will cease, together with the establishment and maintenance of logging roads, skidding trails and other infrastructure. Thereby, emissions will be eliminated from the extraction and processing of logs, from collateral mortality of felling operations, and from roads, skidding trails and other infrastructure. The forest will be protected from disturbance, reducing emissions from logging operations and allowing carbon content to accumulate over time, taking advantage of the overall trend of carbon accumulation in Amazonian forests. Any negative effects that biodiversity may have experienced from logging operations will be allowed to recover.  
The project will work with surrounding communities to establish an active conservation program for their benefit and for that of the climate and the forest’s biodiversity and ecosystem health. Jobs will include forest rangers, eco-guides, research and monitoring assistants and other support staff. Forest rangers will regularly patrol the project area, particularly its fluvial access routes, to detect and deter illegal logging, hunting and encroachment. The project plans to develop the area as a prime destination for ecotourism and scientific research, establishing a lodge and research station within the first five years.

FOÇA BIOGAS ENERGY POWER PLANT,"The proposed project activity is a biogas-to-energy project that will generate renewable energy by capturing biogas from cattle manure -via anaerobic digestion- and utilizing it to produce thermal and electric energy through cogeneration systems. The project is being implemented by ENERGROM A.Ş. in the Foça district, İzmir province, in Turkey. 

Agricultural activities have been a main household income source for those living in Foça. While the number of stockbreeders and poultry farms has substantially increased for the last years in the region, cattle manure generated at farms has, however, become a major environmental, economic and legal problem for cattle breeders and poultry farmers, as well as for the local people living around farms. 

The proposed project activity provides an environmentally friendly solution to this manure management problem. 

Approximately 337 tons of cattle manure and 100 tons of chicken manure generated at farms in the region will be collected daily through special sewage trucks equipped with close-tanks in order to prevent any odor and/or manure leakages and to be fed into the anaerobic digesters at the proposed biogas power plant.

Within the scope of the planned project, biodegradation of organic wastes coming to the Biogas Plant in an anaerobic environment will take place. The biogas that will be released during the biodegradation of organic wastes will be used for electricity and heat production in the cogeneration units. The cogeneration system to be installed will be designed with a total power of 3.2 MWe/h, the electricity to directly fed to the national grid. 

The proposed project activity will generate around 331,795 tCO2eq/y emissions reduction annually, mainly by preventing GHG emissions from being emitted directly to the atmosphere from cattle manure that would be otherwise left to decay in aerobic conditions.

REDD+ CONSERVATION OF ETHNO SUSTAINABLE AFRO-COLOMBIAN COMMUNITY IN THE TROPICAL RAIN FOREST OF COLOMBIA,"This project is an Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) project under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) project category. Specifically, the project is of the “Avoided Unplanned Deforestation” (AUD) project category.

The project preserves and conserves the native tropical rain forest of around 10,433 hectares in a critical region of the threatened biodiversity hotspot choco-magdalena of Colombia. A region where there is high deforestation risk. The project has quantifiable CCB benefits, as it has generated and provides full time employment, training and access for the families that live in and around the project area, also created to be self-empowered in a region where there are few job opportunities. The project has also provided cookstoves with chimneys to help mitigate lung related diseases (which is the most common disease in the surrounding area due to improper cooking methods) and more efficiently burn fuel for cooking. Also, the company is intensifying and improving its practices to support the sustainable social development, maintaining and improving the biodiversity monitoring at the project area in the framework of REDD activities.

From the implementation of this REDD Project, it is estimated that 660,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions will be avoided which would have been emitted into the atmosphere in a period of 10 years in the absence of the project, not including the project’s non-permanence risk buffer contribution.",Choco,"WeAct Pty Ltd.

Serra do Sudeste Landscape Restoration and Reforestation Project,"The Serra do Sudeste Landscape Restoration and Reforestation Project (‘Project’) is a VCS AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Lands Use) project (scope 14), falls specifically under the ARR (Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation) category and uses methodology AR-AMS0007. 

The project goal is the reforestation of degraded lands, which would continue to remain degraded, and would become increasingly more degraded, in absence of the project. The project aims to restore natural biodiverse forest and produce crops through agroforestry in other areas. This is done through Assisted Natural  Regeneration (ANR). A secondary goal is to expand in the region. In this case, the first farm will serve as a hub to be able to scale to adjacent farms and acquire more land to add to the project.

The farm has been used extensively for cattle ranching and has an average livestock load of 600 cows. As a result, the land has been rid of its vegetation and the soil quality is gradually decreasing. The environmental damage and the decline of economic viability of the business as usual, has caused the owner to consider a sustainable strategy. 

The project is located in Brazil – Municipality of Bagé, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The total area of the project is 1.037 hectares and is privately owned by the Titton family (‘Owner’). An estimated 458 ha is suitable for reforestation. The project is expected to generate GHG emissions reductions through reforestation of degraded grassland. Biomass growth in the project area is expected to sequester. Also, following out the strategy a total of 244.565 tonnes of CO2 is to be sequestered by reforestation of native forest. This results in an average annual amount of 8.152,2 tonnes of CO2. The crediting period lasts 30 years and runs from March 1, 2021 to February 28, 2051.",Rio Grande do Sul,"The Green Branch

Virginia Coast Reserve Seagrass Restoration Project,"The Virginia Coast Reserve (VCR), managed by The Nature Conservancy’s (TNC) Virginia State Chapter, encompasses protected lands and coastal bays of the Virginia Eastern Shore that constitute the longest expanse of coastal wilderness remaining on the United States East Coast. This area is owned by the Commonwealth of Virginia, under authority of the VA Department of Environmental Quality. The VCR Seagrass Restoration Project, initiated in 2015, involves the restoration of seagrass meadows at the VCR through direct seeding. Seagrass meadows remained absent from the coastal bays of the VCR until the late 1990s. In 1999, TNC and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) began a large-scale eelgrass restoration effort at the VCR. By the project start date in 2015 eelgrass restoration efforts had already maximized natural recruitment, and continued seed additions were necessary to further increase eelgrass extent across the VCR coastal bays. Data collected at restoration plots established by direct seeding revealed a larger habitable area than the natural recruit distribution, indicating that eelgrass extent could reach up to 107 square kilometers with continued seed additions. Direct seeding of restoration plots will continue in the carbon project to further expand seagrass coverage. The University of Virginia (UVA) and VIMS have studied the seagrass restoration effort at the VCR since its inception, increasing understanding of the long-term effects of expanding eelgrass coverage at the VCR and the potential role for seagrass meadows in mitigating climate change. Seagrass restoration directly increases carbon storage in submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and marine sediments, enhancing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission removals from the atmosphere. Over the 30-year crediting period the project activity is  estimated to generate 40,486 t CO2e net GHG emission removals.",VA,"The Nature Conservancy

Afforestation in cooperation with local landowners for Forestal San Pedro S.A,"The proposed VCS grouped project “Afforestation in cooperation with local landowners for Forestal San Pedro S.A” represents one of the first major afforestation projects of the private sector in Paraguay. 
Forestal San Pedro is a company established in 2019 by an International forestry Fund. The company aims to establish and manage an area of 8,000 ha of sustainable forest plantations for the sequestration of carbon and the production of quality timber in Eastern Paraguay. 
Forestal San Pedro seeks to cooperate with local medium and large landowners to conduct tree planting on their properties. As a diversification strategy, plantations are largely established in silvopastoral systems on traditional cattle farms. Landowners lease their land to the company and get a share of the expected benefits. At the same time, they continue using the land for cattle grazing in a manner compatible with forestry. 
The expansion strategy provides an entry point for tree planting in the degraded and deforested landscape of Eastern Paraguay, dominated by cattle grazing and mechanized soy production. Despite the need to develop new models that can address environmental degradation and climate change, while at the same time offering a sustainable supply to the national wood and timber market, the tree component is still far from integrated into the regional productive landscape. 
Target production areas encompass areas deforested decades ago that have been used for implanted pastures and mechanized soy, but are now degraded. The project is interesting for cattle ranchers that need to integrate sustainable intensification into their extensive grazing models to remain competitive in the area. It is also a good opportunity for landowners having experienced a decrease in agricultural productivity due to the marginal suitability of their land for mechanized agriculture.","San Pedro, Canindeyu","Forestal San Pedro S.A.

Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation in Tongcheng City,"The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Tongcheng City, Anhui Province of China. Anhui Province, located in eastern China with a total acreage of 13,228ha for double-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the backward continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission removal than the continuously flooded. 

This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48% . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 4.54 tCO2e/ha for double-cropping rice is expected. 

The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 1,258,341 tCO2e in 21 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 59,921 tCO2e.

This project aims to:
-	Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;
-	Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;
-	Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers;
-	Invest a part of profit to improve the local medical care;

Integrated Project for Reforestation and Agroforestry on Degraded lands in Nicaragua,"The proposed ARR VCS project plans to reforest and rehabilitate a total area of 4,204 hectares until 2030 in Nicaragua. Since 2016, 677 hectares of pure teak (Tectona grandis) and, to a lesser extent, cocoa agroforestry systems (Theobroma cacao) have been realized (incl. 2020). This area was realized in the northeast of Nicaragua, in the Autonomous Region of the North Caribbean Coast (RACCN), specifically in the municipalities of Siuna and to a minor extent in Bonanza and within the limits of the buffer zone of the BOSAWAS Biosphere Reserve (RBB), approximately 315 km from the capital of the country Managua. The realized plantations form the first instances of this grouped project. The project foresees a gradual expansion of planted area starting with 100 to 200 hectares per year, adding new project areas to the project within the same area of the RACCN, Nicaragua. After a final harvest of the teak, the area is replanted – this rotation cycle is to continue endlessly. 
The forestry initiative was born in 2008 Bonanza and was managed by Norteak Madera until 2015. Since middle 2015 MLR took the management control of the Project with a different vision, focused on an agro-forestry project combining teak and cacao crops.
The total current area of the properties of MLR is 5139.55 ha. Of this area, 2315.71 hectare is included in the actual VCS project (areas 2016-2020). The project plans to expand to a total VCS project area of 4,204 hectares (Ha) until 2030, of which 2,567 hectares are commercial plantations, mainly in the Municipality of Siuna, according to the availability of area, labor and other necessary elements, that allow the expansion of the Project in degraded areas.

Yellow Ipê Grouped REDD Project,"The Yellow Ipê Grouped REDD Project is located in the municipalities of Novo Aripuanã and Borba, south of Amazonas state, in the Northern region of Brazil. The Trans Amazonian Highway BR 230 is located in the south of the project region and, along its route, cattle raising can be found, which is one of the many agents to deforestation in the region.

The primary objective of the Yellow Ipê Grouped REDD Project is to avoid unplanned deforestation (AUD) of a specific region within the municipalities of Novo Aripuanã and Borba. The first Project activity instance has an area of 86,091.66 ha, as it is part of two private properties in Novo Aripuanã, consisting of 100% Amazon rainforest. However, other REDD project instances can be added into this grouped project activity in the future, as long as they comply with the eligibility criteria defined by the methodology and of the VCS Standard.

Besides the ecological and carbon benefits of the project, a proportion of the carbon credits generated will be dedicated to improving social and environmental conditions for the local community around the project area, specifically contributing to environmental education and other social activities. The contribution to sustainability is being monitored applying the SOCIALCARBON® Standard, which is based on six key indicators: Biodiversity; Natural; Financial; Human; Social and Carbon Resources.

This REDD project is expected to avoid a predicted 27,228.38 ha of deforestation, equating to around 16,205,376 tCO2e in emissions reductions over the 30 year project lifetime (01-March-2020 to 28-February-2050).",Amazonas,"Ecológica Assessoria Ltda.

Carbon fixation project associated with LtPF conservation scenario of riparian strip enlargement,"This improved forest management (IFM) project was developed by the Cree First Nation of Waswanipi (CFNW) for both objectives: 1) added carbon fixation from trees and 2) enhanced wildlife habitat protection from logging activities. This project started in 2016 and consists in improving Cree standards to protect more areas while decreasing commercial harvesting on their land to achieve more greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions. The project area represents the new conservation areas (enlarged buffer strips) under the improved Cree standards whose total area is 3 879 hectares (ha), excluding areas without merchantable and operable timber volumes. The project boundary represents Category I lands of Waswanipi located in the province of Quebec, Canada, whose total area is 60 358 ha. Prior to 2016, harvesting operations have been implemented throughout the project boundary for many years in respect to provincial and Cree standards. In 2016, thanks to the potential financial incentive to be granted through the sale of carbon credits, the CFNW adopted a new land-use plan, known as wildlife concerns, extending most of the buffer strips of riparian zones of previous Cree and provincial standards, therefore prohibiting harvesting activities in the project area. Simultaneously, the CFNW significantly reduced the harvest level in the project boundary. Both measures have had a negative impact on the earnings of the CFNW from stumpage fees. It is expected that the project scenario will generated GHG emission reductions by allowing the biomass of standing trees to fix more CO2 than the baseline scenario, where carbon is emitted in the short term by short-lived biomass fraction decomposition, wood waste combustion, logging slash decomposition, and in the long term by gradual emission of the carbon fraction sequestered in the harvested wood products over time.

OKI REDD+ Project,"The Project consists of forest protection activities, including emission reduction in the mangrove forests of about 11,650 ha (REDD), and afforestation activities of about 11,840 ha on bare land and grassland (ARR) in a protected forest of about 23,500 ha in Organ Komering Irir, South Sumatra, Indonesia.
The main ecosystems of these two regions are mangrove forests and grassland, bare land and shrub land, respectively, which are separated by boundaries.
Mangrove forest in the region has been severely affected by forest deforestation caused by the conversion to shrimp ponds since the beginning of 1990’s. Mangrove forest in this region had decreased by about 540 ha (9787 ha to 9248 ha) from 1990 to 2012, while bare land area had increased by about 1200 ha (450 ha to 1685 ha). 
In this project area, the impacts of construction of artificial waterways to transport materials necessary for activities in adjacent industrial forests, the spread of fire due to fire outside the project area, and the development due to misidentification of unclear boundary line with outside the project area can be seen. In mangrove forest areas in particular, there has been a large number of small-scale activities for the development of shrimp aquaculture ponds and the logging for that, and these activities are a major cause of deforestation in this area.
This is evident from field surveys, satellite image analysis and interviews. This trend is also gradually expanding in the areas adjacent to the project area, and if the situation continues, the deforestation of the protected forests is likely to continue. Originally, the project area is a protected forest, and cutting down for shrimp farming is prohibited, but in this area, it has been conventionally carried out for livelihood, and the law is not generally observed.
The project will reduce CO2 emissions by taking appropriate preventive measures for drivers and curbing the progress of deforestation. In addition, where there is an old aquaculture pond, the silvo fishery method will be used to plant trees while preventing leakage.
The purpose of this project is to prevent further deforestation by providing local people with alternative means to support the lives of them such as opportunities for participation and cooperation in forest conservation and afforestation projects. Therefore, as a result of communication with local residents focusing on the sustainable development of the local society for many years before the start of the project, a deep relationship of trust has been built, and participation and cooperation in the project by them have been actively carried out. These include the organization of farmers' groups, forest patrols and afforestation activities.
 The monitoring of carbon storage is carried out by the combination of satellite image analysis and field measurement (ground truth). Landsat images are used to classify land cover. Field measurements are also made to identify the actual vegetation and to obtain data to estimate the carbon factor of the forest in the project area. It is estimated to contribute to an annual reduction of approximately 57,000 tons of CO2 emissions. On the other hand, the amount of CO2 absorbed by afforestation activities is estimated to be at an average of about 180,000 tons per year from 2022.

Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation in Nanling County,"The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Nanling county, Wuhu City, Anhui Province of China. A total acreage of 12,976 ha for double-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the backward continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission removal than the continuously flooded. 

This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48% . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 4.62 tCO2e/ha for double-cropping rice is expected. 

The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 1,259,706 tCO2e in 21 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 59,986 tCO2e.

BDU II trust funds comprises 20 properties or plots located in the Central East region of Uruguay (the host country), with a total area of 14,657 ha of which, 9,363 ha are effectively planted. The unplanted area, 5,404 ha, remaining in part as natural grasslands, are used for cattle grazing and flora and fauna conservation. Given that an important portion of BDU II trust fund effectively planted area had already established plantations (8,307 ha) when the trust fund started to operate, they cannot be included within the VCS project boundary. 
The BDU II project eligible for the VCS standard is circumscribed to 1,056 ha effectively planted after the trust fund operation starting date, carried out in 6 properties (5 entire plots and 29% of the 6th one). 
The project activity is carried out on lightly degraded land as a consequence of many decades of intensive cattle grazing. This degradation is expected to continue in the absence of the project. 
The project utilizes two species: E. grandis and E. dunnii that occupies 74% and 26% of the planted area, respectively. 
The project contributes to the sustainable development of Uruguay, specifically by:
•	Increasing labour demand from the local population
•	Adding value to wood products and diversifying the regional production will lead to higher economic revenues for the region.
•	Promoting an integrated management scheme with the ecosystem.

Avoided Conversion Cerrado,"The Cerrado biome, the main breadbasket of Brazil, is classified as a tropical wet and dry grassland/ savanna. Since 1985, the Cerrado biome has lost 46.8% of it’s native vegetation to agriculture. Conversion of native vegetation is predominantly occurring in private lands in the Cerrado biome because of Brazilian land-use regulation. The central piece of legislation regulating land use and management on private properties is the Brazilian Forest Code (Law No. 12,651, of May 25, 2012)  and requires that landholders maintain a percentage of native vegetation on private lands. Currently, many landholders have surplus native vegetation in conservation on their land then legally required. According to the data calculated by Soares-Filho et al. (2014), there is approximately 40 million hectares of surplus native vegetation in the Cerrado that could be converted.
Most landholders do not receive payments for ecosystem services to maintain the native vegetation, therefore, the only economic alternative is to convert native Cerrado for agricultural purposes. This results in landholders being incentivized to convert native vegetation to produce commodities, as the opportunity cost is higher. The consequence is ecosystem conversion, biodiversity loss, water loss and increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Avoided Grassland Conversion Cerrado Program was launched as a grouped project to provide an alternative for landholders with surplus native vegetation to receive payments for conservation by leveraging the voluntary carbon market. The main agent of conversion, the private landholder, foregoes their legal right to convert native vegetation, and in doing so avoids GHG emissions.",Goais,"ERA Assessoria e Projetos Ambientais e Agricolas Ltd.

Afforestation and restoration of degraded forests in Eastern Paraguay or Forestal Azul Carbon Project,"Forestal Azul S.A. is a company established in 2018 by a German investor (family office) in cooperation with the UNIQUE group. The aim of the company is to establish sustainable reforestation and forest restoration in Eastern Paraguay for the sequestration of carbon and the production of quality timber in a highly deforested landscape. 
Forestal Azul purchased a property of 2,309 ha in the Department of San Pedro, Eastern Paraguay, in 2018. As most private estates in Eastern Paraguay, the property had undergone intense land use conversion in the past and maintained around 25 % of its surface covered with natural forest, which by then was highly degraded due to unregulated extraction of biomass and poles, hunting, and fires. The condition of the natural forest was not good enough to initiate viable sustainable forest management. As so many other forest fragments in similar condition in the region, these forests are very vulnerable to forest fires. The risk is exacerbated by the lack of incentives for active forest protection and the changing climate that has been displaying longer droughts in recent years. 
Forestal Azul seeks to establish sustainable forest land use systems adapted to the condition of the land, while at the same time financially viable and competitive. The land use system envisaged by the company is highly diversified and includes the restoration of degraded natural forests, the introduction of silvopastoral systems on implanted pastures, and fast growing eucalypt plantations on the areas used for mechanized soy production.",San Pedro,"Forestal Azul S.A.

Huaining Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation,"The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Huaining County within Anqing City, Anhui Province of China, with a total acreage of 13,005 ha for double-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission removal than the continuously flooded. 
This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48% . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 4.46 tCO2e/ha for double-cropping rice is expected. 
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 1,218,861 tCO2e in the first 7 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 58,041 tCO2e.

Agri-SMART: Sustaining a resilient and inclusive development in Zambezia,"The project supports a resilient and inclusive development of the districts of Lugela, Derre, Namarroi and Gilé in Zambezia (Mozambique) through the adoption of Sustainable Land Management (SALM) practices in the agricultural landscape with the aim of contributing to the achievement of national food safety targets. The project foresees the establishment of 300 agricultural fields for maize, rice and beans in a total area of around 870 hectares involving small and medium producers. The producers selected for the project mainly practiced itinerant and subsistence agriculture. The project aims to disseminate conservation agriculture techniques that offer many advantages in terms of crop yield and conservation of agricultural soils. 
In particular, the increase in productivity is achieved through the practice of CSA (Climate-Smart Agriculture), which improves resilience, reduces or eliminates CO2 emissions and increases the carbon stock potential of the soil.",Nampula and Sofala,"Carbon Sink Group s.r.l.

Upstream Emission Reductions Through Beneficial Use of Waste Flare Gas Energy at Garnes & Gliko Project,"The purpose of the project activity is to beneficially use the energy of waste flare gas for data processing. The project activity leads to upstream carbon emissions reduction since the beneficial use of the waste flare gas will avoid the use of electricity generated by the fossil fuel dominated United States (US) electricity grid. Liberty Resources Management Company, LLC (Liberty) is one of many oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) companies active in North Dakota in pursuit of light sweet crude oil found by drilling horizontal wells in the Bakken shale within the Williston Basin. Like other companies active in the basin, Liberty has several wells with infrastructure constraints creating challenges in bringing produced natural gas and energy to market. Unlike oil which can be trucked, natural gas almost always requires pipeline to be built to connect to existing interstate pipelines for egress to different marketplaces. Growing production from improving well results, increasing gas-to-oil ratios (GOR) over time, marginal gas economics and issues with surface owners are some of the challenging factors to providing appropriate infrastructure for natural gas delivery. In its place, operators such as Liberty flare the stranded natural gas. Crusoe has set out to beneficially utilize the stranded natural gas that is unable to be brought to market (waste gas) with its Digital Flare Mitigation (DFM) technology. Crusoe’s DFM systems convert natural gas into electricity which is utilized for energy-intensive computing at well sites. DFM systems are comprised of natural gas reciprocating engines, modular data centers, and remote telecommunications components optimized for this specific application.",ND,"Crusoe Energy Systems, Inc.

IMPACT REFORESTATION IN THE CHACO PROJECT,"Investancia Holding B.V., based in the Netherlands, has a local affiliate Investancia Paraguay S.A. based at Estancia Santa Rosanna in Carmelo Peralta, Paraguay. Investancia Paraguay S.A. (Investancia) is undertaking a VCS - CCBS grouped reforestation project, known as the Impact Reforestation in the Chaco Project. The Project is planting pongamia (Pongamia pinnata) throughout the department of Alto Paraguay, Paraguay on areas that were cleared of native Chaco forests more than ten years prior to the projects’ start date. In the future, Investancia is likely to expand its reforestation activities into the departments of Presidente Hayes and Boquerón, Paraguay.

The UN-REDD Programme and the United Nations Environment Programme note that:
While the eastern region [of Paraguay] has experienced large-scale deforestation and forest degradation over the last few decades, due to population and infrastructure expansion and the conversion of land for growing soya and for cattle grazing, forests in the Chaco are now under increasing pressure from the expansion of agriculture.

Investancia is developing a business model to establish pongamia as a regional commodity in a region where agriculture, other than cattle-ranching, is extremely difficult to make work. The focus of Investancia’s business is four-fold: 

1) Production of oil from pongamia pods;
2) Allow farmers to maintain cattle with improved pastures;
3) Provide protein (i.e., feed) for cattle from the pongamia pods; and
4) Sequestering carbon dioxide (i.e., generate carbon offset credits).

To date, Investancia has established a nursery, explored the suitability of pongamia in the region, developed protocols, assessed various genetic strains of pongamia, and spoke with numerous local landowners about leasing land.

Initially, the project anticipates planting several thousand hectares of land before scaling up to have a
regional impact with over 120,000 ha of grazing lands converted to a silvopastoral Pongamia forest.",Chaco Region,"Investancia Paraguay S.A.

BONOS DEL JAGUAR AZUL,"The Blue Carbon Project Bonos del Jaguar Azul is the first project in México to be developed for mangroves under VCS program. It is a project which includes in its expansion region all the mangrove and tropical dry forests located in the Yucatan Peninsula,in the Mexican Caribbean. In a report of the study of Mexican Mangroves, published by the National Commission for Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity in 2009 (CONABIO, 2009), it was concluded that the Yucatan Peninsula contains 55% of the total area of mangroves in Mexico with 423,751 ha, of which the state Yucatan occupies 99,640 ha, mostly protected by federal and state decrees. In the Yucatan Peninsula, mangroves are habitat for numerous animal species such as jaguar, crocodile and many water bird specieslike pink flamingo, wood stork, pelican, roseate spoonbill, white ibis and several species of herons. Some of these species are considered endangered or threatened. 

The principal aim is the removals of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through activities that allow the identification, prioritization and execution of actions for the adequate management of mangroves, the advancement of sustainable development, the establishment of local governance and the promotion of another productive activity, while contributing to the protection of high community values of biodiversity conservation.

The Project began on July, 2016 and will have an expected duration of 30 years; during this period, the reduction of 3,278,919 between mangrove and tropical low deciduous forests is expected through the implementation of activities related to four strategic lines: strengthening of governance, alternative productive projects, recovery and rehabilitation of mangrove areas, and monitoring aerial biomass growth.

The whole area managed by MADERACRE SAC, including the current proposed project area and others already VCS/CCB verified, are FSC certified, which guarantees that logging activities are being done under adequate techniques.
The area faces increasing threats from unsustainable agrarian practices from neighbouring local religious communities and others.
To deal with it, the project plans to combine an increase in protection measures (patrolling, working together with other forest concessions and the forest and political authorities) with the promotion of productive activities for neighbouring communities, as a strategy to offer alternative sources of income that do not imply the clearing of forest areas. Based on this approach, the project expects to reduce projected deforestation.

Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation in Xuanzhou District,"The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Xuanzhou District within the Xuancheng City, Anhui Province of China. Xuanzhou District is located in the southeast of Anhui with a total acreage of 14,333 ha for double-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the backward continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission removal than the continuously flooded. 
This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48% . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 4.05 tCO2e/ha for double-cropping rice is expected. 
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 406,448 tCO2e in the first 7 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 58,064 tCO2e.
This project aims to:
-	Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;

"CHINKO CONSERVATION AREA REDD+ PROJECT, CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC","Nestled in Eastern Central African Republic (CAR), lies a wildlife refuge called Chinko. Chinko has emerged as a bright spot for both biodiversity and governance. Prior to African Parks signing a mandate with the Government in 2014, hundreds of thousands of cattle and armed herders overran the park. Poaching and natural resource exploitation were rampant; and the ethnic violence inflicted upon civilians was beyond devastating. Despite this vast bands of wooded savanna and rainforest have remained intact and effective law enforcement efforts over the last years have allowed key wildlife populations to grow, making Chinko one of the largest ecosystems with the greatest conservation potential in all of Central Africa.

Even more remarkable is the life-saving role Chinko is playing for people. In this war-torn corner of the world, Chinko is the only stabilizing force in the entire region for the people who live here.

In a place with little to no economic opportunity, Chinko has remained the largest employer in the region since 2014 with hundreds of people having found employment year after year. Salaries for schoolteachers, doctors and nurses are being provided; and markets have emerged to support Chinko’s staff, fueling a conservation-led economy. For the first time, Chinko’s value is not just being recognised, it is being lived. Local communities as well as the park employees can see their future; they speak of their children’s future, and they talk of a tomorrow that is inextricably linked to the bedrock that is Chinko.",Mbomou,"African Parks RCA

●	Engagement with local communities and management of regional transhumance and local pastoralism across the Parks
●	Support of educational activities, providing school material, school grants and free visits to the local students.
●	The establishment of more sustainable practices
●	Increasement of employment opportunities and Implementations of sustainable Income Generating Activities (IGAs) throughout certain zones of the parks
●	Training and equipping rangers, for maintaining control over the project area, enforcing the law, and protecting forest and grassland areas from illegal human intervention.
The implementation of these activities increases the protection of the ecosystem by reducing the human pressure for natural resources while generating additional incomes for ensuring the long-term funding of the park and employment opportunities for local communities.
Although the project area itself is a national protected area, regardless of its uninhabited, the savanna ecosystems and forests in the project area have faced different threats that put their long-term conservation at risk. Such threats include the following:
●	Pressure from the surrounding communities for agricultural land (self-consumption and cash crops),
●	conflict among transhumant communities and sedentary ones for resources (land for crops and for feeding cattle), 
●	deforestation for producing firewood and charcoal.",,"African Parks Benin (A Branch of African Parks Network)

EVERGREEN REDD+ PROJECT,"The Evergreen REDD+ Project is located in Apuí Municipality, Amazonas, currently the municipality with the 10th highest deforestation rate in Brazil making it a priority area for forest conservation worldwide. The present project continues to build on the success of the Fortaleza Ituxi REDD+ Project and the Unitor REDD+ Project, which have the same project developer and owner, and have provided an important proof of concept for the region. Evergreen’s Project Area sums to 130,554.81 hectares of preserved forest area. Given the deforestation pressures and financial difficulties regarding sustainable economic activities in the Project Area, sale of the farm to private investors is considered the most plausible baseline scenario. In recent years, some of the project landowners have been approached to sell their properties. In this context, the conversion of a portion of the project area to pastureland by the project owners, to alleviate the financial pressure, followed by the regional business-as-usual scenario (BAU) is the most plausible future scenario, involving deforestation beyond Brazilian Forest Code limits and sale of illegal timber, followed by implementation of unsustainable cattle ranching operations.

In this context, the Vjosë-Nartë A/R project, wants to address the CO2 emissions reduction goal, by increasing the carbon stock in the Protected Landscape of Vjosë-Nartë through A/R activities. In order to achieve the objective, 9’302 trees have been planted, in an area characterized by native vegetation, which is nowadays sparse, due to environmental extreme events occurred in the past. After these phenomena, the natural regrowing struggled to be accomplished and hence four different indigenous species of trees were put in the ground:

•	Pinus halepensis:	4’604 specimens
•	Pinus pinea: 		2’420 specimens
•	Populus alba: 		1’143 specimens
•	Laurus nobilis:	1’135 specimens

BRAZILIAN AMAZON APD GROUPED PROJECT,"The Brazilian Amazon APD Grouped Project (GPD) aims the forest conservation on private properties located in the nine states of the Legal Amazon. 
The GPD main goal it is to create positive economic incentives to landowners for the rainforest and Cerrado conservation in private areas, through income generation from carbon credits commercialization.
According to national law 12.651, the Brazilian forest code, landowners must conserve 80% of the forest cover and 35% of the Cerrado areas on properties located in the Legal Amazon.
In this way, the areas with forest cover exceeding this percentage can be legally converted to other land uses for commercial activities such as cattle raising or agricultural projects, with the authorization of the responsible environmental agency in each state.
The landowners who decide to join the initiative, by giving up their right to legally clear their forest areas will be able to access financial resources from the carbon voluntary market, becoming BRCarbon partners. The partnership between BRCarbon (BRC) and landowners will result in legal protection to forests, forest monitoring by satellite images, forest biomass inventory using drones and innovative aero photogrammetry techniques associated with LIDAR technology, property surveillance, wildfire monitoring, prevention and firefighting activities, threatened species protection and social engagement activities with traditional communities living inside the project area.
BRC will be responsible for the development, implementation, monitoring and certification of the project instances. The landowner’s counterpart is to allow project activities to be implemented in their areas, in addition to freely committing to their long-term conservation.
In this way, BRC expects to escalate the climate impact promoted by the implementation of carbon projects, bringing positive net benefits to communities and biodiversity.",,"BRCARBON SERVICOS AMBIENTAIS LTDA

REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE IN RICE-WHEAT-MAIZE SYSTEM FOR INCOME GENERATION,"The Rice-Wheat-Maize system in North-West India accounts for a significant portion of the food supply in the country. Depletion of underground water, declining fertility status associated with multiple nutrient deficiencies, increased concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere owing to soil methanogenesis from rice cultivation and burning of rice residues are some of the end results of the intensive system. Thus, there is a challenge to balance the food production and sustainability goals simultaneously. Recent advancements in regenerative agriculture methods improve environmental outcomes without negatively impacting yields. However, agronomic, and socio-economic factors such as access to agro-advisory and the cost of technology adoption remain a crucial barrier to adopting regenerative agriculture practices. By linking smallholder farmers to carbon marketplaces, this project aims to overcome these critical barriers to adoption by enabling additional income opportunities. The project will cover the states Punjab, Haryana, and the adjoining National Capital Region (NCR), and primarily focus on the Rice - Wheat - Maize cropping system, without excluding other crops, with regenerative agricultural practices that are known to reduce GHG emissions and thus generate carbon credits by way of CO2e and SOC. With a cash incentive, the smallholder farmers in the project boundary will adopt these practices more readily and contribute to sustainability and reduce GHG emissions. A voluntary carbon marketplace for carbon credits, for the first time will create income opportunities for smallholder farmers in India via this project.",,"Grow Indigo Private Ltd

"Experimental regeneration of diverse forests on abandoned pastures in Panguana, Peru","Panguana is the oldest biological research station in Peru (founded in 1968) with a focus on studying the immense biodiversity of the Amazon rainforest. The research station is located on the western edge of the Reserva Comunal El Sira (RC El Sira), a national protected area established to protect the pristine montane rainforests of the Cordillera El Sira. The buffer zone of the RCS and its surrounding area is mainly populated by indigenous communities and small-scale farmers. Intensive deforestation in this area in favour of pastures has resulted in fragments of primary rainforests existing primarily as islands between pastures. In this respect, the private nature reserve of Panguana currently forms a peninsula with an intact connection to the untouched rainforests in the heart of the RC El Sira. Restoration of degraded pastureland and rehabilitation of secondary forests adjacent to existing old growth forests at Panguana presents the opportunity to conserve an important biodiversity corridor as well as an effective strategy for rehabilitation of degraded tropical forest across the region.
The project has the following main goals:
    • Restore natural rainforests on pastures within the area of the Panguana foundation (~140 ha)
    • Accelerate forest restoration by testing different approaches and developing best practices for local conditions
    • Introduce sustainable food and tree production systems (permaculture, aquaponics, tree nursery)
    • Only use inexpensive materials and methods, easily available in the region
    • Exchange knowledge and develop a sustainable landscape management together with local stakeholders (indigenous communities, small-scale farmers, local institutions)

It is expected that the project activities will lead to a mean annual removal of ~16 t CO2e per hectare during the first 20 years.",Department of Huánuco,"Panguana Stiftung

Yayasan Sabah is a State-owned para-governmental charitable foundation that was formed in 1966 with the aim of ‘improving the lives of Malaysians living in Sabah’. 
Prior to the start of the project, the project area was designated as production forest (Class II). The area had been repeatedly logged in the past and was designated for further commercial exploitation. Project additionality is explicitly demonstrated by preventing 84,000 hectares of commercial logging over 30 years. Had the project not intervened, the resulting carbon emissions over this period would have contributed 16 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) into the atmosphere. 
In addition to its contribution to preventing the release of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the project is protecting an important biodiverse habitat, Despite its ex-logged state, the area is known to support very high populations of elephants, banteng and orangutan, and endangered bird species including Helmeted Hornbill, Bornean Peacock Pheasant and Storms Stork.",Sabah,"Permian Malaysia SDN.

Unitán afforestation and reforestation of grazing lands project,"The project activity “Unitán Afforestation and reforestation of grazing land project” (hereafter, “Unitán project”) is an afforestation project on extensive cattle grazing pastures area and abandoned agricultural lands using native (Schinopsis balansae) and exotic species (various varieties of Eucalyptus including Eucalyptus gxc) aiming to produce, as a priority product, logs for tannin industry and secondarily, fuelwood. The afforestation with this species will prevent the use of timber from native forests in the future.

Unitán comprises 5 properties located in Chaco and Formosa province, in the NorthEast region of Argentina (the host country), on lightly degraded grassland as a consequence of many decades of extensive cattle grazing and abandoned agriculture land by previous owners. This degradation is expected to continue in the absence of the project. The area of grasslands to be effectively planted and to be included within the Unitán project boundary is then 2,403ha (72.1% of Unitán total area). The unplanted area remaining in part as grassland and native forest remains, become biological corridors used for flora and fauna conservation.

From September 2016 until the time of PDD elaboration, a total area of 939,3 ha of the project was effectively planted. In addition, there is an area of 1,464 ha of planned plantation for the period 2021 to 2025 (mainly in owned and a minor part in leased lands).  In total, the project will have a final scale of about 2,400 ha.

The project utilizes two main species: Schinopsis balansae, a native species, and Eucalyptus (different varieties: mainly gxc and cloeziana), occupying 36%, 64% of the total planted area, and with rotation periods of 40 years, 6 and 20, respectively.",Chaco and Formosa,"UNITAN SAICA

CORAZÓN VERDE DEL CHACO PROJECT,"Quadriz Paraguay S.A. is teaming with Atenil S.A., a large landowner in the Paraguayan Chaco to undertaking a Verified Carbon Standard and Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standards (VCS – CCBS) avoided planned deforestation project, known as the Corazón Verde del Chaco (“Green Heart of the Chaco”) Project. While the initial project instance is approximately 32,000 hectares (ha), it is the intention to scale this grouped project to over 200,000 ha of privately owned land. 
By undertaking this conservation initiatives Quadriz Paraguay S.A. and Atenil S.A. will alleviate pressure on natural forest habitat in the Chaco Region in Paraguay. The Corazón Verde del Chaco Project will mitigate deforestation pressures in the region by using a combination of environmental programs and social programs which are intended to improve the livelihoods of community members living in the vicinity of the Project Area. Social projects and programs for the local communities, will not only generate sustainable economic opportunities, but will also result in a reduction in deforestation in the region and help in the preservation of biodiversity.
Over the Project Lifetime, the Corazón Verde del Chaco Project will implement the following project activities:
•	Forego Clearing and Conversion of the Project Area to Pasture;
•	Provide Healthcare Services;
•	Raise Project Awareness;
•	Patrol and Monitor Deforestation; 
•	Establish a Project Headquarters; and
•	Monitor Biodiversity and Wildlife in the Area.
The project is the first large-scale carbon project in the Chaco region, which conserves tropical forest under immediate threat of deforestation.
The Chaco is one of the largest carbon sinks; nonetheless, it ranks as one of the most deforested forested forest areas in the world. The area covered by the Corazón Verde del Chaco Project contains vital wildlife corridors, and has been described by Sir David Attenborough as “one of the last great wilderness areas in the world.”",Presidente Hayes Department,"Quadriz Paraguay S.A.

Jinjia Jiayi CMM Power Generation Project,"Jinjia Jiayi CMM Power Generation Project (hereafter referred to as “the Project”) is located in Xiaochong Village, Pan County, Liupanshui City, Guizhou Province, People’s Republic of China.The purpose of the Project is to utilize the extracted coal mine methane (CMM) with a low concentration of methane to produce electricity. No coal bed methane (CBM) or ventilation air methane (VAM) utilization is involved. 

Six sets of CMM power generators are installed with a total installed capacity of 3.6 MW (6×0.6 MW). When all six power generators are in full operation, the Project is expected to export 17,280 MWh of electricity and destroy 7.2 million m3 (under normal conditions ) of methane every year. The generated electricity is supplied to the coal mines through the electricity distribution network in the Jinjia coal mine area; part of the electricity produced by the Project may also be exported to CSPG if there is any electricity surplus after the coal mine demand is fully met, thus displacing part of the electricity generated by CSPG dominated by fossil fuel-fired power plants.

The Project achieves emission reductions in two aspects: 1) it reduces methane emissions by capturing and destroying methane which would have been directly vented into the air in the baseline scenario; 2) it reduces CO2 emissions by displacing part of the electricity that would otherwise have been supplied by CSPG.",Guizhou,"Guizhou Panjiang CBM Development&Utilization Co., Ltd.

COMACO Landscape Management Project - West,"This project description document covers COMACO operations in Muchinga and Central provinces of Zambia. The COMACO Landscape Management Project (CLMP) promotes sustainable agriculture and forest management. The key objectives of the project are to increase smallholder farmer agricultural productivity, provide alternative livelihoods and reduce uncontrolled forest loss and degradation. Hence, the project comprises two components:
1. Sustainable Agricultural Land Management (SALM) component – which aims to promote widespread adoption of agricultural practices including conservation agriculture that increase food production per unit area and farmers’ income. The project promotes the adoption by farmers of legume-based alley cropping, residues management (e.g. mulching; cessation of residue burning), and reduced tillage among other SALM practices.
2. REDD+ (Avoided Unplanned Deforestation) component – which aims to reduce forest loss, and protect and expand areas under natural forest, and conserve biodiversity. This is achieved primarily through land use planning and creation of Community Conservation Areas (CCAs), coupled with sustainable non-extractive forest use, e.g. honey and mushrooms.  
The geographical area of the project stretches across sixteen (16) chiefdoms in nine (9) districts in the Central and Muchinga Province of Zambia, namely: Mulilo, Chikwa, Chifunda, Muyombe, Katyetye, Nkula, Chibale, Kabamba, Chitambo, Mukungule, Chikwanda, Mpumba, Kambombo, Lundu, Tembwe and Mubanga. It is a grouped project as defined in the VCS Standard (version 4.0); this project activity instance comprises 19,059 ha of agricultural land for the SALM component, and 131,491 ha for the REDD+ component. The potential project area for the SALM component is estimated to be about 81,500 ha of agricultural land, and for the REDD+ at 300,000 ha of forest.  
Prior to the project, poor farming practices such as residue burning, shifting cultivation and chitemene agricultural system (the cutting and burning of tree branches) led to rapid soil nutrient depletion and the traditional practices of collecting caterpillars (Lepidoptera), a butterfly/moth larva which is a traditional delicacy to the local people and largely consumed in urban areas of Zambia, involved cutting down trees or their branches leading to forest degradation. Uncontrolled and unregulated charcoal burning and cutting down of trees for wood fuel also contributed to deforestation and forest degradation. There was also a general lack of land use planning and forest management, undertaken in a participatory and coordinated manner – which led to destruction and fragmentation of the natural forests. The COMACO Landscape Management Project uses market incentives to promote adoption of SALM practices for forest and wildlife conservation. It uses land use planning with traditional leaders and communities to identify and zone areas for conservation and forest management known as Community Conservation Areas (CCA). A Community Conservation Plan (CCP) is developed and implemented for specific CCAs – including activities for sustainable forest management. These activities will result in increased and sustainable agricultural production, and forest conservation. Greenhouse gases (GHG) emission reductions will be generated through improved carbon storage on farms, and avoidance of mosaic deforestation from unplanned agricultural land conversion. The project activities will be supported by methodologies approved under a VCS approved GHG program to account for the project’s emissions reductions.
The annual average GHG emission reductions of the project are estimated at 147,925 tCO2-e, and total GHG emission reductions over 20 years are estimated at 2,958,500 tCO2-e. This estimate considers only the first 10 years of GHG emission reductions for the REDD+ component.",Central and Muchinga provinces,Community Markets for Conservation (COMACO),,Under validation,147925,,,Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use,ALM; REDD,"VM0015,VM0017",131491 Hectares,,AENOR International S.A.U.,,"1st, 01/07/2017 - 30/06/2027",,,,,,2618

Huiluo Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation,"The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Huishui County and Luodian County, Guizhou Province, where located in southwestern China with a total acreage of 19,066 ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and emission reduction than the continuously flooded.
The project activity includes cement ditch construction, reservoir construction and necessary training for the farmers to help them conduct the intermittent flooded water regime during rice cultivation, which replaces the traditional continuously flooded method. Controllable irrigation and drainage according to the needs of rice growth can not only save water resources, but also reduce methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions (flooded state). In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%. Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 2.80 tCO2e/ha is expected.
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 373,660 tCO2e in the first seven-year period, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 53,380 tCO2e.

Feitian 11 & Dabatian CMM Power Generation Project,"Feitian 11 & Dabatian CMM Power Generation Project (hereafter referred to as “the Project”) is located in Zhijin County and Nayong County of Bijie City, Guizhou Province, People’s Republic of China which involves two power plants which utilize low concentration coal mine methane (CMM) for power generation to supply electricity to the coal mines and to China Southern Power Grid (CSPG) if there is any electricity surplus.

The purpose of the Project is to utilize the extracted CMM with a low concentration of methane to produce electricity. No coal bed methane (CBM)  or ventilation air methane (VAM) utilization is involved. CMM power generators with a total capacity of 6 MW are to be installed for Feitian 11 power plant, and 2 MW for Dabatian power plant, totaling to 8 MW for the Project. It is estimated that the two power plants will destroy a total amount of 17.1 million m3 (under normal conditions ) of methane and export 39,360 MWh of electricity every year, when all power generators are in full operation. The generated electricity is supplied to the coal mines through the electricity distribution network in the coal mine area, replacing the electricity that would otherwise have been purchased from CSPG; part of the electricity produced by the Project may also be exported to CSPG if there is any electricity surplus after the coal mine demand is fully met, thus displacing part of the electricity generated by CSPG dominated by fossil fuel-fired power plants.

The Project achieves emission reductions in two aspects: 1) it reduces methane emissions by capturing and destroying methane which would have been directly vented into the air in the baseline scenario; 2) it reduces CO2 emissions by displacing part of the electricity that would otherwise have been supplied by CSPG.","Bijie City, Guizhou Province",Multiple Proponents,,Registered,307867,,,Energy industries (renewable/non-renewable sources),,ACM0008,,,Tuev Nord Cert GmbH (Tuev Nord),22/09/2022,"1st, 02/01/2021 - 01/01/2031",,,,,,2639
Great British Sustainable Farming Project,"The “Great British Sustainable Farming Project” (GBSFP) from One Carbon World (OCW) aims to raise farmers' awareness on the benefits of regenerative agriculture and how changes in agricultural practices can help in climate change mitigation and adaptation. In order to achieve this objective, the project activity consists of several regenerative agricultural land management practices to reduce and remove GHG emissions.

The project is developed as a grouped project within the United Kingdom (UK) boundaries. The project activity intends to add more instances over the upcoming years. The expansion of the project activity will depend on the allowance of the project validation and the project activities instances will have to follow the program eligibility criteria for its inclusion. The project implementation results in an increase of soil organic carbon and a reduction of GHG emissions. 

“Regenerative agriculture” refers to farming and grazing practices that aim to reverse climate change by rebuilding soil organic matter, sequestering carbon, improving degraded soil biodiversity, improving water cycle and restoring soil fertility. Regenerative agriculture does not imply only one practice, it is a combination of techniques. The project activity, based on this type of agriculture, consists of a package of practices that change the pre-existing agricultural management activities that are carried out in the farms, these activities include but are not limited to:
- Reduce fertilizer application
- Improve water management/irrigation
- Reduce tillage/improve residue management
- Improve crop planting and harvesting (e.g. agroforestry)
- Improve grazing practices.",,"One Carbon World Ltd.

ecoTrees AG – Paulownia Tree Plantation Management in Romania to Sell Wood Production and the Carbon Offsets,"For over five years, ecoTrees AG has been developing and managing Paulownia tree plantations located in Romania. The purpose is two-fold, to create an investment of fast-growing timber trees on previously unused land and reduce global CO2 emissions.

This project will sell wood production and carbon offsets.

Currently, ecoTrees AG manages more than 500 hectares of land in different sites around Romania. We have begun afforestation of 100 hectares with Paulownia trees with ecoTrees AG directly owning more than 60 hectares of Paulownia plantations with the continued expansion every year.

Moreover, we are offering our Swiss customers the chance to participate in our business model. We help them to set up a plantation with a complete management program that includes:
- Finding the land
- Planting the trees
- Managing the trees until harvesting
- Harvesting the trees
- Selling the wood for them

At this moment, we are already managing around 40 hectares for Swiss customers.

ecoTrees chose Romania because they promote afforestation efforts where all plantations use lands degraded and neglected agricultural areas. No new growth forests are touched.

The Paulownia tree is also known as the Kiri, Kaiserbaum, Emperor Tree, and Blue Bell. This wood’s properties have proven to be an excellent choice for noble wooden decks on boats, mouldings, skis, instruments, and furniture production.

The Paulownia tree hybrid we use thrives particularly well in the Central and Eastern European climate. The typical planting density is 700 - 750 trees per hectare. The plantations also help hold the soil and offer work for local inhabitants.

The massive size of the leaves helps trap carbon dioxide more than most tree species. One hectare of Paulownia absorbs about 50 tons of CO2 per year. We estimate that 100 hectares of Paulownia can absorb 5,000 tons of CO2 per year",Dambovita County,"ecoTrees AG

"Soil carbon improvement Project through Grassland Management, in South Africa","The proposed project aims to remove GHG by implementing Sustainable livestock grazing management and controlled fire over multiple grasslands of different provinces in the host country Republic of South Africa. In the baseline scenario, the pastures are larger and the livestock movement less frequent, allowing for unrestricted and selective grazing of perennial grasses. Loss of perennial grasses in grassland ecosystems results in soil loss and erosion, soil carbon loss, reduced water filtration capacity, and reduced productivity of forage.  The Project Activity i.e. 'planned grazing and controlled burning' will increase the rest and rotation on pastures above baseline practices. Smaller pastures implemented by fencing with more rotations allow the recovery of perennial grasses, which foster greater carbon inputs, higher retention of carbon as lignin and cellulose, and greater belowground production. This results in the sequestration of GHGs from the atmosphere into the soil. 

The project has been designated as a ‘Grouped Project’ and plans to increase the number of project instances over a period of time. The first instance includes four land areas Kwazulu Natal
(KZN, 6866.2 ha), Eastern Cape (EC, 71546.64 ha), MPL (3810.4 ha) and “Free State” (11281.9 ha) and this first instance aims to recover around 93,505 ha of land degraded by unrestricted grazing and uncontrolled fire through the implementation of planned rotational grazing and controlled burning.  The overall purpose of this initiative is to develop soil carbon storage through improved grassland management and expected to result in significant removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, as documented using the VCS methodology, “VM0026 – Sustainable Grassland Management”.",Multiple provinces,"WeAct Pty Ltd.

Regenerating Soil Life with waste management,"The project is an innovative integration of industrial composting and increasing carbon stocks in soil. The proposed grouped project was implemented by Ambipar Environmental Solutions within the first instance located in the South of Brazil. The annual average estimation of carbon accrual is 2,337 tCO2e and 38,397 tCO2e of reduction.
Compost application in soil has the potential of contribution to the carbon cycle, where simple nutrients that return to the soil are converted by plants into organic compounds engaging sustainable agricultural land management. 
Soil carbon accrual per unit area is measured in both baseline and project scenarios based on the spatial coordinated sampling gathering data on soil carbon concentration with statistical rigor. The project activities were designed to improve soils, including changes to agricultural practices, compost application and enhance biodiversity in soils. The measurement of the stable SOC concentration was set up to quantify soil dynamics at depth. The soil layers up to 80cm were sampled to estimate changes in carbon stock, excluding the top-soil 20cm.
Prior to the implementation of this project, rural producers do not foresee regenerative agriculture due to the lack of knowledge and technical skills about how to switch to organic input, biological control of plagues and sustainable land management. The previous scenario within the project area outcome low productivity per area, soil degradation and no smart application of the compost provided through the waste management, which implied in deposition applications without potential reuse for climate change mitigation.
Nowadays, this waste gets into the circular economy by its smart reuse and social and environmental positive influence. Ambipar manages great volumes across Brazil for about 50 industrial customers. Built on the raised potential for inclusion of new project activity instances, this grouped project brings up attractive engagement for high carbon landscapes.",,"Ambipar Group

The project’s aim is to restore the local degraded grassland ecosystem by seeding grass and building fence on the degraded grassland, increase carbon sequestration and contribute to local development by introducing sustainable grazing and management of grassland. 
The project covers Gaotai County, Shandan County, Mingle County, Sunan County, Ganzhou district and Shandan Racecourse. According to the baseline survey, before the implementation of the project, the grassland in the region has been facing serious degradation and even desertification due to the impact of climate change and human activities. 
Totally, 261,059.80 ha of degraded grassland have been managed scientifically by fence building and reseeding of local high-quality forage. In general, rest grazing and rotational grazing are implemented in slightly degraded areas (the total grass yield decreased by 30%-50% compared with that before degradation), and reseeding is implemented in severely degraded areas. Besides these main restoration measures, the project also alleviate soil desertification and restore grassland vegetation to improve soil carbon storage and local biodiversity through grassland management measures, such as daily management measures from other protect projects like rodent and pest control and grassland fire prevention to ensure the long-term sustainable management of the project area. The project is estimated to generate GHG emission removals of 29,440,243 tCO2e in 40 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 736,006 tCO2e.",Gansu,"Zhangye Academy of Forestry Sciences

Saving Colombia's Cloud Forest,"The tropical Andes are among the most vulnerable places on earth due to the dual impacts of climate change and human population pressures. With the intense and historic livestock activity in the area, deforestation in the valleys north and south have almost completely isolated the eastern forest. The remaining habitat is an oasis of biodiversity and one of Colombia’s many national treasures. The region also contains two important watersheds: the Río San Juan Antioquia, and Río San Juan Bravo Chocó.  These watersheds provide critical ecosystem services to communities living and working throughout the area and the forests are vital to protection of the headwaters of these important sources of fresh water to the surrounding communities. Without them, landslides, silting, and flooding threaten the health and safety of thousands of residents. 

As our planet’s climate systems continue to be altered, it is highly likely that some or many of the species found in cloud forests will be lost forever. The effects of climate change are already apparent here. As a result, many cloud forest species have started to migrate upslope to maintain a favorable climate. However, their routes are often blocked by a degraded and fragmented landscape caused by agriculture moving up the mountainside and penetrating deeper into the lowlands.   

Our goal is to create a large, protected area for endemic and threatened species to shield them from imminent threats, mitigate climate impacts, and prevent extinctions. Since 2017, we have worked closely with our local partner Fundación Colibri to create a vital connection across a narrow ridgeline. This ecological corridor will safeguard endemic and endangered wildlife and offers important protection for the headwaters of a major river, the primary source of fresh water for communities throughout the region.",Antioquia,"Saving Nature, Inc.

REDD+ Project in Oro Province of Papua New Guinea,"This REDD+ project is located in the province of Oro in Papua New Guinea. The Oro forests are among the most valuable natural resources. These forests support hundreds of rare and endemic species, making this place a “mega-biodiverse” district. These forests are also directly critical to the lives and well-being of most of our people, including the communities in this province. For decades, these areas are under tremendous stress due to logging, shifting agriculture, and plantations. The demand for unprocessed logs from these areas from the Asian market is the biggest cause of forest loss. However, for the past two decades, forest harvesting has occurred in a destructive and ecologically unsustainable fashion. Secondly, a large portion of the forests is being converted to permanent agriculture and long fallow shifting cultivation. In addition, the human population is been tremendously increased in these areas, and hence the dependence on forest resources increased. Due to the increase in the human population, the poverty among the rural areas is also increased, therefore the subsistence farmers respond to the growing needs of the population by various forms of agricultural intensification. This project is an Avoided Unplanned Deforestation and Degradation (AUD) activity. This initiative proceeds with promoting various activities to mitigate climate change and improving livelihoods.",Oro Province,"Kanaka Management Services Private Limited

Guizhou Xintian CMM Power Generation Project,"Guizhou Xintian CMM Power Generation Project (hereafter referred to as “the Project”) refers to a power plant which utilizes low concentration coal mine methane (CMM) for power generation to supply electricity to the Xintian coal mine and to China Southern Power Grid (CSPG). The Project is located in Gantang Town, Qianxi County, Bijie City, Guizhou Province, People’s Republic of China.
The purpose of the Project is to utilize the extracted low concentration CMM to produce electricity. No coal bed methane (CBM)  or ventilation air methane (VAM) utilization is involved. It was planned that CMM power generators with a total capacity of 17.6 MW would be installed for the Project. Based on ex ante estimates, the power plant will destroy a total amount of 35.2 million m3 (under normal conditions ) of methane and export 82,720 MWh of electricity every year, when all power generators are in full operation. The generated electricity is supplied to the Xintian coal mine through the electricity distribution network in the coal mine area; part of the electricity produced by the Project is exported to CSPG after the coal mine demand is fully met.
The Project achieves emission reductions in two aspects: 1) it reduces methane emissions by capturing and destroying methane which would have been directly vented into the air in the baseline scenario; 2) it reduces CO2 emissions by displacing an amount of electricity that would otherwise have been supplied by CSPG.",Guizhou,"Yonggui Energy Development Co., Ltd.

"IMPROVED FOREST MANAGEMENT THROUGH LOGGED-TO-PROTECTED FORESTS AND REDUCED IMPACT LOGGING IN UFA NGOMBÉ, REPUBLIC OF CONGO","The Project “Improved Forest Management through Logged-to-Protected Forests and Reduced Impact Logging in UFA Ngombé, Republic of Congo (IFM - UFA Ngombé Project)” is designed to improve forest management in 583,326 ha of native Congolese forests legally designated for selective logging. The Project is situated within the UFA Ngombé forest concession which is attributed to and managed by the company Industrie Forestière de Ouesso (IFO), owned by INTERHOLCO AG (IHC). The UFA Ngombé forest concession is divided into four Forest Management Units for 1) the production of timber, 2) community development, and 3) protection and 4) conservation of biodiversity. The Project Area includes areas of High Conservation Value (HCV), including swamps and floodplains in connection with some of the largest peatland complexes in the world, the Cuvette Centrale and the Congo Basin peatland areas. These peatlands are essential for carbon storage, as peatlands store more carbon than any other natural terrestrial system. UFA Ngombé also borders the Ntokou-Pikounda National Park which is home to diverse wildlife, including one of the world’s largest western lowland gorilla populations.
The principle activities of the IFM - UFA Ngombé Project are 1) to implement Reduced Impact Logging (RIL-C) to reduce GHG emissions in one or more source categories (i.e., timber felling, skidding and hauling), and 2) to set-aside areas of Logged-to-Protected Forests (LtPF) to maintain and protect ecosystem services in forest production areas legally designated for selective logging.

Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation in Pinghu City,"The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Pinghu City under the jurisdiction of Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province of China, which have a total acreage of 12,545 ha for single-cropping rice. Without this project providing ditches to conduct intermittent flooded method, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission removal than the continuously flooded. 
With the project implementation, the cement ditches, reservoirs and relevant technical training are provided for these farmers to help them conduct the intermittent flooded water regime during rice cultivation, which replaces the traditional continuously flooded method. During rice cultivation, controllable irrigation and drainage according to rice growth requirements can not only save water resources, but also reduce methane emission from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions (in the flooded state). In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48% . Hence, this project activity is estimated to reduce 4.78 tCO2e/ha.

Restoring Mangroves in Mexico's Blue Carbon Ecosystems,"Restoring Mangroves in Mexico's Blue Carbon Ecosystems grouped project (’BlueMX Project’), is a mangrove reforestation and restoration project containing many project instances spread across four Mexican states: Campeche, Nayarit, Quintana Roo and Veracruz.  The project is being developed and managed by BlueMX Mangrove A.C. in Mexico (‘BlueMX’) in collaboration with local community landowners called ejidos (including indigenous communities), private landowners, government agencies and other local partners.  

In total, the project activities will restore approximately 35,000 hectares of degraded mangrove areas thereby removing 31,278,014 tons of carbon over 30 years.  It is an Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) project under VCS and the specific project activity referenced in this Project Design Document is Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR).  

The project instances are located in three different ecosystems: 1) the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico, 2) the Central Mexico Pacific coast, and 3) the Caribbean coastline on the Yucatan Peninsula.  The marshy and wetland ecosystems constitute one of the most important coastal ecological units in Mesoamerica due to their natural productivity and biodiversity. These regions have experienced significant removal and destruction of mangroves through land conversion to other uses, including industry and agricultural purposes (primarily cattle ranching and now palm oil), Aquaculture (shrimp farming), and local infrastructure development, such as road and bridge construction.","Campeche, Nayarit, Quintana Roo, Veracruz","BlueMX Mangrove A.C.

QianJin Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation,"The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Qianxi City and Jinsha County, Guizhou Province, where located in southwestern China with a total acreage of 19,056 ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the backward continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emissions decrease than the continuously flooded.
The implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir construction and necessary training for farmers to help them conduct the intermittent flooded water regime during rice cultivation, which replaces the traditional flooded method. Controllable irrigation and drainage according to the needs of rice growth can not only save water resources, but also reduce methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions (flooded state). In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48% . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 3.11 tCO2e/ha for rice is expected.
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 412,713 tCO2e in the first seven-year period, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 58,959 tCO2e.
This project aims to:
- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes.

Muyuan WJZ AWMS GHG Mitigation Project in Henan Province,"The project introduces new animal waste management systems to treat the manure from 7 swine farms in Nanyang City and Zhumadian City, Henan Province. Each subsidiary swine farm will install one animal waste management system (AWMS), and the manure is treated on site. The purpose of the project activity is to treat the manure and wastewater to avoid methane emissions generated in the baseline uncovered anaerobic lagoons. 
The project activity uses flushing system to collect the manure automatically. All the manure and wastewater are collected and then be separated first. The solid will be treated in aerobic composting system and the organic fertilizers will be produced, the fertilizer produced in this process will be distributed to local farmers for free and the surplus will be sold in domestic market. The liquid will be treated through anaerobic digestion and the biogas generated during the treatment process will be captured for heat generation. The sludge produced from anaerobic digestion will be treated through aerobic composting together with the solid, the effluent will be supplied to the farmers living around free for agriculture irrigation.
It is estimated that approximately 1,637 tons of animal manure will be handled daily by the AWMS. The biogas released during the anaerobic digestion will be collected and used for heat production. The heat production is estimated to be 657,340GJ. Also, the generated heat will be only used for daily operation of the AWMSs and the 7 swine farms themselves and will not be provided to other users. For conservativeness, baseline emissions from heat generation are neglected.
The project activity will reduce of GHG in the atmosphere through avoiding methane emissions from anaerobic treatment of swine manure and wastewater. It is estimated that 321,663tCO2e emission reductions will be produced annually.",Henan Province,"Muyuan Foods Co., Ltd.

Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation In Huangpi District,"The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Huangpi District within Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China, with a total acreage of 13,162 ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.
This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 4.55 tCO2e/ha for single-cropping rice is expected.
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 419,545 tCO2e in the first 7 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 59,935tCO2e.

Boomitra Grassland Restoration in Northern Mexico,"This project works with the ranchers of northern Mexico who raise livestock on individually owned or community-owned grasslands and enables those ranchers to adopt Improved Grassland Management (IGM). Ranchers in this region have traditionally followed practices such as continuous grazing, without any sustainable grazing or water management plans in place. This has resulted in overgrazing, leading to severe soil degradation, loss of vegetative cover and even desertification. When ranchers then become unable to sustain their livelihoods on their degraded ranches, they are sometimes forced to sell their land to farmers who convert the grasslands into croplands, resulting in further CO2 emissions and loss of natural flora and fauna. Through this project, ranchers are adopting new management practices, which include rotational grazing and a variety of water conservation measures. In rotational grazing, livestock are rotated between different sections of a pasture over the course of days, weeks, or months, while other sections of the pasture are allowed to rest. These sections are known as “paddocks”. This practice allows plants to recover and grow in the paddocks that are allowed to rest, and thus allows them to sequester carbon, gradually regenerating the land. In addition, for arid regions like northern Mexico, water conservation measures help increase the availability of water (which would otherwise be lost) for the growth of the biomass, contributing to the regeneration. The livelihoods of the communities utilizing these ranches are improved directly through the carbon credit payments, which provide an additional source of income, and indirectly through the increased productivity of their lands. The regenerated lands also become much less likely to undergo land use change, because the ranchers are better able to sustain their livelihoods. This in turn ensures that crucial habitats for the flora and fauna of the region are protected.",,"Boomitra Inc

Boomitra Carbon Farming South of the Vindhyas,"This project works with the farmers of southern and central India to help them adopt improved agricultural practices such as residue management and enhanced cropping practices that sequester carbon while increasing productivity. This region is largely composed of small and marginal farmers, with each farming just a few hectares of land. As a result, these farmers are highly susceptible to variabilities arising from markets and weather. 
Over the last century, agriculture in the region has undergone a dramatic shift towards intensification. Since the late 1940s, yields of all staple crops have seen a several-fold increase. This increase was necessary to feed a growing population, but at the same time, it led to an increase of 150kg/ha in the amount of synthetic fertilizer applied to farms, along with similar increases in other crop inputs. An intensive agricultural process focused on maximizing yields every year has led to a gradual degradation of the soils of the region, resulting in CO2 emissions from the lost soil carbon. 
In this context, improved agricultural practices provide the opportunity and the power to reverse this land degradation and return carbon to the soil, creating carbon removals while improving overall soil health. In this project, farmers adopt a variety of improved agriculture practices. These practices are proven ways to increase soil organic carbon, and also enable farmers to improve their productivity: increases in soil organic carbon improve the ability of soils to store moisture and nutrients, and thus also help to increase yields. This project works towards helping farmers to surmount their barriers, while working with partners to create feasible and sustainable solutions that effect grass-roots behavior change. Furthermore, the financial benefits from carbon credits will provide a direct boost to the livelihoods of these farmers, many of whom are small and marginal farmers.",,"Boomitra Inc

The VCS Improved Forest Management (IMF) - Logged to Protected Forest (LtPF) project aims to preserve a part of the forest from the exploitation of forest resources, which would anyway be used in the following years as foreseen in the documents approved by the Ministère des Forêts et de la Faune (MINFOF) - Ministry of Forests and Wildlife. The area that will be exempted from the work is approximately 44’413 ha for an estimated volume of 38 m3 /ha of forest not been harvested.
From the implementation of the Project, it is estimated that a net average of 325’885 tonnes of GHG emissions will be avoided from entering the atmosphere annually. Over the entire Project Crediting Period, it is estimated that a net total of 6’517’703 tonnes of GHG emissions will be avoided through the implementation of the Project.",East Region,"CarbonSinkGroup S.R.L.

Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation In Dawu County,"The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Dawu County within Xiaogan City, Hubei Province of China, with a total acreage of 13,430 ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.
This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 4.46 tCO2e/ha for single-cropping rice is expected.
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 419,461 tCO2e in the first 7 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 59,923tCO2e.

Boomitra Carbon Farming in the Indo-Gangetic Plains,"This project intends to help farmers adopt new improved agriculture practices in the Indo-Gangetic Plains of the Indian subcontinent. Improved agriculture practices include crop residue management, natural farming, crop rotations and more, which enable cropland soils to improve their carbon sequestration capabilities. The region contains large numbers of small and marginal farmers who are highly susceptible to reductions in yields arising from climate change, and there is a strong need for programs and interventions to help them adapt.
In this context, improved agricultural practices provide the opportunity and the power to reverse land degradation and return carbon to the soil, creating carbon removals while improving overall soil health. In this project, farmers adopt a variety of improved agriculture practices. These practices are proven ways to increase soil organic carbon, and enable farmers to improve their productivity: increases in soil organic carbon improve the ability of soils to store moisture and nutrients, and thus also help to increase yields. Boomitra’s research has shown that farmers face various barriers in the adoption of these practices, and this project works towards helping farmers to surmount these barriers, while working with partners to create feasible and sustainable solutions that promote behavioral change at the grassroots level. The financial benefits from carbon credits will provide a direct boost to the livelihoods of these farmers, many of whom are small and marginal farmers.",,"Boomitra Inc

The purpose of the project activity is to treat the manure and wastewater from the 10 swine farms to avoid methane emissions generated in the baseline uncovered anaerobic lagoons.

In this project, AWMS is built to replace the traditional open anaerobic lagoons, and each subsidiary swine farm installed one AWMS. The manure and waster will be collected into the anaerobic digesters and then biogas generated during the anaerobic treatment process will be captured and total 2500*104m3 biogas are expected to be generated annually. Biogas is then sent into biogas boilers for heat production. Every biogas boiler has been installed in each swine farms. All of the heat generated are used by AWMSs and the swine farms, while the rest (if any) will be burned. The sludge produced after fermentation is applied to corn fields as fertilizer, and the wastewater produced by anaerobic biogas digesters is used for agricultural irrigation.
Benefited from the “waste-biogas-fertilizer” pattern, harmlessness and ecological utilization of the swine manure can be realized. All the heat generated by the project will be used by the AWMSs and 10 swine farms. 
The project activity will reduce of GHG in the atmosphere through avoiding methane emissions from anaerobic treatment of swine manure and wastewater.

OKA 2 PROJECT,"This savannah Land Afforestation Project on the Batéké Plateau north of Brazzaville aims to develop an alternative and renewable source of charcoal for urban use, based on the establishment of Acacia auriculiformis plantations. Furthermore, Acacia rows will be intercropped with lines of food crops (Cassava in particular), forming agroforestry plantations. 
We also know that another effective tool to combat global warming are 'carbon sink' plantations, i.e. plantations where trees are not harvested, in order to maximize greenhouse gas sequestration in the long term. Half of the project's area will therefore be dedicated to Acacia mangium plantations with the main objective of CO2 sequestration.
These plantations will be set up in anthropogenic savannahs, i.e. land with a biomass stock blocked at a very low stage due to recurrent bushfires. The savannahs are deliberately set to fire at frequent intervals (at least once a year) by villagers to facilitate agricultural, pastoral and cynegetic activities.
As a result, the Project will have several social and environmental benefits such as (1) CO2 sequestration on land that is currently non-forested and unused, (2) Less pressure on the surrounding natural forests, thanks to the production of charcoal from sustainably managed plantations, (3) Job creation in a territory heavily affected by unemployment, increased incomes. As such, the project acts as a driving force of local development and fights against rural exodus or (4) Increased farming production and productivity, contributing to the economic development of local communities.",Batéké Plateaus,"Acacia Bateke Capital

The purchased power by the customers is either consumed/utilized by the customers for in the buildings premises or injected to the grid of the Distribution Utility under the mechanism of net metering.

Under the concept of Net Metering, the customers are charged only for the net power that they consume from the electricity service provider that has accumulated over a specific period. In other words, if their renewable energy generating systems make more electricity than consumed, they may be credited or paid for the excess electricity contributed to the grid over the same period. Net metering is also a way to increase the energy in the power grid to keep up with increase in demand during peak power use times, and this is of particular interest to states facing power shortages.",Multiple States,"SAEL Limited

Patagonia Region Improved Grazing Project,"The Patagonia Region Improved Grazing Project aims to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by implementing improved grazing management on multiple farms in Argentina. It is a grouped project.  The initial activity instances comprise 20,123 hectares that will generate on average an estimated 24,952 tCO2e of emissions reductions annually.  It is expected ultimately to comprise >500,000 hectares and generate on average an estimated 620,000 of emissions reductions annually. Improved grazing will increase the rest and rotation on pastures above baseline practices and reduce unrestricted grazing by livestock. Pastures will be grazed with higher livestock densities followed by longer periods of rest, increasing both plant productivity and soil carbon inputs relative to baseline conditions. This results in the sequestration of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere to the soil. 
Land operators are provided funding to increase fencing and water access needed to create more and smaller pastures and to provide the added labor needed to manage more frequent livestock movements. Project participants are required to manage for concentrated animal impact on small pastures with a focus on extended rest periods allowing for regrowth and recovery of leaf tissue, seed establishment, and replenishment of root reserves. In the baseline scenario, the pastures are larger and the livestock movement among pastures is less frequent. This allows grazing animals to select for preferred perennial species, which then become overgrazed and insufficient rest periods favor the encroachment by shrubs, annual grasses, and larger occurrence of bare ground.
The grouped project is on eligible grasslands of Argentina. The project area consists of grassland grazed by livestock on participating farms. Soils throughout the project area are primarily coarse-textured sand to sandy loam and have been losing carbon for over 100 years due to the continuous, selective grazing under the baseline scenario. Consequently, soils in the project area are modelled to have a high potential to store carbon under intensive, high rotation grazing management.",Argentinian Patagonia,"Native, a Public Benefit Corporation

Keyue Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation,"The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Keqiao and Yuecheng Districts, Shaoxing City, Zhejiang Province of China, with a total of 11,920 ha single-cropping rice paddies. Without this project providing ditches to conduct intermittent flooded method, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission removal than the continuously flooded.
With the project implementation, the cement ditches, reservoirs and relevant technical training are provided for farmers to help them conduct the intermittent flooded water regime, which replaces the traditional continuously flooded method. During rice cultivation, controllable irrigation and drainage according to rice growth requirements can not only save water resources, but also reduce methane emission from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions (in the flooded state). In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%12.
The project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 418,992 tCO2e in the first seven-year crediting period with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 59,856 tCO2e. Hence, it is estimated to reduce 5.02 tCO2e/ha.
This project aims to:
- Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate changes;
- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;
- Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers;
- Enrich biodiversity in rice paddies by enhancing the diversity of weed community.",Zhejiang Province,"Hangzhou Chunmeng Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd

Maraui Program - Grouped Project,"Current research established nine planetary boundaries to define the environmental limits within which humanity can safely operate. Within those, two core boundaries — climate change and biosphere integrity — have been highlighted, each of which has the potential to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed (Rockström et al., 2009; Steffen et al., 2015).
Inspired by a call of action, Maraui Program was designed to act upon the two wicked problems — Climate Change & Biodiversity Loss. Maraui Program intends to halt GHG emissions by avoiding ecosystem conversion while protecting Biodiversity. Furthermore, such a program aims to aid in a range of pressing issues, from preserving Freshwater Resources to improving Traditional Communities’ livelihood. 
The Program is a grouped project - as per VCS definition - located in the states of Piauí and Maranhão, Brazil. Owners of rich Biodiversity, Piauí and Maranhão states are home to one of the most intense agricultural frontiers of the country and are the most poverty-stricken states - the lowest average income in Brazil (IBGE, 2021).

Itaúba REDD+ Project,"The ITAÚBA REDD+ PROJECT aims at protecting forests in one of the regions having the highest deforestation trends in the Amazon Biome, in the municipalities of Itaúba and Marcelândia. Both the municipalities are inside the “Arc of Deforestation” and since the colonization of the municipalities, besides the damage caused to natural ecosystems, several social conflicts have emerged from the dynamics of unsustainable land use, associated with the extensive deforestation and degradation activities. Throughout time, communities with livelihoods based on family-scale agriculture and forest resources were expulsed from the region and gave place to  large scale agricultural and pasture activities.  For the project period, the baseline scenario for the Project Area indicates that the historical patterns of change in land-use would be reproduced: extensive deforestation and systematic conversion from forest to soy crops and pasture areas for cattle ranching, far above the limits stablished by the Brazilian Forest Code. The project activities are designed to avoid the deforestation drivers that would realize the referred baseline in the without project scenario, with the long-term vision of restoring the relation of local communities of rural workers with the forest areas and contribute with the transition to socioeconomic scenario build on bioeconomy principles.

"Tlawan kiwi nak chuchit Blue Carbon Mangrove Conservation Project, Conserving Coastal Ecosystems in Veracruz to Support Life","In Mexico, the mangrove areas in the state of Veracruz are significantly impacted by deforestation.  Among the major drivers of the deforestation in the region, it is possible to identify illegal firewood harvesting, logging, dredging, and real estate development.

According to a previous study made for the project proponent, the average deforestation rate in the state of Veracruz is 1.07% for the period of 2005-2015, while in Alvarado region, within this same state, it was 1.5%/year for the same period.

The Project activity is a REDD+ grouped project that intents to address the unplanned deforestation of wetlands in the state of Veracruz.  Currently, there are 37 project activity instances, each one encompassing wetland areas within ejidos or private land.  In the future, more project activity instances, inside state-owned, private or ejidos’ lands, will be added to this grouped project.

Conservation activities include, but are not limited to, reestablishing canals, maintaining canal structures, soil rehabilitation, deforestation monitoring, and monitoring of biodiversity.

The project proponent has been engaging with communities in ejidos and private lands since 2016 under a participatory and inclusive approach and will also include more properties as the project is developed.  BlueMX is also conducting capacity building sessions and developing outreach and communication materials to empower communities to carry out the conservation activities.

The grouped project totals 4,903 hectares of wetlands and is estimated to reduce approximately 65,946 t CO2e per year.

The Project area is not covered by any jurisdictional REDD+ program.

INDIA CARBON PROGRAM:AWD/DSR,"India is one of the world's largest producers of rice and exporter of rice in the world. Rice cultivation is the most important agricultural operation in India, not only in terms of food security but also in terms of livelihood and plays a major part in the economy. It is a known fact that rice fields emit methane into the environment that contributes to global warming.
The project plans to promote improved water management practices in rice cultivation instead of using the traditional practice of continuously flooded irrigation. AWD/DSR are proven methods to reduce methane emission by as much as 48% compared to flooded conditions where large amounts of methane (CH4) gets generated because of anaerobic decomposition. This project is expected to generate important co-benefits of reducing water usage during rice cultivation, decrease pest and disease attacks, improve soil health etc. Further they are also beneficial for reduced cost of cultivation for small land holders.
In the first instance, the project is planned to be implemented in 8,112 hectares in Punjab and Haryana States.  During the project implementation, relevant technical training and advisory was provided for the farmers to help them conduct AWD/DSR during rice cultivation.

Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.
This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%1 .

Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.
This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 2.88 tCO2e/ha for single-cropping rice is expected.
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 417,662 tCO2e in the first 7 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 59,666tCO2e.

Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation in South Wuhua County,"The main goal of this project is changing continuously flooded irrigation to intermittent flooded irrigation in rice cultivation in the south of Wuhua County, Meizhou City, Guangdong Province of China. Wuhua County is located in east of Guangdong Province. The project includes 4 towns, namely Mianyang Town, Meilin Town, Huayang town and Longcun town, with total double-cropping rice area is approximately 7,127.43ha. Since lack of financial support, it is very difficult to change irrigation method by local farmers. Therefore, the baseline scenario should be recognized as continuously flooded irrigation situation. Due to the anaerobic decomposition, a large amount of CH4 will be produced during continuously flooded irrigation. In contrast, rice paddies intermittently submerged and dried so that the upper soil layers switch from anaerobic to aerobic conditions several times during the crop growing season in intermittent flooded method. Moreover, the intermittent flooded method brings many benefits, such as the higher rice yield production, the higher methane removal rate, etc. In project area, every farmer who owns rice paddy field is regarded as an individual unit. With the project implementation, the cement ditches, reservoirs and relevant technical training are provided for these farmers to help them conduct the intermittent flooded water regime during rice cultivation. During intermittent flooded irrigation, the controllable irrigation and drainage system will be applied, which can not only save water resources but also reduce methane emission in anaerobic condition (in flooded phase).",Guangdong Province,"Guangzhou Kaifeng Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd.

Western Amazon REDD+ Grouped Project,"The WARG Project is an initiative led by Carbon Credits Consulting SRL and a group of landowners in the state of Acre to protect multiple parcels of precious native forest. The project gives landowners with small and medium sized properties the opportunity to participate in a REDD+ project which will bring biodiversity, community, and climate benefits to their land.
The project areas are in the region known as the Amazon deforestation arc and are located in a region of high conversion rates from original forest habitat to pasture and/or large areas of agricultural crops. 
The Brazilian economy in the south of the Amazonian regions, has been based based on native forest clearing to allow cattle-ranching, often without appropriate management technologies. Considering the infertile soil in the Amazon Forest, its exposure to the weather, and to little improvement in agricultural technology the region is hampered by low productivity, leading to increasing deforestation to ensure profitability. 
The WARG project intends to deliver significant improvements in the area’s monitoring, with remote sensing technology implementation to identify any signs of modification in the Project Area and surroundings, in addition to training staff for field monitoring. The project will also be implementing satellite wildfire detection systems and teams of fire fighters to detect fires early before they reach an unmanageable size.
The project is expected to avoid the emission of 3,620,766 tCO2eq in the first 10 years. The actual project area is 60,000 ha of native forest divided in 22 properties, with an ambitious target for continuous expansion to a total area of 500,000 ha.

NIGER DELTA MANGROVE PROJECT,"This is the first Blue Carbon Project of Niger Delta Mangroves. It is a grouped project whose expansion region includes all the mangrove forests present in the Niger Delta in Nigeria. This project is aiming at restoring and sustainably managing the Niger Delta mangroves. Niger Delta mangroves together with the creeks and rivers are a major source of food and livelihood for about 30 million people, which represents more than 17% of Nigeria's population. Other ecosystem services provided by this unique environment are flood control, ground water re-fill, reservoir of biodiversity, fuel wood, cultural values etc. This ecosystem also plays important role in climate change mitigation because of its high blue carbon sequestration potential. Mangroves constitute important nurseries for fishes, crustaceans, sponges, algae and other invertebrates, and also acts as a sink, retaining pollutants from contaminated tidal water. Mangroves are also used as shelter and breeding grounds by small mammals, shore birds, reptiles, and insects. Unfortunately, this unique ecosystem is on the decline and at the verge of been totally lost. Mangrove forests are converted to farmlands and the trees are cut for timber, fuel, house construction and so on. Consequently, many coastal communities in the Niger Delta are losing their lives and primary livelihoods due to increased vulnerability to floods as a result of the disappearance of mangroves which usually serve as defense in times of coastal flooding. They are also now exposed to the high intensity of sunlight and heat waves as the land lay bare of trees to regulate sun rays. There is an urgent need to restore/conserve the mangroves of Niger Delta region. Hence the main objective of the project is sequestration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) through planting activities.",,"everi GmbH

Longchuan Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation,"The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Longchuan within Jiamusi City, Heilongjiang Province of China, with a total acreage of 20,054 ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.
This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 2.92 tCO2e/ha for single-cropping rice is expected.
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 410,347 tCO2e in the first 7 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 58,621tCO2e.
This project aims to:
- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;
- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;
- Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers.",Heilongjiang Province,"Harbin Huanyu Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd.

HENAN SHANGCAI AGRICULTURAL LAND USE MANAGEMENT PROJECT,"The Soil Carbon Project aims at promoting Sustainable Agriculture practices that increase soil organic carbon. In the project the farmers will adopt practices that increase capacity of the soil to sequester increased carbon they will reduce the use of synthetic fertilisers, increase activities that improve soil productivity like increasing the use of organic fertilisers, incorporate residue management, and reduce tillage thereby reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions.
In the proposed project area farmers cultivate corn, peanuts, soybeans, and rice in a no-till manner in June each year and harvests them in October of the same year. Wheat is planted by the no-till method after peanut harvest. After the corn, soybean, and rice harvest, the land will be tilled with less tillage or traditional tillage, including deep ploughing and deep loosening (vertical rototilling). After crop harvest, straw and root stubble will be returned to the land to improve soil organic matter input and enhance soil fertility. In this process, organic fertilizers will replace part of the synthetic chemical fertilizer. At the same time, no-till activities will reduce the consumption of fossil fuels when farmland is tilled.
Through these activities, the project will rebuild the organic matter of the soil, improve its properties and reduce GHG emissions from the implementation of activities such as reducing the use of N fertilizers and fossil fuel. The practices will also restore soil fertility and sequester carbon from the atmosphere, mitigating climate change.
The main objective of this proposed project is to raise farmers awareness and prove to them that there is a way to practice farming methods that are sustainable and positively impact climate change. Such practices can also be profitable to the farmers. The farmers will be assisted with technical advice on how to implement these activities, which will transition throughout the years into a sustainable farm system.",Henan Province,"Xin Ran Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Co.

Yunnan Yulong Afforestation Project,"Yunnan Yulong Afforestation Project (hereafter refer to as “the project”) is located in Yulong Naxi Autonomous County, Lijiang City, Yunnan Province of China, where 37,400.59 ha (561,008.85 Mu) of the forest was planted on suitable land for forest because of poor sustainable ecological environment and rocky desertification. By checking the afforestation plan, it was confirmed that, a small number of trees have been planted in some project area before the project started, but the coverage rate was extremely low. So, considering the lower forest coverage, Yulong Naxi Autonomous County Forestry and Grassland Bureau determined that the project area is suitable for afforestation after investigation, then the supplementary planting without disturbing the existing trees was approved to increase the vegetative cover. All the trees were planted without disturbing the existing trees in this project, and only the trees actually planted in this project were monitored. The carbon credit of the original trees in the baseline scenario will not be monitored or counted in the actual net GHG removals by sinks. 
The project activity aims to:
-	Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate change;
-	Enhance biodiversity conservation by increasing the connectivity of forests;
-	Improve soil and water conservation in the mountainous region and increase the forest cover;
-	Generate income and job opportunities for local communities.
There is no natural renewal and reforestation before the project, and all sites were suitable land for forest. The main objective species are Pinus yunnanensis (Yunnan Pine) and Picea asperata (Spruce) which are native species according to the baseline survey.
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 22,959,273 tCO2e in 30 years from 16-June-2018 to 15-June-2048, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 765,309 tCO2e.",Yunnan province,"Yulong State Owned Capital Investment and Operation Co., Ltd.

ASATIQ Vaupés Maloca REDD+ Project,"The ASATIQ Vaupés Maloca REDD+ Project is located within the area of the Association of Traditional Indigenous Authorities of Querarí (ASATIQ), which is part of the Great Eastern Indigenous Reservation of Vaupés in jurisdiction of the municipality of Mitú, in the department of Vaupés, Colombia. ASATIQ’s territory is located in the Colombian Amazon biome. The objective of the ASATIQ Vaupés Maloca REDD+ Project is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions coming mainly from deforestation and degradation of the Amazon Forest.
Potential activities to reduce deforestation include forest protection and monitoring, the intensification and improvement of agricultural productivity in local communities, planting of fruit and timber trees (including those used for firewood), planting of other species used as construction materials, the creation of jobs as an alternative source of income (for example, in forest monitoring) and the improvement of health and education conditions of the communities in order to offer non-extractive work options.
At the same time, actions in the medium and long terms have been defined to support the territory’s self-governance principles, as well as to promote the development of local traditional practices and ancestral education. The proposals made are framed aligned with the general action lines of the ASATIQ Life Plan.
On the other hand, between 40% and 60% of recent IDEAM deforestation early warning bulletins come from the Amazon, and the department of Vaupés appears in the first five ranks of alert. Under these circumstances, the without-project scenario presents an unplanned use of forest resources with extractive logging activities and the expansion of the agricultural frontier through subsistence crops and itinerant mining, which are being developed progressively putting at risk the ecosystem balance of the forests and the cultural traditions of the communities.
The duration of the project is proposed from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2047.",Department of Vaupés,"Association of Traditional Indigenous Authorities of Querarí (ASATIQ)

ASATRIZY Vaupés Maloca REDD+ Project,"The ASATRIZY Vaupés Maloca REDD+ Project proposed to be implemented in the Great Eastern Reservation of Vaupés is in the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) category. Development of the REDD+ project is based on the VM0009 Methodology, v3 of the VCS. This methodology is applicable to this project and is being used for other REDD+ projects in the region. It has also been used by Wildlife Works, having two types of areas of application.  The first, corresponding to the Project Area (PA) and the second to the Project Accounting Area (PAA). The PAA is the area with forest cover, where the project would implement activities to prevent deforestation and whose results would be used to calculate carbon credits.
According to the territory conditions, this is a standalone project that respects ASATRIZY’s autonomy. In the without-project scenario, the forest ecosystems in the department of Vaupés and in particular those in the territory of ASATRIZY are located in life zones of tropical humid forest. This area has been recognized as one of the most biodiverse in the country and the whole continent, being characterized by its endemic species.
The forest monitoring carried out by the Colombian Government and coordinated by IDEAM has shown a national annual deforestation average between 177,764 ha and 219,552 ha for the 2016-2017 period, with the Amazon biome representing 70% of the total deforestation. In addition, between 40% and 60% of recent IDEAM deforestation early warning bulletins come from the Amazon, and the department of Vaupés appears in the first five ranks of alert.
According to this scenario and based on data obtained from the Amazonian Scientific Research Institute (SINCHI) and through field visits carried out by WWC, it was possible to identify the unplanned use of forestry resources as the main driver of deforestation in the project area, consisting of “slash-and-burn” activities in the jungle to expand the chagras.",Department of Vaupés,"Association of Traditional Indigenous Authorities of the Yapú Zone (ASATRIZY)

BINDONG ADJUSTED WATER MANAGEMENT IN RICE CULTIVATION,"The project aims to reduce a large amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) by changing the water regime from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation. The project is conducted in Suibin County, Hegang City, Heilongjiang Province of China, and involves a total acreage of 19,365ha for single-cropping rice. 
Currently, the farmers in the project area are using the continuously flooded method during the rice cultivation. Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches and technical support to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded method would be continued, which is also the baseline scenario. Within the project boundary, every farmer’s household owning the paddy fields is regarded as an isolate unit. With the project implementation, the cement ditches, reservoirs and relevant technical training are provided for these farmers to help them conduct the intermittent flooded water regime during rice cultivation, which replaces the traditional continuously flooded method.  As the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, after the implementation of the project, the period of flooded condition will be shortened, which will have negative impact on the methane production. It means that controllable irrigation and drainage according to rice growth requirements during rice cultivation, can not only save water resources, but also reduce methane emission from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions (in the flooded state). In this case, CH4 emission during the cultivation can be declined significantly. Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 2.66~2.98  tCO2e/ha for single-cropping rice is expected.
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 559,218   tCO2e in the 10-years crediting period, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 55,922 tCO2e.",Heilongjiang,"Oasis Science &Technology Development( Beijing) Co., Ltd

The main goal of this project is changing the irrigation method from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded during rice cultivation. In 2019, the average annual income of each local household was only 20,703 RMB CNY and rice cultivation is the main way for local farmers to survive. In this case, they lack of financial support to build ditches for implementing intermittently flooded method. Therefore, traditional continuously flooded method still used for rice cultivation, which means there is constant pond water maintained in the field until the harvest drainage. The organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane because of anaerobic decomposition.  In contrast, rice paddies intermittently submerged and dried so that the upper soil layers switch from anaerobic to aerobic conditions several times during the crop growing season in Intermittently flooded method. Moreover, the intermittently flooded method brings many benefits, such as the higher rice yield production, the higher methane removal rate and etc. The project aims to achieve GHG mitigation goal （sustainable development goals）in project zone by utilizing intermittent flooded irrigation method.

Core Carbon Sustainable Rice Productions,"Paddy fields are the most dominant anthropogenic sources of methane to the atmosphere (5-20% of the total emission from all anthropogenic sources ). Anaerobic decomposition of organic material in flooded rice fields produces methane, which escapes to the atmosphere primarily by transport through the rice plants. The annual amount of CH4 emitted from a given area of rice is a function of the number and duration of crops grown, water regimes before and during the cultivation period, and organic and inorganic soil amendments. Soil type, temperature, and rice cultivar also affect CH4 emissions. This CH4 emission-intensive cultivation method will be targeted by the proposed programme, that will involve the implementation of the technology/measures that result in reduced anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in rice cropping soils and thus reduced generation of methane.
The project activity comprises of grouped projects of rice fields implementing the following methods:
 (a) Rice farms that change the water regime during the cultivation period from continuously to intermittent flooded conditions and/or a shortened period of flooded conditions;

Future Soils and Sustainable Farming Initiative - Germany,"Germany's image as an industrialized country is dominated by vehicle and machinery manufacturers as well as producers of chemical products. The agricultural use of more than 50% of the country's land area is usually overlooked, although here too, successful industrial cultivation is predominant. Technical progress in fertilizers and pesticides, agricultural machinery, and cultivation methods, as well as advances in breeding and the yield-oriented transformation of agricultural landscapes have increased yields many times over in the last 100 years. However, an accompanying effect of this growth is a significant impact on the environment and the climate.

To reduce this impact while maintaining high yields, the Future Soils and Sustainable Farming Initiative aims to promote IALM (improved agriculture land management) practices in Germany. Designed as a grouped project under the VCS, the initiative’s purpose is to encourage interested farmers to participate who meet the requirements. As its initial instance, the initiative starts with a farm located southeast of Berlin in the state of Brandenburg.

By applying regenerative practices, the participating farmers do not only support the global efforts to mitigate climate change by reducing and removing GHG, but also make their own soils more resistant to upcoming challenges such as longer periods of droughts or extreme weather phenomena. Furthermore, a significant contribution is made to the conservation and promotion of biodiversity.",,"everi GmbH

Carpathia Forest Carbon Project,"The Carpathia Forest Carbon Project aims for the restoration and full protection of forests in the south-eastern Carpathians Mountains in Romania. Through land purchase and conservation agreements, the project seeks to protect primary and secondary forests in five Natura 2000 network sites and regenerate areas affected by clear cuts, spruce monocultures, and degraded riparian habitats along the mountain rivers.
The Carpathia Forest Carbon Project would create GHG emission reductions by avoiding the release of carbon associated with timber harvesting, road building and other forestry operations that would be expected to be carried out in the baseline (business-as-usual) scenario. Thus, the project includes improved forest management (IFM) practices that convert the logged forests to protected forests through conservation management activities with low level of timber removal for ecosystem/habitat enhancement and risk management in the wider Făgăraș Mountains (Natura 2000 designated site), the Piatra Craiului National Park and the Leaota Mountains. 
The broader vision of this project is to establish the foundations of a new National Park that can be recognized as the European Yellowstone Park (in reference to the Yellowstone National Park in the United States), encompassing the Carpathian Mountains; from the Olt Valley in the West to Piatra Craiului Mountain in the East.
The project area involves the lands owned by Fundatia Conservation Carpathia (FCC) as well as those managed by them and owned by their partners Wildland Ltd, Romfor Sustainable Forestry SRL, Almimax Natura, Dante International and Sanatate & Natura. The forest properties to be considered include 36 forest management plans (FMP).

The forests support hundreds of rare and endemic species, making this place a “mega-biodiverse”. These forests are also directly critical to the lives and well-being of most of our people, including the communities. These areas are under tremendous stress due to logging, shifting agriculture, and plantations for decades. The major causes for forest loss in these areas are due to demand for an unprocessed log from the Asian market and, a large portion of the forests is being converted to permanent agriculture and long fallow shifting cultivation. Besides, the human population has been immensely increased in these areas which leads to poverty escalation, thus the subsistence farmers respond to the growing needs of the population by various forms of agricultural intensification.

Boomitra Grassland Restoration in the Temperate Grasslands of South America Through Soil Enrichment,"This project encompasses the Pampas grasslands (known as La Pampa in Spanish and Os Pampas in Portuguese), which are vast grassland plains spread across the South American lowlands of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay over 750,000 sq. km. These are natural grasslands where livestock production is the key livelihood activity in the region. These grasslands are subdivided into 3 distinct ecoregions: the Uruguayan Savanna, the Humid Pampas and the Semiarid Pampas. Like other grasslands across the globe, these grasslands are under tremendous pressure from anthropogenic activities such as overgrazing and unsustainable grassland management activities. Grasslands in this region are also declining steadily due to changes in land use - the conversion of grasslands to croplands. Overgrazing and land use change has resulted in the decline of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) across the grassland region. 
The project promotes sustainable grassland management activities that will both improve SOC in the soil and improve the livelihoods of the communities utilizing these ranches, directly through the carbon credit payments, which provide an additional source of income, and indirectly through the increased productivity of their lands. The regenerated lands also become much less likely to undergo land use change, because the ranchers are better able to sustain their livelihoods. This in turn ensures that crucial habitats for the flora and fauna of the region are protected.","Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay","Boomitra Inc

The Serra do Sudeste Grouped Project aims to restore forest formations that are diminished due to the expansion of other land use practices such as overgrazing on extensive cattle ranches, intensive agriculture and silviculture systems. The grouped project is located in the Pampa biome in Rio Grande do Sul, south of Brazil. Restoration is attained through forestation activities using primarily native species and includes enrichment planting with valuable species as well as assisted natural regeneration. The overarching goal of the project is to create a natural and biodiverse forest that combines carbon capture with a diversity of other economic functions such as apiculture, sustainable production of crops and exploitation of forest products.",Rio Grande do Sul,"The Green Branch

METHANE EMISSION REDUCTION PROJECT THROUGH INTERMITTENT FLOODING IN RICE CULTIVATION,"Methane emissions through flooded rice cultivation is one of the largest sources of methane into the atmosphere. Approximately 15-20% of annual total methane emissions come from the paddy fields. Methane is a potent gas with a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 28 is significant gas in the context of climate change. Therefore, it is essential to address the methane emissions from the rice farming to mitigate climate change.  The proposed project activity aims at the reducing methane emissions from the paddy cultivation. The project has introduced direct seeded rice (DSR) technique to irrigated rice cultivation.

Hongera Reforestation Project (Mt Kenya and Aberdares),"The Hongera Reforestation Project (Mt Kenya and Aberdares) is a reforestation and afforestation  initiative designed and funded by Dutch Green Business. The Project aims to increase tree cover in Kenya through two distinct strategies: 1) restoring degraded or deforested areas in Kenya Forest Service lands with native species, and 2) planting agroforestry crop trees on individual farms where smallholders wish to benefit from the income that perennial nuts and fruits can provide. In both cases, site-appropriate tree species will be contributing to regional wildlife habitat or corridors, improving water infiltration, controlling erosion, and sequestering carbon, among other ecosystem services. Prior to project implementation, thousands of hectares of Kenya Forest Service land have been degraded or deforested over time, without the financial resources to restore them. In some cases, reforestation efforts have been attempted, but without the dedication of enough funds to guarantee the survival of these trees when threats like livestock grazing must be constantly warded off through employed patrols. The Project aims to change this dynamic by bringing in external up-front investment made possible through the anticipated sale of Verified Carbon Units generated through project activities. Similar financial barriers are faced by individual farmers, many of whom rely on annual crops like cabbage or potato, and do not have the resources to invest in trees that they are interested in.

Nehe Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation,"The project aims to reduce a large amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) by changing the water regime from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation. The project is conducted in Nehe City, Heilongjiang Province of China, and involves a total acreage of 20,245ha for single-cropping rice. 
Currently, the farmers in the project area are using the continuously flooded method during the rice cultivation. Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches and technical support to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded method would be continued, which is also the baseline scenario. As the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, after the implementation of the project, the period of flooded condition will be shortened, which will have negative impact on the methane production. In this case, CH4 emission during the cultivation can be declined significantly. Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 2.87 tCO2e/ha for single-cropping rice is expected per year during the 10-yr fixed crediting period.
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 580,676 tCO2e in the 10-years crediting period, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 58,067 tCO2e.

Arva Intelligence is a producer-first, B Corporation that uses machine learning (ML) and precision agriculture to optimize sustainable practices and profitability for landowners. Arva was founded on the principle of helping farmers and their suppliers make data-informed agronomic decisions, resulting in improved environmental stewardship for the buyers and an increased efficiency in grower operations. Limited access to data and financial risk concerns have been common barriers to adopting regenerative land management practices in the U.S., and the Arva Carbon Ready USA project will bring tools to farmers and ranchers to help them overcome barriers to adoption. Arva provides solutions through its measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification platform and will provide its cloud-based, ML-enabled software to collect, integrate, and validate data from the adoption or expansion of on-field regenerative agricultural practices. Access to low-cost, scalable, agricultural carbon offsets is limited by the industry’s disaggregated digital infrastructure. Arva’s established Carbon Ready program allows farmers to upload field boundaries and run scenarios to determine the GHG emission values for practice changes that result in GHG avoidance/reduction and soil organic carbon sequestration. A project goal is to help growers identify the practices and seed best suited for their land and to overcome scalability challenges. To facilitate the collection of soil carbon measurements and verify location, Arva will utilize its newly developed mobile app. The project is designed as a grouped project within the USA. Arva estimates that this project will result in the removal and/or avoidance of 1,000,000 tons CO2e annually by 2023.

Boomitra Grassland Restoration in East Africa Through Soil Enrichment,"This project helps pastoralists in deploying practices that contribute to the sustainable development of the Savanna grasslands of East Africa. The pastoralists of this region have largely resorted to implementing traditional grassland management methods on their lands. The grazing of grasslands by both livestock and wildlife is widely prevalent, and degradation of land due to overgrazing is a prominent issue. In this context, the opportunity to introduce improved grassland management practices, including sustainable grazing practices, will significantly help the grasslands of the region and restore carbon to their soil, creating carbon removals while improving overall soil health. In this project, pastoralists will be mobilized to take up a variety of improved grassland management practices. These practices are proven ways to increase soil organic carbon, prevent further degradation of the grasslands, and enable pastoralists to improve their productivity.",,"Boomitra Inc

The Last Habitat REDD+ project,"The Last Habitat REDD+ project is located in the Ucayali region, in the central zone of the Peruvian Amazon, one of the regions with the highest rates of deforestation in Peru (31,543.29 ha in 2021). The project area is comprised by two private estates belonging to the project proponent, BAM: the properties of Nuestro Señor Jesucristo with 8,049.87 ha and Selva Maestra with 14,176.13 ha, a total area of 22,226 ha mainly of primary floodable forests.

Located near the city of Pucallpa (Ucayali) and surrounded by deforestation pressures from agriculture, urbanization and others, the project area harbors an extraordinary ecological wealth, being the last habitat or refuge for various species of flora and fauna and a green island of outstanding ecological value. In addition, the are includes several types of valuable forest, among them the aguajales, which are the wetlands with the greatest carbon sequestration capacity in the Amazon, making this an essential ecosystem to conserve.

The Last Habitat REDD+ project is designed under the avoided planned deforestation methodology as this area was originally sold to the project proponent with the authorization to  convert the forested areas in agrarian production lands (camu camu, palm oil, piñon, and cattle ranching). Despite having the legal authorization to carry out traditional productive activities, BAM, with its own resources, has promoted the conservation of these valuable forests and its biodiversity over the years by implementing different strategies and activities such: territorial supervision with technical and legal support, forest surveillance activities, permanent work with communities for improving their capacities in sustainable forestry management, among others. Such conservation efforts will only be feasible and sustainable over time with the support of carbon revenues from the proposed REDD+ project.",Coronel Portillo and Puerto Inca,"Bosques Amazonicos

Developing voluntary carbon market project for Periyar Tiger Reserve in India,"Tiger Reserves are the storehouse of ecosystem services and a majority of rural population depend on forest resources for their day-to-day livelihood. This dependence is in the form of collection of a variety of Non-Timber Forest Produce (NTFP) and collection of firewood and fodder for subsistence and livelihood purposes. Due to this dependence on forest resources and lack of sufficient infrastructure, the local communities venture in the forest areas resulting in degradation of pristine forest and causing human wildlife conflicts. This results in loss of human lives, and wild animals in a retaliatory process. Hence, there is a need to develop a dedicated finance mechanism which shall help in mitigating the conflicts in an efficient way and lead to coexistence and harmony amongst forest fringe communities and wildlife.

TERRRA SANTA,"The TERRRA Santa project of Improved Agriculture Land Management (IALM), according to the VM0042, will implement sustainable practices in all the project sites in order to reduce and remove GHG, support the local community, increase farmer’s income, and improve biodiversity and natural habitat – important pillars of sustainability.
The existing scenario prior to the implementation of the project was aquaculture with the use of on-land fishponds, producing fish for sale in Israel. This has been a common case in Kibbutzim (collective communities, traditionally based in agriculture) in the last 4-6 decades and currently becoming less profitable due to tax removal and cost increases, therefore some fishponds are not productive and left inactive. In addition, fishpond aquaculture makes use of technologies and practices that have large impacts in terms of, for instance, carbon footprint. 
The project will convert fishponds following rewilding concepts to increase biodiversity and vegetation growth using the earth’s “Muscle Memory”.  The project’s GHG removals will focus mainly on: 
I.	Aboveground biomass that will grow back after each harvesting.
II.	Belowground biomass, which is expected to have a high initial removal rate and small continuous increase.
III.	Soil carbon that accumulates continuously as biomass and sediments are added into the soil. 
Through this project, in collaboration with TERRRA, the Kibbutz farmers will be able to utilize the same fishpond areas to grow vegetation. These will mainly be Common Reed (Phragmites australis), Elephant Grass (Arundo donax), Castor (Ricinus communis), and/or other crops, to be harvested and used as fodder and source for renewable energy.
The IALM project is located in North Israel; it includes a portfolio of assets with a total area of around 500 hectares, which are estimated to reduce and remove 22,704 tons of GHG annually and a total of 454,080 tons over a 20 years period.",,"Terrra Santa LTD

Unrestricted grazing is occurring due to a ‘tragedy of the commons’ where communal areas are over-utilized for livestock grazing and knowledge of sustainable grazing practices have lapsed. The project aims to reverse historic rangeland degradation on communal rangelands by introducing rotational grazing through herding and improved animal husbandry, and removing and reducing Greenhouse Gases in the process. Furthermore, project participants will benefit from improved access to livestock markets.",Mpumalanga,"Conservation South Africa

Reforestation of degraded land in Spain,"The proposed ARR-VCS project is a large-scale grouped project centered on the reforestation of degraded lands in Spain. According to the country’s National Action Plan for the UNCCD, approx. 74% of Spain is at risk of desertification and 18% of the land is at high risk of becoming irreversibly desert. This grouped project aims for the long-term restoration of Spain’s forests, achieved through native, mixed-species reforestation that reverses the impact of land degradation, prevents the loss of flora and fauna and improves biodiversity. The planting employs the latest technologies and planting techniques to support the permanent establishment of native forests in predicted bioclimates that may benefit rural communities in time. The long term resilience of forest and vegetation composition will be monitored by an extensive monitoring system to track the effectiveness and resilience of project activities.
The project is managed by Land Life, a tech-driven reforestation company that plants trees at scale to restore degraded ecosystems globally in hubs like Europe, the US and Australia. In Spain, Land Life’s local team based in Burgos ensures the boots-on-the-ground and maintains a close collaboration with local partners and authorities. 
Project activities are implemented and monitored according to approved large scale project methodology AR-ACM0003, with more project instances to be added over the coming years (up to 10,000 ha expected). The first set of project instances covers 167.46 ha of degraded land in Spain, at 4 distinct planting sites: Campos, Pancorbo, Villapadierna and Grisel. To date, a total of 147,369 native trees have been planted in the project areas and these will sequester approximately  49,792 tCO2e over a project crediting period of 60 years. Within this time frame, 40 years are accounted for in each project instance due to land agreement contract terms. The estimated annual average of GHG emission removals is 1,245 tCO2e.",Spain,"Land Life Company B.V.

This would lead to loss of carbon sinks and the negative climatical conditions will be evidence, impacting the social and economic activities of the region.
The carbon project will be managed by Private Afforestation Developers Organisation (PADO) which is an umbrella Organisation of private forest plantation developers in Ghana. They are the legal owners of the plantations located in Ghana; Kumasi at Kwamisa Forest Reserve located at Offinso Forest District within the Ashanti Region of Ghana. The reserve lies midway between Kumasi-Techiman and the Kumasi–Sunyani Road about 35 miles north of Kumasi.

Portland: Regenerative Agriculture & native revegetation on degraded land,"The project includes both revegetation techniques in and around agricultural land, on different lands of the Republic of South Africa, providing resilient systems to protect the agricultural land from extreme weather events. The project proposes both the IALM and ARR methodologies together, at different GIS delineated areas on each project instance (land), the agricultural methodology will incorporate regenerative agricultural practices as well as circular use of by-products from the farm, as well as neighbouring farms. 
The ARR compartment of the project will include revegetation of native flora around the farm, facilitating ecological resilience to the project instance and sustaining pollinators throughout the year. This will be scaled to vegetation unit specific revegetation activities and regenerative agricultural practices as applicable per the Improved Agricultural Land Management methodology of the Verified Carbon Standard. This project intends to look at the system instead of looking on how to apply a methodology onto the land, a larger look at biota and their interaction in applied stewardship.

Restoration and Conservation of Dry Afromontane Forest in the Highlands of Eastern Tigray,"This project activity targets the restoration and conservation of 30,000 hectares of degraded and deforested lands in the highlands of eastern Tigray. The project area is located inside the Desa’a State Forest which is a dry Afromontane forest and lies between the Tigrinian plateau and the Afar lowlands (elevation between 3100 and 900 m a.s.l.), stretching along the Western edge of the Great Rift Valley escarpment of Ethiopia. The fragmented forest covers about 154,071 ha and is the largest Afromontane remnant forest in Tigray. The restoration project consists of active planting, assisted natural regeneration and conservation activities. In addition to the forest establishment and protection activities, soil and water conservation activities are implemented, including stone check dams, hill side stone terraces, trenches, small ponds and micro basins. 
It is a community-oriented project, which means that a participatory and inclusive approach is taken with the aim to improve the livelihoods of local communities. The degradation of the ecosystem in the project area is the result of unsustainable use and management over a longer period. These practices of overexploitation were mainly driven by grazing, firewood collection and timber extraction in a context of insufficient law enforcement and resource use planning. The drivers of deforestation are being addressed through a combination of providing alternative livelihood opportunities and improving management and law enforcement capacities. The recovery of the forest will restore the carbon stocks in the vegetation and the soil. A vital component of the project is the conservation and enhancement of biological diversity and the promotion of assisted natural regeneration. The project will result into an estimated GHG removal of in total 4.746.785tCO2-e over a period of 50 years.",,"WeForest ASBL

Juruá REDD+ Project,"Juruá REDD+ Project is a partnership between Biofílica Ambipar Environment and Amazônia Agroindústria EIRELI, in order to foster forest conservation and the reduction of potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on a local economic development model that values the “standing” forest through the integration of non-timber forest product management and trading of environmental services.

Juruá REDD+ Project is located at Seringal Valparaíso property, in the Alto Juruá region, between the municipalities of Cruzeiro do Sul and Porto Walter, including an area of 24,076 hectares. Juruá River basin is formed by four micro-basins: the micro-basin of Igarapé do Meio, the micro-basin of Igarapé Primeiro de Março and the Igarapé Grande micro-basin, in addition to the Valparaiso river basin (micro-basin) itself, which is the main drainage network of the rubber plantation region.

The purpose of the project is to reduce GHG emissions from activities regarding to conserve the forest and its natural resources, as well as to maintain carbon stocks, through activities that promote the reduction of deforestation in the region, such as the improvement of patrimonial vigilance, the monitoring of land use change and land cover using satellite images and strengthening the management of non-timber forest products. The performance of activities allied to a good project management, with continuous monitoring and evaluation of activities and results, will allow the Project to reach the expected goals and effects.

Therefore, it is expected that Juruá REDD+ Project prevents, by curbing deforestation, about 3,431,971 tCO2e by reducing GHG emissions throughout 30 years of the project. All the proposed activities to curb deforestation will become economically feasible if the management of non-timber forest products is combined with the trading of carbon credits through REDD+ carbon crediting mechanisms.",Acre,Multiple Proponents,,Registration and verification approval requested,99336,,,Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use,REDD,VM0015,24076 Hectares,,Earthood Services Private Limited,,"1st, 31/07/2020 - 30/07/2050",,,,,,3430

10,158.2 ha (152,373 Mu ) of forest was planted on suitable land for afforestation in Guiyang City where used to be poorly sustainable in terms of ecological environment and suffer from karst rocky desertification. Prior to the project, the project area was suitable land for forest, there is no forestry management and the coverage by planting trees is low, and there has never been any activity affecting the local ecosystem . By checking the afforestation plan with the Guiyang Forestry Bureau, it was confirmed that a small number of trees have been planted in the project area before the afforestation project. However, the forest coverage rate is relatively low. Therefore, considering this situation, the Guiyang Forestry Bureau determined that the project area is suitable for afforestation after investigation, then the Forestry Bureau approved the supplementary planting without disturbing the existing trees to increase the vegetative cover. The forest farm and Guiyang Forestry Industry Development Co., Ltd implement the afforestation project, and Guiyang Forestry Industry Development Co., Ltd is authorized to apply for carbon sink projects on behalf of the forest farm, and to implement management activities such as monitoring.

Most of Lomphat land areas are dominated by dry deciduous forest and followed by semi-evergreen and evergreen forest, grassland, traditional crops, ponds, streams and Repos River that are reliable for thousands of endangered, vulnerable, and rare species. LWS has also been marked in recent years with significant impacts of human activities including: deforestation, mining, land conversion for agriculture, forest encroachment, new road construction, hunting and trapping, resettlement and increasing population. To ensure the effective protection of the EPL-LWS, conservation actions need to promote the significance of forests while helping to address and support sustainable livelihood development of the local population.
From 2010 to 2018, the loss of forest cover in LWS has increased by 16.4% or 41,659.30 hectares, resulting in the loss of biodiversity and greater pressures on endangered species. BirdLife International Program in Cambodia (BirdLife) in close collaboration with the Ministry of Environment (MoE) and NGO partners, has supported and lead conservation activities in the region with the focus on capacity development for law enforcement, forest monitoring, preservation of endangered species and facilitating local community participation. In 2018, the project expanded its strategic approach for LWS to incorporate carbon finance, specifically REDD+, which have been defined as the most appropriate mechanism for addressing financial sustainability, refining activities for natural resource management and providing key benefits for community development and livelihoods.

The implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir construction, pumps and valves installation, training, etc. According to the needs of rice growth, farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in the rainy season. In this case, the methane emission can be declined by an average of 48%. Hence, with the proposed project activity, the estimated GHG reduction from rice is 3.06 tCO2e/ha.",Shandong Province,"Gansu Hongmao Agriculture Development Co.,Ltd

The project will assist farmers to overcome barriers that prevent adoption of improved agricultural land management practices and provide technical assistance where needed. The objective of the project is to reduce emissions from agricultural practices and increase soil carbon storage, in order to achieve these, a package of practices that change the pre-existing agricultural management activities will be carried out, the specific activities are one or combination of the following:
•	Reduced fertilizer(organic or inorganic) application;
•	Improved water management/irrigation;
•	Reduced tillage/improved residue management;
•	Improved crop planting and harvesting (e.g., improved agroforestry, crop rotations, cover crops)
       The project activity is located in Guyuan city within the boundary of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, a western province in China. Prior to the start of the implementation of the project, there was no similar sequestration of carbon, removals or net reduction of GHG activities. The baseline scenario is the continuation of pre-project agricultural land management practices, which are common agricultural practices in the project area.

ACABA REDD+ Project,"The ACABA REDD+ Project is located in the General Community Council of the Baudó River and its Tributaries (ACABA) on the Pacific coast of the department of Chocó. The Project contains very humid tropical forest with transition to tropical pluvial forest, and has unique habitat conditions for both flora and fauna. It is considered an invaluable region at the national and international level and is classified as one of the of the most biodiverse hotspots on Earth, characterized by the presence of endemic species. Significant and exponential deforestation has occurred in the region over time, which according to the IDEAM forest monitoring report for the 2010-2017 period was 10,559 ha. This scenario is the caused by a lack of territorial planning, which in turn results in processes associated with wood extraction, the expansion of the agricultural frontier, the establishment of crops for illicit use, unplanned infrastructure, the construction of new road accesses, and itinerant open-pit mining. The project uses a standalone approach and an annual average of 208,556 tCO2e are expected to be reduced with a total reduction of 6,465,226 tCO2e over the project’s lifetime of thirty years. With the implementation of the REDD+ project, the community will achieve the reduction of emissions resulting from deforestation and forest degradation, and thereby environmental and social benefits will be generated. Additionally, economic resources will be available to be invested in the creation of productive opportunities aimed at improving the living conditions of the inhabitants, in alignment with the ACABA ethno-development plan. The Project is eligible under the VCS Program and uses the VM0009, v3 Methodology.

Simple tree cultivation techniques involving planting saplings in the pits with minimum disturbance to the lands have been employed by the selected farmers. 
The villages under the project area predominantly have an agrarian economy where most of its population depends on agriculture. The major agroforestry plantation in these project districts (Keonjhar, Mayurbhanj & Sundergarh) are Asana, Arjuna etc . The planation was done by the farmers and utilized the subsidies to avail the saplings. The saplings do the sequestration of carbon dioxide at faster pace and ultimately reduces GHG emissions. 
The Project Activity will lead to considerable carbon sequestration in the project areas and will contribute strongly to the sustainable development of rural villages involved in the project.
Initially, 6,300 hectares of land has been selected for the first project activity instance. Through carbon sequestration by the planted trees, the project is expected to generate annual average GHG emission reductions or removals of 62811 tCO2e.",Odisha,"Core CarbonX Solutions Pvt. Ltd.

EVI SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE PROGRAM,"The purpose of this grouped project (Program) is to replace the traditional practice of flooded irrigation (baseline) with System of Root Intensification (SRI) technique in rice cultivation (project). SRI is an intermittent wet and dry technique of cultivation which induces positive socio-economic and environmental impacts by reducing water consumption and increasing crop yield compared to baseline. This also results in reduced GHG emission emissions associated with energy use in water pumping and methane avoidance associated with standing water in farm fields compared to the baseline. Increase in yield and reduced water and energy consumption also yields socio-economic benefits to the farmers.  
The first project activity instance (VPA) under the program is located in the state of Odisha in India. In the baseline, farmers were using traditional agriculture practice of rice cultivation and replaced it with SRI in the project activity. The area covered in this VPA is up to 500 hectares. In the project activity, emission reductions happen due to methane avoidance from the farm fields and reduced electricity consumption. However, emission reductions due to methane avoidance alone, are being claimed under the program. It is estimated that 60,000 tCO2e of emission reductions will be generated per annum.",Odisha,"Emergent Ventures India Private Limited

El Espinillar,"The proposed project El Espinillar is located in the Northwestern part of Uruguay and covers nearly 2,956 hectares. The project region has a long history of sugar cane production for the beverage market in Uruguay.  Ancap Beberage and Alcohol Company (Compañía Ancap de Bebidas y Alcoholes S.A – CABA) was a Uruguayan company dedicated to the manufacturing and marketing of alcoholic beverage and liquors. The project region El Espinillar supplied the value chain with irrigated sugar cane production on Government-owned lands. In the early 90s, due to national economic reforms, the land was sold to several private owners with the aim of diversifying and boosting regional productivity. After that, coarse crop (e.g. maize) production with furrow irrigation and livestock farming activities were the main activities in the region. However, these activities were done under unsustainable practices leading to soil degradation. Following the aim to restore the soil, sequester carbon from the atmosphere and increase the yields per hectare, the project was established in 2019, with the focus on planting trees that produce high-value crops such as citrus fruits (lemon, mandarins, oranges, persimmon caqui), avocados, nuts (pecan, macadamia, almonds), and essential oil crops (e.g. eucalyptus). Through the photosynthesis of the newly planted trees, the project generates GHG emission removals up to 4,400 tons annually, while delivering ecological and socio-economic benefits at the same time. To ensure the success of the project activity, the project proponent seeks to establish irrigation systems, implement conservative measures to recover the degraded soil and achieve climate-neutral production. The project area also counts with a small extension of native riparian forest which will remain protected. The project will deliver economic, social, and ecological benefits to the local communities while making a significant contribution to the battle against climate change on a global scale.",Salto,"Kattegat S.R.L.

REPLACING SYNTHETIC NITROGEN FERTILIZER WITH IN-SEASON NITROGEN SOURCES THAT FIX AND SUPPLY NITROGEN TO AGRICULTURAL CROPS,"Through this project activity, Pivot Bio will evaluate the impact of replacing synthetic nitrogen fertilizer with an in-season nitrogen source that fixes and supplies nitrogen to the roots corn and other cereal crops. One such source is nitrogen-fixing microbes which that convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, a plant available form of N, supplying N to the plant during the most critical stages of growth. This treatment offers unique advantages over synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, including consistency (microbes do not leach or volatilize during weather events), accessibility (biological nitrogen fixation occurs on the root of the crop, making N readily available to the plant), and resiliency (microbes produce nitrogen throughout the growing season, matching N availability to crop needs).  Microbes can replace synthetic nitrogen fertilizer by fixing and supplying N to cereal crops in-season, allowing growers within the project boundary to apply less synthetic nitrogen on the field.  Lower applications of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer have the well-documented impact of reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and in certain cases, growers may also see a reduction in additional GHG emissions from reduced equipment use. In total, the GHG emission reductions from reduced synthetic fertilizer use will be used to generate credits.",MN,"Pivot Bio, Inc.

Udzungwa Corridor Reforestation,"Udzungwa Corridor Limited will reforest 7500 ha of bracken fern thicket on the Eastern Slopes of the Udzungwa Mountains in Tanzania by planting over 100 native tree species.

The project area is largely fallow farmland on steep slopes with no road access. Natural regeneration in the project area is prevented by a dense thicket of bracken fern, occasional cultivation, and hot fires when the bracken burns. The project is signing 30-year leases with the small holder farmers and village councils that own the project lands. The project covers all the costs associated with tree nursery establishment and tree planting and employs hundreds of local community members in the process. To ensure that the planted trees survive, the project is weeding around the planted seedlings 3 times a year for 3 years, clearing fire breaks around the planted areas, and employing firefighting teams.

The project is a 30-year project and will remove approximately 5,322,834 tCO2e over the project lifetime.

The project will greatly improve the local economy in the participating villages through reliable payments for leased land, creating hundreds of well-paying jobs, the provision of avocado seedlings and improved bean seed outside the planting area and funding village development projects. With 30 years of funding already secured by the project, the economic opportunities created by the project will be much more reliable than farming and thus help communities adapt to uncertain climate conditions. 

The project is located in the Eastern Arc Biodiversity hotspot and will create a forest corridor that will reconnect the Udzungwa Scarp and Kilombero Nature Reserves. The corridor will increase habitat connectivity for the endangered Sanje Mangabey, vulnerable Udzungwa Red Colobus Monkey, and several other endangered and vulnerable species.

Core Carbon Sustainable Rice Productions 04,"Paddy fields are the most dominant anthropogenic sources of methane to the atmosphere (5-20% of the total emission from all anthropogenic sources ). Anaerobic decomposition of organic material in flooded rice fields produces methane, which escapes to the atmosphere primarily by transport through the rice plants. The annual amount of CH4 emitted from a given area of rice is a function of the number and duration of crops grown, water regimes before and during the cultivation period, and organic and inorganic soil amendments. Soil type, temperature, and rice cultivar also affect CH4 emissions. This CH4 emission-intensive cultivation method will be targeted by the proposed programme, that will involve the implementation of the technology/measures that result in reduced anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in rice cropping soils and thus reduced generation of methane.
The project activity comprises of grouped projects of rice fields implementing the following methods:
 (a) Rice farms that change the water regime during the cultivation period from continuously to intermittent flooded conditions and/or a shortened period of flooded conditions;
(b) Alternate wetting and drying method (AWD)
(c) Rice farms that change their rice cultivation practice from transplanted to direct-seeded rice (DSR).
Thus, the measure will consist of AWD and/or DSR in combination with adjusted water management system in rice cultivation.

Seringueira REDD+ Project,"The Seringueira Project is implemented in the municipality of Ipixuna, Amazonas State, Brazil. It falls under the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses (AFOLU) sector within the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) category The project will conserve 2,773.79 hectares of native Amazon rainforests in a region where deforestation pressure is mainly due to pasture activities, designated to Planned Avoided Deforestation (APD). For the total area and by the end of the project, it is estimated a total avoided emissions of 1,100,000.00 tons of Greenhouse Gases (tCO2e). The project will be developed considering the CCB Standard, with benefits for Climate, Community and Biodiversity. As benefits to the climate, the maintenance of forest cover results in exceptional benefits for adapting to the impacts caused by climate change, such as changes in the rainfall regime, as the area presents a dense hydrographic network that contributes to the provision and quality of water in the Amazon River basin. As benefits to the communities, the project will implement systems of underground water collection, installation of solar panels for electricity generation, provision of satellite internet service, construction of toilets with septic tanks, training of fire brigades, training of women in entrepreneurship, provision of assistance in the formation of community associations, and construction of a school. These measures will enable water security and access to information to minimize the impacts caused by climate change in traditional, low-income extractive communities.The maintenance of forest cover ensures the conservation of biodiversity, the maintenance of ecosystem functioning (e.g., nutrient cycling) and of ecosystem services provisioning (e.g., carbon sequestration) performed by living organisms.

"Afforestation project with native and exotic species on degraded grasslands in Northeast, Argentina.","The project activity is an afforestation project on multiple farms of extensive grazing lands. The overreaching goal is to promote innovative afforestation management activities on degraded lands. By combining native and exotic species to produce high-quality wood and other non-woody products and, in the long term, to generate new patches of managed native species forests. The grouped Project is located in Corrientes Province, in the Northeast region of Argentina (host country) and could include areas in the contiguous south of Misiones Province.  In this region, grazing and agriculture lands have different levels of degradation due to a long history of use without sustainable management. The activities proposed in the Project could stop the degradation processes and enhance the regional environmental conditions. For the design of the plantations, specific local conditions are considered to determine where species will be planted to promote facilitation strategies between them. Exotic species have favorable competition conditions over native ones (e.g., in standing flooded areas), but in return, they help native species with their development, protecting them from frosts, wind, and high radiation. Through forest plantation of native and exotic species, the Project sequesters CO2 by generating net anthropogenic removals by sinks that can be measured, monitored, and verified with known tools and approaches, contributing to the country's sustainable development.The initial activity instance comprises 2,331 hectares of degraded grassland generating an estimated average (long-term average) of ≈775.509 tCO2e net GHG emissions reductions and removals, implying a total GHG benefit for the environment of approximately ≈19.387. tCO2e per year for the length of the project (40 years).",,"Vista Energy Argentina SAU

REDD+ Café Apuí Agroflorestal,"The REDD+ Café Apuí Agroforestry (CAA) project aims to expand the production chain of agroforestry coffee in southeastern Amazonas and avoid deforestation of native forests on rural properties in the municipalities of Apuí, Manicoré and Novo Aripuanã, in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. In the absence of the project, forests on the participating properties would be cleared for agricultural activities, especially pastures, for income generation.

REDD+ CAA is a 30-year grouped project that will have periodic membership of new participants over the first ten years. The initial project's participants are 42 family farmers (Project Activity Instances – PAI) that totalize a PA of 3.696 hectares around the town of Apuí (50km) in Amazonas State/Brazil. The project has a defined geographical area within which instances of project activities are located, totalling 19,874 km2. This area is composed of native forests and agricultural areas, mainly planted pastures, in addition to some enclaves of non-forest pioneer formations.

The project is based on long-term (30-yr) agreements with landowners to avoid deforestation in their areas in exchange for performance-based payment for avoided deforestation. In addition to monitoring, reporting, verification, and leakage mitigation activities, VCU revenues will be invested in agroforestry implementation, technical assistance, organic certification processes, administration, and marketing of coffee and other agroforestry products. The project aims to expand agroforestry coffee production using agroecological techniques and trained personnel in organic production promoted since 2012 in the region.

The project intends to generate climate, community and biodiversity benefits under CCB standard. The payment for avoided deforestation, investment in the agroforestry coffee chain, and support for the structuring of new agroforestry product chains offer an alternative sustainable income to producers while maintaining conserved forests.",Amazonas,"Amazonia Agroflorestal Comercializacao de Produtos Agroflorestais Ltda

Kalahari Grasslands Project,"Cattle ranching is one of the main pillars of Botswana’s largely agrarian society: livestock is the primary source of subsistence and income for two-thirds of rural households.  Furthermore, Botswana’s urban population is rapidly growing, increasing demand for food, land and fuel. This growth has taken place in tandem with threats to natural resources in the form of  rangeland degradation, loss of grazing habitat, and the over-exploitation of wildlife. The KALAHARI GRASSLANDS PROJECT (KGP) is a grouped project located in the heart of Botswana’s Kalahari, a semi-arid grassland and shrubland ecosystems. Since 2016, Botswana has lost over 800,000+ hectares of Wildlife Management Areas (GH10, GH11, SO2, and KW6) partly due to the ongoing cycle of land degradation and encroachment into nearby areas. The central piece of legislation regulating designated land use on protected wildlife areas is the Wildlife Conservation and National Parks Act of 1992, § 3(15)(2) and enables the President to rezone and/or modify WMAs. Currently, most ranchers across Botswana operate an average ranch of 5 hectares with a few head of cattle and lack an understanding of carrying capacity resulting in overgrazing. The lack of enforcement mechanisms to prevent encroachment past communal grazing lands into WMAs coupled with Big-Agriculture interests converting rangeland into commercial cattle operations has resulted in the degradation of over 91,000 km² or 15.5% of Botswana. The KGP program was launched to provide an alternative to land conversion for landowners and game ranchers located in high-risk areas adjacent to WMAs and other wildlife corridors. By leveraging the voluntary carbon market the KGP protects both the biodiversity and sequestration potential of these critical areas. The main agents of conversion, private landowners, forego their legal right to convert native grasslands, and in doing so avoid GHG emissions totaling over 2.23M mt/CO2e over 10 years.","Ghanzi, Central, and Ngamiland Districts","Gazelle Ecosolutions

Family Forest Carbon Project,"Family forests make up over one-third of America’s 765 million acres of forestland, according to a 2021 Congressional report. This fact puts management decisions providing clean water, recreation, and other valuable resources in the hands of everyday American families. The importance of American forests to the global ecosystem and climate is central to the work of Forest Carbon Works, PBC, a US based company that seeks to conserve and restore family-owned tracts of forestland throughout the United States. Forest Carbon Works is acutely aware of vulnerabilities particular to family forest owners. Without an alternative form of income, families face pressures to liquidate their timber to cover unforeseen expenses. By the year 2030, Forest Carbon Works anticipates protecting 500,000 acres of land owned by many individuals with durable agreements of permanent carbon storage. The project longevity shall be at minimum 60 years with possible extension to 100. Extending rotation ages on these at-risk forests increases carbon storage relative to the baseline case, as well as increases biodiversity and diversity in forest structure. Estimated average GHG emission reductions from the project are 845,991 tons CO2 equivalent per year, with total reductions over the first 25-year project crediting period of 21,149,786 tCO2e.  This is a grouped project. The geographic area of the entire project shall encompass is the contiguous United States and southern Alaska.

China. The Project is invested, constructed and operated by Yongji Huaxinda Cleaning Energy Co., Ltd.. 
With two 300t/d MSW combustion production lines, the project will treat 600 tons of MSW per day. The combustion system is composed of two 300t/d mechanical grate incinerators, matched with one set of 12MW steam turbine generator. The project will process 250,000 tons of MSW every year, and consume 130.3 tons of 0# light diesel as auxiliary fuel. The MSW combustion line will work 8,000 hours every year, generating 72,748 MWh electricity, of which 59,972 MWh will be exported to the North China Power Grid (NCPG). The implementation of the project will meet the requirement of local MSW harmless treatment, and significantly improve local environment. Also helps reduce GHG emission that would occur in baseline scenarios such as power generating by fossil-fuel fired plants and MSW treatment at landfill.
By combusting MSW that would otherwise be disposed of at landfill, the project avoids the emissions of methane that would be generated under landfill condition. In the meanwhile, the proposed project can produce steam to generate power to replace the electricity that would otherwise be generated by fossil- fuel fired power plants which are connected to the NCPG. The baseline scenario of this project is the same as the scenario prior to the implementation of the project, namely the landfill gas is vented directly and the equivalent power is supplied by the NCPG.
It is estimated that during the 10-year fixed crediting period of the project (from 30 June 2021 to 29 June 2031), the average annual GHG emission reductions will be 63,176 tCO2e.",Shanxi Province,"Yongji Huaxinda Clean Energy Co., Ltd

Carbon Group Program for sustainable low carbon crop and grassland management in Argentina II,"The project intends to include producers dedicated to extensive agriculture (corn, soybeans, wheat, sunflower, cotton, and other crops), and extensive cattle ranching, mostly cattle and grazing grasslands, pastures, agropastoral, and silvo-pastoral. Given the characteristics of the country, farm and ranch  production dates from no more than 200 years ago.
During most of the 20th century, the farms were managed in a rather extensive manner and with aggressive tillage systems, which caused widespread declines in the organic matter content of the soils. This lasted until the end of that century, when for different reasons the producers adopted zero tillage systems, which are what predominate today (more than 90%).
The projects to be implemented are expected to mitigate climate change both by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and by capturing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and storing it as stable carbon in the soil, which must be recarbonized. The greatest efforts to reduce GHG emissions will be due to the adoption of better nitrogen fertilization technologies, which include alternative sources of nitrogen and variable rate fertilization that reduce nitrous oxide (N2) emissions from fertilized soils, the intensification of agricultural rotations with greater incorporation of winter crops, nitrogen fixing species and cover crops, and improved grazing management in livestock, which increase carbon stocks and with improvements in digestibility that reduce methane (CH4) emissions due to enteric fermentation. 
It is estimated that with these improvements, which are not currently widespread even among producers, it will be possible to reduce between 0.5 and 3 tons of CO2e/ha/year. Obviously, the total amount will depend on the area committed by the producers. This area is expected to reach more than 160 thousand hectares. If this is so, it is expected to mitigate almost 2 million tons CO2e at the end of this project.",Multiple sites,"Carbon Group Agro-Climatic Solutions LLC

CSA Carbon,"The C-SA Carbon Project focusses on this opportunity to restore subtropical thicket, sequester carbon and to deliver a broader range of social and ecological outcomes. The C-SA property includes a primary conservation area (in which the Kwandwe eco-tourism operation is located) as well as several severely degraded properties that have been acquired over time. The additional areas of at least 4,000 hectares were previously goat and ostrich farms and have been left in a degraded state, largely clear of vegetation and especially Portulacaria afra. The intention is to implement a landscape-scale rehabilitation project that includes the propagation and planting of Portulacaria afra as well as other species, combined with the long-term management of planted propagules and herbivory pressure. Such planting and management has led to the successful restoration of carbon stocks elsewhere in the biome. The outcome will extend beyond carbon sequestration to the delivery of further ecosystem services and a source of employment and income for local residents (in a region where such opportunities are rare). In an area that is predicted to become significantly warmer and drier over time, enhancing the resilient provision of water services to downstream communities and economies is of significant importance. Through direct restoration of over 4,000 hectares, the project is expected to sequester at least 1,078,000 tCO2e over a 40-year period or an average 26,950 tCO2e per year.",Eastern Cape,"C-SA Properties (Pty) Ltd

ARJUNA Project,"This project will promote tree-based wild silk production (sericulture) outside traditional forests by utilizing privately owned degraded lands that smallholder farmers currently do not significantly utilize for productive purposes. It will undertake host tree planting for the Tasar silkworm and silkworm rearing value chain development in two states in India: Jharkhand and West Bengal. Traditionally, the tribal communities in these areas depend significantly on forests for their livelihoods and have a long history of silk production from natural forests –silk is second to agriculture as a source of income/livelihoods. However, production from the forests have become uncertain due to government regulation of forest access rights and instability in the silk market. Yet there are large areas in these regions that are severely degraded, fallow, etc. that would benefit from restoring their productive capacity and biodiversity through profitable tree planting investments. Therefore, this project will undertake tree planting for Tasar production on an estimated 3,000 ha of such lands. 
The project is implemented by the Non-Governmental Organization (NGO): PRADAN - Professional Assistance for Development Action – which has a long-standing experience (50 years) in the area.

DR Congo Mangrove Blue Carbon Project,"The mangrove areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo (fall under the global category grouping of Central African mangrove eco-region. They are found within the Central Congo Province occupying an area of 23,684 hectares.Mangrove forests of DRC are crucial because of its importance in provision of goods and services which are unique to this type of forest such as shoreline protection and being a feeding and breeding ground of commercially important fisheries due to the location of these forests at the tidal estuaries ecosystems of River Congo as well as supporting a wide range of biodiversity. Despite these uses, the DRC Mangrove Forest has seen degradation and deforestation over the years. The threats facing these mangroves include the encroachment of the areas by the nearby communities leading to conversion of forest land to settlement and other land uses that is linked to population increase over the years, coupled with unsustainable harvesting for wood and firewood for varied purposes. Additionally, the loss of mangroves leads to the release o f the carbon stored by the ecosystem back into the atmosphere, thereby accelerating climate change. Through the implementation of the mangrove REDD+ project in the area the project proponents aim to conserve the mangrove areas by addressing the drivers of deforestation leading to a potential emission reduction of 689,274 tCO2e/year. Furthermore, the project proponent also aims to restore the already degraded and deforested area of 1161 ha during the project lifetime that will lead to additional emission reductions of 33,379 tCO2e/yr along with other benefits such as shoreline protection and biodiversity conservation. Thus, this REDD and RWE project is expected to avoid unplanned deforestation and degradation, along with restoration of the already degraded areas on an area of 23,684 ha equating to 21,691,891 tCO2e in emissions reductions over the 30 year project lifetime with an annual average of 723,063 tCO2e.",,"ClimeTrek Ltd

Reflorestamento de Impacto no Brasil Project,"Investancia Brasil Ltda  (Investancia) is undertaking a Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) grouped reforestation project, known as Reflorestamento de Impacto no Brasil Project. The Project is planting pongamia (Pongamia pinnata) and other tree species in degraded pastures across Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil in areas that were cleared of native forests more than ten years prior to the projects’ start date. 
Investancia is developing a business model to establish pongamia as a regional commodity in a region where agriculture, other than cattle-ranching, is extremely difficult to make work. The focus of Investancia’s business is four-fold:

1) Production of reforestation oil;
2) Maintaining cattle or hay on silvopastoral lands with improved pastures;
3) Providing protein (i.e., feed) for cattle from the pongamia seedcake; and
4) Sequestering carbon dioxide in the pongamia trees (i.e., generate carbon offset credits).

To date, Investancia has established a nursery, explored the suitability of pongamia in the region, developed protocols, assessed various genetic strains of pongamia, and spoken with numerous local landowners about leasing land. The Reflorestamento de Impacto no Brasil Project will sequester carbon dioxide and generate GHG emission removals in the planted pongamia trees and in the soil following the reforestation of degraded pasture.",Mato Grosso do Sul,Multiple Proponents,,Registration requested,239,,,Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use,ARR,AR-ACM0003,44 Hectares,,AENOR International S.A.U.,,"1st, 01/01/2023 - 31/12/2062",,,,,,4430

Land Life Reforestation and Restoration on Degraded Land in Australia,"The proposed ARR-VCS project is a large-scale grouped project centered on the reforestation of degraded lands in Australia. In the last 200 years, approximately 40% of Australia’s native forest cover has been lost due to human-induced land conversion. Today, much of the remaining native vegetation is highly fragmented. This grouped project aims for the long-term restoration of Australia’s forests, achieved through a mixture of direct seeding and seedling planting techniques to re-establish native flora and fauna, build ecological connectivity and reverse the deleterious impacts of land degradation. 

The project is managed by Land Life, a tech-driven reforestation company that plants trees at scale to restore degraded ecosystems globally in hubs like Europe, the US and Australia and maintains an on-the-ground presence in Australia, and collaborates closely with local partners and authorities. Local partner Cassinia Environmental brings on-the-ground expertise in forestry and conservation, supporting Land Life’s team of reforestation specialists in managing and implementing quality projects in Australia.

Santa Nicolasa North Patagonia Regenerative Grazing Project,"The “Santa Nicolasa North Patagonia Regenerative Grazing Project” aims to stop and reverse the historic soil degradation process of the region by implementing regenerative grazing technics by restoring the ecological condition of ~70.000 hectares of rangeland soils on Santa Nicolasa farm. Regenerative grazing activities can increase SOC concentrations, improve natural growing grasses, decrease bare soil, and improve water infiltration, among others. An average amount of 0,4% of Soil Organic Matter, is expected to increase, which results in a net GHG emissions reduction and removals of ~ 1,400,000 tCO2e in the SOC pool, with an annual average of 71,000 tCO2e in 20 years of the project. 
In general terms, the regenerative grazing activities restrict the cattle to relatively small paddocks to generate intensive grazing in short periods, followed by long grazing resting periods. As a result, a homogeneous disturbance on all the forage species is generated, avoiding the selectivity of the cattle for the most palatable plants. This technique requires the installation of new fencing and watering infrastructure and a significant adaptation of management practices. 
The project contributes to sustainable development by promoting an integrated management scheme with the ecosystem in privately owned land, avoiding carbon emissions and restoring native ecosystems from a degradation process together with the continuity of sustainable food production; promoting sustainable practices along the region, generating labor demand from the local population, and making improvements in infrastructure; generating knowledge on current SOC concentrations data and monitoring the effects of regenerative grazing management in the region; developing and improving a new mechanism to finance projects in the sustainable livestock production sector; the conservation of a unique ecosystem, that despite the severe degradation, still conserves the original land use and the natural ecosystem structure.",Río Negro,"Solmat Agropecuaria SA

Kijani Forestry smallholder farmer forestry project,"Kijani Forestry is a social enterprise founded in 2019, located in Uganda. Kijani’s mission is to empower smallholder farmers to generate income and combat climate change through the establishment of sustainable wood lots. As of 2022, Kijani has planted over 5 million trees with over 8,000 farmers throughout northern Uganda. Kijani works in partnership with local communities, government agencies, international non-governmental agencies, universities, and other stakeholders to implement sustainable land use practices and agroforestry management systems. Through these partnerships, Kijani aims to build capacity and establish a foundation for sustainable development in Uganda through growing trees that provide income-generating opportunities for farmers. 
Kijani works through a network of thousands of organized small groups across Uganda to establish small-scale nurseries, train farmers in nursery management, and mobilize farmers to establish fuelwood lots on their private land. Kijani’s unique approach addresses many of the barriers faced by rural farmers who wish to plant trees; Kijani provides all inputs needed for a productive tree nursery, including properly sourced seeds, potting bags, equipment for maintenance, and materials needed to care for seedlings. Kijani’s field staff are stationed in the communities full-time, and provide regular training to groups on nursery establishment and maintenance, seedling care, pest management, agroforestry practices, and fuelwood lot establishment and management. At any given moment, a Kijani staff member is no more than a bicycle ride away from a Kijani nursery.

"Working Trees supporting eastern US Silvopasture, Project 1","Working Trees grows trees where the interests of farmers and the climate overlap. 

The agricultural benefits of incorporating trees into active pastureland or hayland –, known as “silvopasture” or “alley cropping”,  respectively; collectively referred to as “silvopasture” –, include reduced livestock mortality, minimized heat stress, improved soil health, increased hay yield, improved water retention and infiltration. At the same time, planting trees on pastureland or hayland has been identified as the largest agricultural climate solution for carbon sequestration.

Despite these benefits, adoption has remained low due in part to high up-front costs and the multi-year delay between planting and benefits. Revenue from carbon credits presents an opportunity to overcome this imbalance. Financing from carbon markets affords farmers the opportunity to profit from sustainability enhancements and environmental services.

However, the methods used today for tree-based sequestration have mainly been accessible to large landowners. In the United States this means small landowners – who own 90% of farms and 50% of farmland – get left behind in the green economy. 

Working Trees innovative new approach to carbon-credit-supported silvopasture allows landowners of all sizes to start planting trees and reap the benefits of this practice through three key strategies: 
1. Streamlined eligibility and carbon measurement through a phone application
2. Guaranteed offtake of the generated carbon credits
3. Target geography spanning the Eastern US",TN,"Working Trees

Brazil Pastureland Regeneration with Native Palm Silvopasture,"This grouped project consists of planting Macaúba trees (Acrocomia aculeata) within agrosilvopastoral systems on non-forestland (primarily degraded pastureland) in the Vale do Paraíba region in São Paulo State, Brazil. 

Macaúba is a native palm tree that is drought and disease tolerant and uses 70% less water than the common commercial African palm, while still producing fruits that can be processed into commercial palm oil products (e.g. pulp and kernel oil, livestock fodder, biofuel, and fertilizer). 

The Vale do Paraíba region, located within the Atlantic Forest biome, is characterized by abundant biodiversity and endemism in its original form. However, due to extensive land-use changes that occurred over the centuries, it now exists in a fragmented state. Extensive low-productivity cattle grazing is currently the dominant land management regime in the project region. Cultivating Macaúba on those lands has the potential to slow soil erosion, store carbon in tree biomass, regulate the micro-climate, and promote biodiversity. The integration of Macaúba palm trees with cattle grazing and cropland will diversify and increase  income to local farming and ranching communities without displacing commercial or subsistence activities.  Whenever possible, the plantings will connect forest fragments to create ecological corridors that promote flux of genes through migration, dispersal, linkage and interrelation of populations of wild flora and fauna, all of which are important to biodiversity.

This project has the potential to remove on average 42,396 tCO2e annually throughout the project crediting period, with an estimated total of 847,925 tCO2e over the twenty-year crediting period in the form of aboveground and belowground tree biomass and soil organic carbon.",São Paulo,"Native, a Public Benefit Corporation

SOIL CARBON SEQUESTRATION BY ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF CLIMATE-SMART AGRICULTURE PRACTICES IN DIFFERENT CROP USE AND DEGRADED PASTURE RECUPERATION.,"The Carbon Program by AGROROBÓTICA aims the recovery of degraded pasture and crops by adopting and maintaining several climate-smart agriculture practices and considering the specificity of each Brazilian biome: Amazon Forest, Cerrado, Caating, Atlantic Forest, Pampa, and Pantanal. In advance, it is expected to increase the sustainability of this sector and raising the life standards in rural areas. The reductions and removal of GHG emissions expected to be achieved would not have taken place without it. As this is a grouped project, as defined by the VCS standard, it includes multiple growers with multiple enrolled fields. The estimate is that the project could promote a GHG emission reduction and removal of up 2,624,400 tCO2eq promoted by more than 2,000,000 ha, in the next 20 years. The carbon credit payments will provide an additional source of income to help farmers to implement sustainable practices and improve the livelihoods of their communities.
This project is an agricultural GHG emission reduction and removal project using the methodology “VM0042: Methodology for Improved Agricultural Land Management”, v. 2.0 and the AGLIBS ® Artificial Intelligence (AI) Platform, which is specifically addressed to fulfil the need for a high-integrity and cost-efficient monitoring system (MRV- measurable, reportable, and verifiable) through the emerging technology LIBS.  The overall objective will be achieved by supporting farmers to adopt and maintain climate-smart agricultural practices through agronomic support and the monitoring of soil carbon stock change inside the farm boundary. The primary goal is to promote a range of regenerative agricultural land management practice improvements targeted to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and reduce net emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from grower operations and degraded pasture area, increase farm resilience to extreme weather and climate change, and enhance yield, improve soil quality, and reduce GHG emissions.",Goiás,"Agrorobotica - Photonic in Agroenvironmental Certification SA

Argentina Gran Chaco Region REDD+ Project,"The Project aims to protect the native forest socio-ecosystems of the Argentine Gran Chaco ecoregion. The Grouped Project will seek to reduce planned deforestation and unplanned deforestation and degradation pressures by encouraging landowners granted with large-scale agricultural and livestock production deforestation permits to set aside their land for conservation and forest regeneration. It will also implement a combination of environmental and social activities aimed at improving the livelihoods of community members living in the vicinity of the project area as well as the enhancement of the forest and biodiversity.
In Argentina, deforestation has accelerated over the past 40 years as the country's agricultural frontier has expanded, resulting in one of the highest deforestation rates in the world. This expansion of the agricultural frontier is having a major impact on native ecosystems and their biodiversity. At the same time, deforestation and land enclosure have altered the livelihoods of many indigenous and/or peasant communities who use large areas of the Forest for their activities.
For the first Project Activity Instance the project proponent, VISTA Energy, purchased part of the El Chaguaral farm (4.892 hectares) in the current boundary of the agricultural frontier. The former owner of the property had a clearing permit to transform the land for agricultural and livestock purposes. VISTA will not make use of that permit. The activities to achieve this include fencing, hiring responsible field staff to monitor the property, and developing and implementing a biodiversity conservation plan together with an action plan for fire prevention, warning and response will be implemented. Also assisted natural regeneration and enrichment planting activities will be implemented.The initial activity instance is estimated to generate ≈ 983,460 tCO2e net GHG emissions reductions and removals (≈49,173. tCO2 e per year for 20 years)",,"Vista Energy Argentina SAU

Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture borders Hami City to the east, Shihezi City to the west, Turpan City and Bayingolin Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture to the south, Tacheng and Altay Prefecture to the north, and Mongolia to the northeast. The project aims to restore local degraded grassland ecosystems by rest grazing on degraded grasslands, increase carbon sequestration and contribute to local development by introducing sustainable grazing and managing grasslands.
Totally, 64,391.13 ha of degraded grassland have been managed scientifically by rest grazing. Rest grazing requires that adopting sustainable grassland management methods, such as rotational grazing in different pastoral areas, limits the time and number of grazing in the project
area to protect the natural grassland resources, curb the deterioration of the ecological environment of the natural grassland.
In general, rest grazing is implemented in slightly degraded areas (the total grass yield decreasedby 30%-50% compared with that before degradation). In addition to this main restoration measure, the project also alleviates soil desertification and restores grassland vegetation through grassland management measures to improve soil carbon storage and local biodiversity, supplemented by daily management measures of other protection projects, such as grassland fire prevention and rodent control, so as to ensure long-term sustainable management of the project area.

Community-Based Mangrove Conservation and Restoration in Sierra Leone,"In Sierra Leone, mangrove forests are under severe threat from the pressures of subsistence-based harvesting for construction material and fuelwood for cooking and smoking fish. The health of mangrove ecosystems is directly tied to the social and economic well-being of local communities that depend on them for sustaining their traditional livelihoods in fishing and shellfish harvesting. Communities further depend on the mangroves for preventing erosion, which threatens coastal villages. Through a community-based and livelihood driven approach, and in collaboration with the Government of Sierra Leone, this grouped project will generate greenhouse gas emission reductions and removals through avoided deforestation and reforestation of mangrove ecosystems in the Bonthe and Moyamba districts, identified as global hotspots for biodiversity and home to some of the most marginalized communities in Sierra Leone. The project will begin with the conservation of 10,624 ha of mangroves on Sherbro Island, expanding in subsequent instances to include conservation activities in a combined total of over 74,000 ha of mangrove forests.

MAHARASHTRA AND GUJARAT INITIATIVE FOR REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE AND INCOME CREATION,"Grow Indigo is implementing a project in Maharashtra and Gujarat to boost smallholder farmers' income through the adoption of regenerative agriculture, resulting in reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and positive environmental and economic outcomes.
The proposed project in Maharashtra and Gujarat addresses the GHG emissions caused by traditional agricultural practices in crops such as cotton, sugarcane, rice, wheat, maize, or soybean, without excluding other crops. Intensive agriculture practices in the project area have posed threats to land sustainability and contributed to increased GHG emissions.
The project aims to promote regenerative agricultural practices, such as optimized fertilizer management, cover cropping, zero- or reduced-tillage, improved water management/ irrigation, crop rotation, and agroforestry, to restore soil health, enhance biodiversity, and improve productivity.
The project takes an integrated and science-backed approach, including agricultural extension, outreach, agronomic support, digital data collection, and biogeochemical modeling.
The project will initially target 40,000 hectares in the project area and cover diverse cropping systems with regenerative agricultural practices that are known to reduce GHG emissions (N2O, CO2e, and SOC) and thus generate carbon credits.
The project also aims to link smallholder farmers to voluntary carbon markets, providing them with additional income opportunities and incentivizing the adoption of regenerative agriculture. With a cash incentive, smallholder farmers in the project boundary will adopt these practices more readily and contribute to sustainability and reduce GHG emissions.

REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE AND CARBON PROJECT IN SPAIN,"The project basically consists of the application of regenerative agriculture techniques and strategies on different farms in Spain, to promote a more sustainable agronomic management, and as a result increasing the amounts of atmospheric carbon fixed in the soil.
Regenerative agriculture promotes practices such as the reduction or absence of tilling the soil, the presence of plant covers, the non-use of synthetic chemical products, organic fertilization, the optimization of water use, the improvement of by-products or waste management, and crop rotation, among others.
The project is national scope and will be carried out on all those farms within the boundaries of the Spanish State that adopt the commitment to improve their agronomic management and that meet the established requirements.
Regenerative agricultural management is focused on improving the soil’s properties and promoting conservation practices. The implementation of these measures will help to improve the health and fertility of agricultural soils which translates into an increase in the amount of organic matter (OM) in those soils. Carbon is one of the main components of OM, so increasing its percentage in soils is equivalent to increasing the amount of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC).
Each of the regenerative strategies proposed in the project has a direct or indirect effect on the reduction of Green-house Gases (GHG), either by reducing emissions or by increasing its fixation in the soil.
Although it is gaining ground in recent years, regenerative agriculture is not a common practice in the Spanish territory. Most farms are managed according to the principles of conventional agriculture, in which the soil is considered a mere support which generally has very little organic life and therefore, the amounts of OM and C are well below the levels that they could potentially contain.

Symbiosis Continuous Cover Forest Project,"The Symbiosis Continuous Cover Forest Project is a reforestation project, proposed by Symbiosis Investimentos e Participações S.A., a company focused on the restoration of degraded land through the sustainable commercial reforestation of the Atlantic Rainforest native species.
The Atlantic Forest Biome (Mata Atlântica) is the most degraded in Brazil, with less than 12.4% left of its original area and very fragmented. The degradation started in the 16th century in the State of Bahia. Today, the same pattern of destruction is seen in the Amazon Biome, which started in the 70’s after the Atlantic Rainforest resources were depleted. In addition, plant breeding with the Atlantic Forest native species has not been implemented before.
The project is designed as a grouped project, with an initial instance at “Fazenda Novo Horizonte”, in Trancoso District of Porto Seguro municipality, Bahia State. It is situated in close proximity to Symbiosis headquarters, where seedlings are produced and where research and development activities take place. Novo Horizonte has a total area of 669.28 ha, from which 236.50 consist of the initial project area. Symbiosis expansion plans for the grouped project are focused on the South of Bahia, with projected 50,000 hectares of mixed species reforestation, in addition to 15,000 hectares of ecological restoration and 5,000 hectares of agroforestry with cocoa (also a relevant product of the region).
The land use in the region is predominantly focused on pasture, which is also the prior condition of all of the regions where the grouped project is intended to occur.
The project is designed for a 40-year crediting period, in which 27,499,184 tCO2e will be reduced/removed",Bahia,"SYMBIOSIS INVESTIMENTOS E PARTICIPACOES S.A.

Carbon Emission Reduction Project through Improved Water Management in Bio-farming,"According to information from the Ministry of the Environment of Japan, total GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in Japan in 2018 were about 32.3 million t-CO2eq. Of these, emissions from rice cultivation were the largest, at approximately 12 million t-CO2eq. , accounting for 38.2% of total emissions. The implementation of this project will reduce emissions by tCO2eq. per year and contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions from these agricultural activities.
At this project, we use VM0042 to reduce CH4 by using no pesticides, no fertilizers, and by drying the soil in the middle of the year. As for environmental impact, the absence of chemical fertilizers reduces most of the nitrous oxide generated from the soil and the carbon dioxide produced during the production and transportation of fertilizers, and the absence of animal-based fertilizers eliminates concerns about methane emissions from the fertilizer production process.",All,"AGBIOTECH Co., Ltd.

"FST SMALL-SCALE SOLAR POWER PLANT IN KAMPHAENG PHET, THAILAND","The FST solar project consists of the installation of solar photovoltaic power plants with a capacity of 9.98 MWp, located in Kamphaeng Phet Province, Thailand. 

Petroleum exploration and production required significant amounts of electricity use, baseline technology to produce electricity generate large amount of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions such as fossil-fuel power plant which use natural gas, diesel, and other fossil fuels used to generate electricity. The displacement of fossil fuel with solar power generation will generate GHGs emission reductions by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources such as solar power. The project involves the installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, which generate clean electricity without emitting GHGs emissions. In contrast, the use of fossil fuels for power generation produces significant GHGs emissions that contribute to climate change.  

Moreover, the excess solar energy generated will be stored in batteries, reducing the reliance on fossil fuel-based power generation. This will further reduce GHGs emissions associated with power generation. 

Overall, the replacement of fossil fuels with solar power generation projects will generate significant GHGs emissions reductions, contributing to fight against climate change.

"REDD Carbon and Biodiversity Project, Greater El Rey Area, Jujuy, Argentina","Tropical rain forests with their rich fauna and flora are threatened worldwide from deforestation and forest degradation. In Argentina, deforestation rates are particularly high, caused mainly by conversion of forests to expand soy and beef production. Wintershall Dea AG, VisionNetZero GmbH and Banco de Bosques have joined forces to develop REDD+ carbon projects to conserve large forest patches with a high biodiversity in the Northwestern region of Argentina. 
The project intends to protect and conserve 24,154 hectares that are part of the Yungas forests in northwest Argentina. The main project activity is taking the property off the market to prevent agricultural development and conserve its high carbon values, rich biodiversity, and critical ecosystem functionality by avoiding planned deforestation and forest degradation. Therefore, the project intends a joint certification with CCB Standard.
The project will deliver significant carbon as well as non-carbon benefits by conserving the natural forest ecosystems of the Yungas, one of the most biodiverse natural systems in Argentina and home to nearly 50% of the country's biodiversity. Through the income of carbon revenues, forest areas with high conservation value can be purchased and conserved by donating and integrating them into national or provincial protection systems.
The development of REDD+ carbon projects contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from forest loss and forest degradation. The number of generated credits is estimated based on the comparison of the projected baseline and the effectiveness of the project activities targeting the drivers of deforestation and degradation. In the project area that would be protected, the weighted average of tons of carbon dioxide per hectare (tCO2/ha) is 884 tCO2/ha. On that basis, up to 1.8 Mio. VCUs can be expected within the duration of the project (30 years).",,"VisionNetZero GmbH

"Kwango River Project, Democratic Republic of Congo","This afforestation project, set up in anthropogenic savannahs on the Batéké Plateau east of Kinshasa, aims to develop carbon sink plantations, i.e. plantations where wood is little or no harvested, in order to maximize greenhouse gas sequestration in the long term. The majority of the project's area will therefore be dedicated to forest plantations with this main objective. Another objective of these forest plantations will be the timber production: some trees will be cut down very selectively in order to maintain the constant volume of the forest stand over time, while sustainably a local timber sector, replacing informal logging of natural forests. We also know that another effective tool to combat deforestation is an alternative and renewable source of charcoal for urban use and agricultural products, based on the establishment of agroforestry plantations (trees rows will be intercropped with lines of food crops).
As a result, the Project will have several social and environmental benefits such as (1) CO2 sequestration on land that is currently non-forested and unused, (2) Less pressure on the surrounding natural forests, thanks to the production of charcoal and timber from sustainably managed plantations, and the sensitization of local populations to agroforestry, that is more sustainable and productive than slash-and-burn agriculture or (3) Job creation, increased incomes and local development in a territory heavily affected by unemployment.
In this project, we account for the removals of GHG that occurred through the creation of the plantations: we use the UNFCCC AR-ACM0003 CDM methodology and the VCS Guidance AFOLU Guidance: Example for Calculating the Long-Term Average Carbon Stock for ARR Projects with Harvesting (Version of the 8 March 2011).

Lishu Blackland Conservation Project in Jilin Province,"Heilongjiang Lishu Improved Agricultural Land Management Project (hereafter referred to as “the project”) is located in Lishu County, Jilin Province, China. The purpose of the project is to adopt improved agricultural land management practices including no tillage/reduced tillage，returning straw in fields and applying organic fertilizer, and to prevent the severe soil degradation caused by pre-existing conventional tillage in local crop land.
Since straw contains a large amount of organic matter and trace elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, returning straw to the field can effectively use organic fertilizer resources and increase soil organic matter (SOM). Straw returning to the field also can improve soil physical and chemical properties, enhance soil aggregate structure, and increase soil permeability. Applying organic fertilizer can reduce nitrous oxide emission compared to synthetic fertilizer.
The project plans to implement no tillage/reduced tillage practice, straw returning and organic fertilizer application in 15,385 ha of agricultural land in the first crediting period to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) and reduce nitrous oxide emission. The project proponent not only introduced more efficient and appropriate tillage method with Lishu County Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau to the farmers, but also provide technical training and support to the farmers.
The scenario existing prior to the project’s implementation is primarily conventional tillage without straw returning, which cause greater soil disturbance and increase the loss of SOM.
During the first crediting period from 20-Nov-2022 to 19-Nov-2042, the project is expected to generate GHG emission removals of 1,110,180 tCO2e, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 55,509 tCO2e.",Jilin Province,"Jilin Kangfu Environmental Energy Co., Ltd.

As indigenous forest species in New Zealand are notoriously slow growing, difficult, and expensive to establish on bare land, an exotic nurse crop of Pinus radiata is planted for both initial rapid sequestration and to provide cover to enhance the regeneration of indigenous undergrowth. Over time the indigenous forest species are managed to succeed the exotic species through the creation of light wells, pest and predator eradication, seed island planting and gradual selective thinning of exotics. This process made possible through the financing of VCU sales.

Under the baseline scenario, business as usual management practices are assumed with the typical regional practices of extensive livestock grazing, and in some cases abandonment of degraded scrubland of invasive species which is reflective of broader land management practices in New Zealand, without carbon financing. The project scenario is conservation management activities, wherein an exotic nurse crop is established initially to provide ecosystem protection and indigenous species enhancement activities.",,"New Zealand Forestry Removals Limited

Improved Grazing Management in Mosaic Forest - Grasslands Landscapes in the Centre-North of Argentina.,"The Improved Grazing management in Mosaic Forest-Grasslands Landscapes in the centre-north of Argentina aims to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by implementing regenerative grazing practices across different properties of the northern-central region of Argentina. The fundamental axis of this approach is the division of large pastures into smaller paddocks, implementing rotational grazing, which allows periods of rest and recovery for the land.
The grouped project area covers 1,212,583 km2 in the north-center of Argentina. The region is dominated by grasslands with varying degrees of tree or shrub cover, ranging from savanna ecosystems characterized by sparse tree density to mosaic landscapes of grasslands and patches of native forests. These types of ecosystems, which integrate trees, forages, and livestock, can create significant synergies that improve soil health, while sequestering significant amounts of carbon from the atmosphere.

Developing these regenerative grazing activities in areas with remnants of native trees or forests also plays and important role in the conservation of natural habitats. These productive systems mitigate climate change without the need for a change in land use, thereby safeguarding habitats that support a rich diversity of native flora and fauna. On this basis, the Project will in the future develop plans for biodiversity conservation and integration of the communities involved in each socio-ecosystem. In this way, conservation will be integrated into productive systems, encouraging landowners to change their paradigms about non-productive areas of ranches.

The first Project Activity Instance is being carried out in the “La Alicia” property, located in the province of Santa Fe. The values obtained for this PAI determined that the project activities can result in a net GHG emissions reduction and removals of ~ 231,829 tCO2e in the SOC pool, with an annual average of 11,590 tCO2e in 20 years of the project.",,"Vista Energy Argentina SAU

The project aims to reduce GHG emissions related to deforestation, over 200 000 ha in the department of Amazonas, Cajamarca and San Martin, in the north of Peru. The project will also contribute to consolidate an important conservation corridor and protect key ecosystems in the region.

Over the life of the project, we aim to diversify the income of more than 20 local organizations or communities. Currently, small and medium-scale conservation areas have little investment capacity and low or no income, a situation that can influence deforestation and forest degradation, thus generating loss or reduction of carbon stocks. CSN+ will make use of technical and financial tools available for conservation to generate greater benefits and create a diversified portfolio of activities, with the objective of creating a sustainable model for conservation.

CSN+ will enable the creation of a strong partnership between the communities, URAPI  and ECOTIERRA with the objective of reducing forest degradation and deforestation processes, introducing high productivity agricultural systems, ensuring the sustainable development of value chains; empowering producers, cooperatives, associations and the community in general; creating mechanisms for enforce conservation; and increase environmental awareness of the communities.","Cajamarca, Amazonas and San Martin regions",Multiple Proponents,,Under development,1246187,,,Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use,REDD,VM0015,200000 Hectares,,AENOR International S.A.U.,,"1st, 01/12/2021 - 30/11/2051",,,,,,4674

YBYRÁ REDD+ Project,"The YBYRÁ REDD+ Project is a unique REDD+ Project, composed by 74 rural private properties with a project area of 76,481.34 hectare of Amazon rainforest. The project is located in four municipalities: Paragominas, Ipixuna do Pará, Tomé-Açu and Ulianópolis, in the state of Pará, Brazil. The main goals are forest conservation and reduction of GHG emissions of 12,065,803.14 tCO2 in 30 years by avoiding deforestation of 38,317.74 ha in the Project area. 
Pará explores unsustainably the Amazon Forest since its historical occupation. In 2021, almost 25% deforested areas in Brazil were in Pará.  The document known as “Deforestation Arc” presented a list with 52 cities considered priority for prevention, monitoring, and control actions against deforestation  in the Amazonian region (decree nº 6.321/2007 and Ordinance n° 428 (2018) by the Ministry of Environment). The list includes Paragominas and Ulianópolis. 
The deforestation of the amazon forest in the region of the project is due to anthropic activities: timber exploration, pasture for cattle raising and agriculture. The pressure on turning forest into non-forested areas is consequence of the expansion of these economic activities, leading to invasions of private properties. For the project region, the main land use activity is the implementation of pasture for cattle raising. In relation to the social aspects, most of the communities are formed by rural farmers with social vulnerabilities, with presence of food insecurity, low income and lack of job opportunity.
Considering the aspects presented, the Project’s main goals, through conservation of forest areas and combating deforestation of the Amazon Forest, are: 1) To promote adaptations to climate change in the region; 2) To improve the quality of life of the population that lives close to the forest and 3) To conserve biodiversity and ecosystem services, through environmental education actions and foment initiatives to connect forest fragments of the PA.",Pará,Multiple Proponents,Multiple Proponents,Under validation,401491,401491,,Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use,REDD,VM0015,76481 Hectares,76481 Hectares,Ruby Canyon Engineering,,"1st, 31/01/2022 - 30/01/2052",Under validation and verification,Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation,Ruby Canyon Engineering,CCB Third Edition,,4681

Tasar Forest Carbon Project,"This Tasar Forest Carbon Project will promote tree-based wild silk production outside traditional forests by utilizing privately owned barren / fallow uplands of tribal farmers. The project will undertake wild silk (locally called Tasar) tree planting and promote sericulture-based livelihoods. Sericulture is a traditional livelihood, however lack of availability of host trees in natural forests constrains its expansion. Traditionally, the tribal communities in the targeted areas depend majorly on forests for their livelihoods and have a long history of wild silk production from natural forests – wild silk is second to agriculture as a source of livelihoods. However, production from the forests declined due to government regulation of forest access rights. Yet there are large areas in these regions that are severely degraded, fallow, etc. that would benefit from restoring their productive capacity and biodiversity through profitable tree planting investments. 
The project is implemented by Cognisphere Solutions Ltd. (CSL) with investment from Climate Partner Impact GmbH starting in 2022. The project will afforest 2,000 hectares of privately-owned wastelands with Tasar silk-host trees in the adjoining states of Jharkhand and West Bengal in India. The project implementation started from May 2022 and plantations were initiated in the season Jun to Oct 2022.
It will involve the participation of ~3,000 households in 125 villages, grouped into two clusters broadly in Jharkhand, and West Bengal. People in the project areas are majorly tribals with limited options to escape poverty and deprivation.

Livestock 2040/ Uruguay,"The Livestock 2040/Uruguay project is driven and conceived by the consulting firm Profesionales SRL.It involves the participation of farmers in Uruguay who practice rotational grazing and have implemented good management practices on their property. Project is a grouped project.Rotational grazing is the primary activity of the project, which brings benefits to the ecosystem: it prevents and reduces soil erosion, improves the nutrient cycle, increases soil organic carbon (SOC) levels, and boosts pasture production. Participants also implement good practices in grass-fed livestock management with the goal of enhancing the ecosystem's well-being through the management of the plant-soil-animal relationship. Grazing management that enables higher quantity and quality of pasture to support high stocking rates while respecting animal welfare is a key component. Activities that increase biodiversity, such as the inclusion of native species and hunting prohibition, are considered relevant.Additionally, actions are proposed to reduce the use of external inputs, such as fertilizers or livestock feed, which contributes to decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. The result of these practices is an increase in organic matter in the soil, i.e., higher SOC content. Furthermore, the process of grassland degradation is reversed.The baseline consists of soils that were previously used for agriculture or extensive livestock farming. These soils have lost productive plant species, with areas of bare soil, compaction, low fertility, and a high risk of erosion.The project scenario consists of structured soils with a good amount of organic matter, high fertility levels, and enhanced plant growth. Compaction, erosion risk, and the amount of bare soil decrease.Estimations of emission reductions and absorption were made for the first project activity instant located in Sierra de las Animas, Maldonado, Uruguay.

Land Life Reforestation and Restoration of Degraded Land in Spain - A,"The proposed ARR-VCS project is a large-scale grouped project that aims for the long-term restoration of Spain’s forests, achieved through native mixed-species reforestation that reverses the impact of land degradation and the loss of flora and fauna. Land regeneration and biodiversity rejuvenation are central objectives of this reforestation project, which employs the latest technologies and planting techniques that ensure the highest tree survival rate and support the permanent establishment of native forests that complement rural communities. The project proponent is Defined B.V., a private limited liability company based in the Netherlands. Defined B.V. is an investment vehicle that holds various climate impact investments all dedicated to reducing worldwide CO2 emissions. Project activities are implemented by Land Life, a Dutch technology-driven reforestation company that grows forests by planting trees at scale.

Project activities are implemented and monitored according to the VCS-approved project methodology AR-ACM0003, with the expectation that additional project instances are to be added over the coming years. The first group of instances of the project covers 186.3 ha of degraded land in Spain, at two planting sites: Pison (52.69 ha), located in the province of Palencia, and Mata de Hoz (69.22 ha), located in Cantabria, and Agallas, in Salamanca (64.39 ha). While each project instance is expected to sequester carbon across the entire 100-year crediting period, the ex-ante estimate focuses on the initial 40 years for practical reasons to determine the annual average profile. These project instances, implemented between 2020 and 2022, are expected to sequester approximately 55,4120 tCO2e over the initial 43 years of the 100-year crediting period. The estimated annual average of GHG emission removals is 1,385 tCO2e. A total of 144,561 native trees are expected to become established in the project areas.

The Resilient Tarangire Ecosystem Project,"The Resilient Tarangire Ecosystem Project (RTEP) builds upon the prior work of Northern Tanzania Rangelands Initiative (NTRI). NTRI is a collaborative effort between The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and several local partner organizations (Ujamaa Community Resource Team and Tanzania People and Wildlife) to work with pastoralist communities to conserve rangelands and improve rangeland management in the Tarangire ecosystem of Northern Tanzania. Increasing population has led to increased pressure on rangeland resources, resulting in an overall decline in rangeland health and loss of carbon stocks over the past several decades. Simultaneously, this increased pressure on rangeland resources has exacerbated human-wildlife conflict and conflict among communities.
The project will focus on increasing soil carbon stocks through improved rangeland management in participating communities. Through RTEP, communities establish seasonal grazing areas to ensure efficient use of forage in the wet and dry seasons. These areas are then subdivided into smaller grazing blocks in which high-intensity, short-duration grazing can be implemented, leading to an increase in soil organic carbon stocks by increasing annual net primary productivity and allowing for recovery of forage species that typically decline under continuous grazing. The project will also help train and support community grazing coordinators who are responsible for overseeing implementation of these grazing plans. The expected long-term average annual emissions removals on a per area basis 0.73 t CO2-eq ha-1. The expected project size is about 830,000 ha, meaning the expected average annual emissions removal for the entire project area is 607,360 t CO2-eq resulting in a total of 12,147,200 t CO2-eq over the project’s lifetime.","Monduli, Simanjiro, Longido; Arusha, Manyara","The Nature Conservancy

Panambi REDD+ Project: Forest Conservation in the Paraguayan Chaco,"Paraguay, renowned for its abundant fauna and vegetation, has emerged as an area of concern regarding deforestation in Latin America. Both legal and illegal practices are slowly depleting these natural resources. Beyond their role as host of a vast biodiversity, the forests are also a crucial carbon sink.
The conversion of forests into cattle ranching, agriculture and timber production is one of the main drivers of legal deforestation in the country. Despite the Oriental Region of Paraguay has a zero-deforestation policy, the Occident, known as the Chaco Region, lost around 4.37 million hectares of forest between 2005 and 2020 to these practices (INFONA, 2022).
Under these circumstances, this project has been designed to preserve the Paraguayan Chaco forests by grouping landowners that have plans and permits to clear land but are willing to reduce this planned deforestation. Our goals include raising awareness about conservation and its positive effects, controlling logging practices and monitoring environmental and social indicators.
According to VCS Standard 4.5, eligible REDD activities are those that reduce net GHG emissions by reducing deforestation and/or forest degradation and, since the land is legally authorized to be converted to a non-forest area, project activities fall under the Avoiding Planned Deforestation category.
In the long term, specific actions related to biodiversity and community will be defined to be developed within the project framework.
Under the selected methodology, the carbon project is expected to generate a total of 45 million tCO2e in emission reductions over the course of a 30-year period. In other words, a yearly emission reduction equivalent to 1,5 million tCO2e.",,"Ecosecurities Group Limited

Carbono Rural Paraguayan Chaco,"The Carbono Rural Paraguayan Chaco project aims to promote sustainable grazing practices in degraded pastures in Western Paraguay, targeting farmers practicing continuous or unsustainable grazing. The project aims to enhance grazing system productivity, soil carbon sequestration, and reduce GHG emissions. Paraguayan Chaco's primary economic activity is livestock farming, with farms ranging from 1,000 ha to 60,000 ha. Traditional management includes extensive pastures, resulting in degradation due to mismanagement, pests, weed proliferation, and overgrazing, mainly due to a lack of technical advice and high costs for sustainable practices. The project leverages carbon market incentives to promote sustainable farming.

Current practices lead to severe pasture and soil degradation, reducing land productivity and carbon retention capacity. The project seeks to restore soil properties, prevent degradation, and increase livestock productivity through controlled grazing, pest and water management, and producer capacity building. Desde el Suelo, an agronomic extensionist team, will implement and monitor project activities.

Increased grassland productivity is expected to sequester carbon, improve livestock production, and bring community and biodiversity benefits: i) enhance livestock production efficiency and stability, ii) improve soil quality, iii) raise livestock farming incomes, iv) enhance soil and grassland biodiversity, v) reduce pollution, vi) strengthen community resilience, vii) boost rural employment and skills in grazing management, viii) improve rural worker well-being, and ix) enhance animal welfare. The project aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals:

SDG Goal 2: Zero Hunger
SDG Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth

Pantanal REDD+ Program,"The Pantanal biome is located in the center-west of Brazil, covering portions of the states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. Considered the largest continuous freshwater wetland on the planet, this biome oscillates between terrestrial and aquatic phases, forming a mosaic of landscapes that provide great biodiversity of flora and fauna. Analyzing the historical context of the region where the Pantanal is located, there has been a considerable expansion of agricultural activities (the main local economic activity, mainly focused on the breeding of Pantanal cattle) and this factor, together with the high rates of forest fires in this area, results in a scenario of unsustainable exploitation of the natural resources of this biome.
Considering all the applicable legal requirements, landowners who have a surplus of native vegetation on their property and choose to preserve it, would fulfill the first requirement for obtaining economic incentives from the voluntary carbon market, through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) through Avoided Planned Deforestation (APD). Given all this context, the implementation of the REDD+ Carbon Program on a scale for the Pantanal biome is possible, providing a model of sustainable economic development that can help to redress the balance, reconciling the conservation of environmental services with traditional economic activities. Biofílica Ambipar, in partnership with rural landowners in the Pantanal of Mato Grosso do Sul who are committed to promoting dialogue that benefits both the environment and sustainable economic development, aims to develop economic activities linked to the conservation of environmental services and all their ecological functions through the implementation of the Pantanal REDD+ Program.",Mato Grosso do Sul,"Biofilica Ambipar Environmental Investments S.A

RESTORED PRODUCTIVE LANDSCAPES IN THE MAGDALENA RIVER MIDDLE BASIN IN COLOMBIA,"The main objectives of this project are: First, to recover lands degraded by land uses related to deforestation, such as cattle ranching; through ecological restoration, agroforestry systems and assisted natural regeneration, to ensure the recovery of forests inhabited by many species of flora and fauna, including endangered species such as the brown spider monkey, the blue-billed curassow, capuchin monkey, the white-faced curassow, and the night monkey. Second, by implementing restoration corridors to reconnect wild populations within a grassland matrix to increase the flow of individuals, and therefore the genetic flow, of these populations and thus increase their resilience and probability of survival in the medium and long term. And third, to recover strategic areas that are degraded, such as the banks of rivers and other bodies of water or areas where grassland productivity is low. 
FPP Colombia (project proponent) is a non-profit organization promoting biodiversity research and conservation focusing on endangered primate species. FPP initiated one of Colombia's first studies and conservation programs for the brown spider monkey.

TAJIMAT PUJUT - El buen vivir - Restauración y conservación de los bosques Awajún del Alto Mayo,"The “Tajimat Pujut, Restoration and Conservation of the Alto Mayo Awajun Forests” is a grouped project jointly developed by the Federacion Regional Indigena Awajun del Alto Mayo (Regional Awajun Indigenous Federation of Alto Mayo - FERIAAM) and Conservation International Foundation (CI). FERIAAM is an indigenous territorial organization that groups and represents 16 indigenous Awajun communities (13 in the department of San Martin, and 3 in the department of Loreto). FERIAAM is the lead project proponent and CI is the co-proponent. The project is located in the provinces of Moyobamba, Rioja and Datem del Marañon, and covers an area of 235,455ha.
The main goal of the “Tajimat Pujut” project is to achieve the restoration and conservation of Awajun forests. In recent decades, deforestation within the Awajun communities has accelerated, with greater impact since 1990 after the opening of the Fernando Belaunde Terry highway. The increase in deforestation is mainly due to a heavy migration of people from the Andes and coastal region of Peru to the Amazon, causing a significant change in forest cover due to the expansion of the agricultural frontier and the illegal logging of high-value timber species. The forests of native communities have been replaced by commercial crops, mainly by farmers (tenants), invaders and illegal loggers. 
The project will focus on implementing strategies and activities to achieve better management of the Awajun territory, strengthen its governance and indigenous identity, restore degraded areas, and diversify sources of income and sustainable productive activities that secure wellbeing for the Awajun people. Tajimat Pujut expects to generate 8,788,206 tCO2eq over the 30 year project lifetime, with an average of 292,940 tCO2eq per year.",San Martin/Moyobamba,Multiple Proponents,,Under development,292712,,,Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use,ARR; REDD,"VM0047,VM0048",235455 Hectares,,,,"1st, 01/01/2021 - 31/12/2050",,,,,,4749
WANAMEI (Árbol de vida) Conservando los bosques de Amarakaeri,"The “WANAMEI” Project is located in Peru, within the province of Manu (department of Madre de Dios), and the province of Paucartambo (department of Cusco). The Executor of the Administration Contract of the Amarakaeri Communal Reserve (ECA – Amarakaeri) is the lead project proponent and will work with Conservational International Foundation (CI) and the National Association of Administration Contract Executors of Communal Reserves from Peru (ANECAP) as co-proponents. The Project area includes the Amarakaeri Communal Reserve, its 10 associated indigenous communities and the Quero Haramba conservation concession, covering nearly 599,286 ha  

The Amarakaeri landscape is under high risk of deforestation as a result of the expansion of illegal gold mining into Madre de Dios. The main agents of deforestation are migrants, who come from neighboring regions in Peru due to the profitability of the mining activity. In addition, increasing migration to the region is driving an increase in deforestation through the conversion of forests to agriculture and cattle pastures.
The Project will reduce GHG emissions by implementing participatory conservation strategies with the indigenous communities’ partners of the ECA, and will be developed based on the RIA (Amazon Indigenous REDD+) guidelines established by indigenous national organizations as safeguards for carbon projects within their territories. These strategies include the strengthening of capacities for landscape monitoring and surveillance, developing sustainable economic activities, strengthening the organizations that lead the indigenous communities and ensuring financial sustainability of the initiative. The project expects to reduce 8.2 million tCO2 over the 30 year project lifetime with an average of 276,419tCO2 per year.",Madre de Dios/Manu,Multiple Proponents,,Under development,276418,,,Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use,REDD,VM0048,599286 Hectares,,,,"1st, 01/01/2021 - 31/12/2050",,,,,,4750
BULGARIAN SUSTAINABLE FARMING CARBON PROJECT,"The “Bulgarian Sustainable Farming Carbon Project” aims to raise farmers' awareness on the benefits of regenerative agriculture and how changes in agricultural practices can help in climate change mitigation and adaptation. 
Regenerative agriculture land management practices refer to farming and grazing practices that aim to reverse climate change by rebuilding soil organic matter, sequestering carbon, improving degraded soil biodiversity, improving water cycle, and restoring soil fertility. Regenerative agriculture does not imply only one practice, instead, it is generally a combination of techniques.
To achieve this objectives, different regenerative agricultural practices will be implemented. These will include, among others: 
-	Promoting no tillage or minimal tillage: this practice aims to avoid soils tillage which is one of the main causes of soil losses/erosion. This practice helps not only to conserve the soil structure but also to improve it and improve the soil organic carbon levels.
-	Introducing cover crops: this practice aims to avoid having soils without vegetation cover by introducing alternative crops in-between the main productive ones. This promotes soils conservation by avoiding erosion.  For this activity, Agrovar counts with a personalized information platform that processes the soils data which comes from laboratories and satellite information and as a result provides very specialized mixes of cover crops suggested for each land area according to every specific situation.
-	Information system for optimizing farming activities.
The project is developed as a grouped project within the boundaries of Bulgaria. The project activity intends to add more instances over the upcoming years. The project implementation will result in an increase of carbon stocks and a reduction of GHG emissions.",,Multiple Proponents,,Under development,242252,,,Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use,ALM,VM0042,8982 Hectares,,,,"1st, 01/01/2023 - 31/12/2062",,,,,,4751

REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE IN THE GANGA-BASIN FOR FARMER INCOME AND CLIMATE IMPACT,"Grow Indigo is implementing a regenerative agriculture-based carbon project that spans across Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. This project is taking a bold step towards environmental sustainability in the Ganga basin region of India. Common agricultural practice in these areas includes conventional methods such as heavy use of synthetic fertilizers, intensive tillage, crop residue burning, and excessive water consumption for irrigation. These practices have led to soil depletion and accelerated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, threatening the ecosystem of the Ganga basin. The transition to regenerative agriculture is vital to counteract soil degradation, fertility loss, water pollution, and natural resource depletion. This shift is crucial to maintain the ecosystem services of the Ganga basin. The potential impact of the VCS carbon project is immense. It promises to significantly reduce GHG emissions, improve soil health, and enhance biodiversity. Beyond environmental benefits, the project aims to uplift the livelihoods of smallholder farmers and enhance the resilience of the Ganga basin ecosystem in the face of climate change. Over a five-year period, the project aims to scale up to cover 4 million hectares within the Ganga basin region of the project area. The 20-year crediting period is expected to yield an average annual emission reduction and removal of 5,048,425 tCO2e.

SUSTAINABLE PERENNIAL ORCHARDS IN ISRAEL (SPOI),"Climate change mitigation in the agricultural sector falls into three approaches. First, by reducing the current carbon emissions, via a better management of the carbon fluxes. Secondly, by avoiding potential emissions (e.g., by reusing the crop residues). Lastly, by enhancing the removals of carbon from the atmosphere (Smith et al., 2008). Regenerative agriculture (RA) is a farming approach which includes several practices (e.g., use of cover crops, reduced tillage) aiming at sequestrating soil carbon and contributing to those three approaches. RA also aims at implementing practices increasing biodiversity (e.g., crop diversity), improving the water cycle (e.g., use of drip irrigation) and increasing resilience to climate change. 
In the present project, the three mentioned approaches are applied in the framework of the Sustainable perennial orchards in Israel (SPOI). The goal of this initiative is to reduce the carbon emissions currently emitted and to raise the carbon stored in the soil and in the biomass. In addition, the selected measures will contribute to improving crop yields and soil health. With perennials, year-round carbon removals will increase; the land will be irrigated with more precision which will increase the micro-organism activity. The leaves and the other biomass residue will remain on the ground from pruning, increasing the organic matter in the project areas. Orchards require less monitoring by tractors, thus reducing the demand of energy and the amount of fuel required, this reduces CO2 emissions in the project area, compared with the baseline scenario. Also, intercrops will be sown to increase the soil organic content. This is a grouped project, located in Israel. The main environmental and sustainable development objectives pursued by the grouped project are: a) reduce carbon emissions from less intensive agricultural practices, b) promote regeneration of soil and the increase of soil organic carbon (SOC), c) increase carbon sequestration.",,"Rivulis Pte.

Regenerative Agriculture and Forestry Technologies (RAFT) 1,"C-Quest Capital’s Regenerative Agriculture and Forestry Technologies project aims to reverse the trends of soil and land degradation by promoting project activities that sequester carbon in agricultural soils and biomass; reduce dependency on nitrogen fertilizers; increase soil organic matter, moisture retention and health; reduce erosion; and diversify crop production and agricultural income streams. Specifically, this project will support conservation agriculture (CA), intercropping of leguminous shrubs, alley cropping, and farmer managed natural regeneration (FMNR) of trees on farmland across Malawi. CA includes adopting minimum or no-till practices, retaining crop residues, and rotating or intercropping multiple crops. Intercropping practices will focus mainly on Tephrosia vogelii, an indigenous fast growing, deep rooted leguminous shrub that can be used as green manure and produces abundant firewood. For alley cropping, multi-use trees or shrubs are planted in rows between crop strips to promote soil fertility and stability as well as diversify farm products. Lastly, FMNR practices vary widely according to the preferences of individual farmers but in general involve the selective protection of trees regenerating naturally from existing rootstock or stumps on croplands. Together, these practices transfer carbon from the atmosphere to above and belowground biomass through photosynthesis, a portion of which is further transferred to the SOC pool through biomass residues and root exudates. Reduced soil disturbance from no-till further protects SOC stocks, increased soil fertility reduces fertilizer use and its associated emissions, and crop residue retention avoids emissions from biomass burning.",,"C-Quest Capital SG Africa Holdings Private Limited

"BAULU PROJECT, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO","Located in the center of the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the “Cuvette Centrale”, the Baulu Project is designed to protect 277,131 ha of native Congolese forests legally designated for selective logging. The Project is situated within Forest Concession 009/11 – Baulu, hereinafter referred to as the Baulu Concession. Since January 2018, this concession has been managed by the company Industrie Forestière du Congo (IFCO), which harvests volumes of commercial timber from it, following the terms of the Management Plan that was drawn up at the start of management. In 2023, as part of this project, IFCO has transferred the Baulu Concession to KNCC, with the objective of converting the logging concession into a protected forest.
The main activity of the Baulu Project is to set-aside areas of Logged-to-Protected Forests (LtPF), in the timber production series of 116,181 ha, to maintain and protect ecosystem services in forest production areas legally designated for selective logging. From the cessation of timber harvesting activities, which are present in the baseline scenario, the project aims to avoid emissions generated by logging, transport, processing of raw material as well as collateral damage to vegetation caused by the fall of cut trees on surrounding plants, decomposition of material left in the forest, construction of forest tracks for transport to the storage point and other infrastructure. A further advantage that the project will bring to the area is due to the cessation of the disturbance caused by logging activities to the fauna present in this area, which is very rich and varied, thanks also to the proximity of the Lomako-Yokokala Wildlife Reserve, which includes, among other species, bonobo, forest elephant, or Bongo antelope.

URSTAMM GROUPED PROJECT IFM SWITZERLAND & PILOT PROJECT KELLERAMT,"The Urstamm project is an Improved Forest Management (IFM) project in Switzerland. It is a grouped project. The scope of the project is set to be the entire Swiss forest territory since landowners from the whole country are invited to join the project. The registration period for landowners is organized in cohorts. The pilot project “Kelleramt” is based in the Central Plateau, or “Mittelland” of Switzerland near Zurich.

The project will apply selective logging to the parcels in accordance with the methodology VM0012 Improved Forest Management in temperate and boreal forests. The project will increase the carbon inventory by selective logging. The effectiveness and importance of this method has been confirmed by latest research and it will enable to build a climate anti-fragile or at least resilient forest population that becomes a carbon sink rather than a source.

The management plan is in accordance with the forest goals of the Swiss Confederation in terms of climate change mitigation and increased resilience of the forest to climate change. Indeed, it advises the forest managers to (i) increase biodiversity, (ii) increase structural diversity, (iii) increase genetic diversity, (iv) increase individual tree resistance to stress and (v) decrease the target Diameter at Breast Height (DBH). Selective logging allows the forest manager to actively control the development of the forest and therefore hinder the effect of climate change of the forest carbon sink. For example, this method allows the forest manager to increase light availability on the floor and promote light demanding and climate change resilient species. Also, the project is looking to increase the frequency of logging activities on each parcel in accordance with point (v) of the Swiss government and its forest strategy. 

To monitor the implementation of the sustainable forest management and provide precise information monitoring through remote sensing will be carried out (dMRV).",Aargau,"Urstamm AG

EKEN IFM SWEDEN NORTH #1,"EKEN IFM SWEDEN NORTH #1 is a grouped project located in Sweden under development using the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) methodology VM0045 – Methodology for Improved Forest Management using Dynamic Matched Baselines from National Forest Inventories. The project activities apply on conifer forests and include extension of rotation age (ERA) and commercial thinning on productive forests that are legally eligible for harvest.

In Sweden, most forest land is privately owned. Approximately 85% of the total forest area is classified as productive forest land and bound by the Swedish Forestry Act to be managed sustainably. The dominant forest management treatment in Sweden is clearcutting around the lowest legal harvesting age stipulated by the Swedish Forestry Agency. The lowest legal harvesting age is dependent on geographic location, dominant species and site productivity of a forest stand, and ranges from 45-100 years for coniferous species in the counties included in the project’s geographic area. From the clearcut biomass, typically only approximately 34% ends up as sawn wood products, while 66% feeds pulp and bioenergy supply chains.

By extending the rotation age by 15-30 years (with 40-year monitoring) on forests above the lowest legal harvesting age allowed by the Swedish Forestry Act and enforced by the Swedish Forest Agency, the project activities allow climate financing to close an economic gap for coniferous trees to grow to larger dimensions, improving the share of long-term carbon stored in sawn wood products, while also increasing volumes of standing forest carbon.

CAMERR Carbon Mangrove Ecosystem Restoration & Resilience,"The Carbon Mangrove Ecosystem Restoration & Resilience project (CAMERR) aims to enhance carbon sequestration by restoring a minimum of 2,000 hectares of degraded mangrove ecosystems in Cameroon estuary, also called Wouri estuary. The restoration efforts will take place around the Douala municipality. The project includes the plantation of mostly three species of native mangrove species: Rhizophora racemosa, Rhizophora mangle and Avicennia germinans.Currently, the mangroves in the Cameroon estuary are severely degraded, with deforestation rates estimated to be between 1% to 1.6% per annum. Human activities, such as cutting mangroves for artisanal methods of smoking fish, for cooking and for construction are the main drivers of deforestation. As such, it is estimated that the annual consumption of wood by households in communities bordering mangroves in the Douala-Edéa area is reaching 125.60 m3. Furthermore, invasive species such as Nypa fruticans and Pandanus candelabrum have invaded many mangrove areas, which severely compromises the natural regeneration of indigenous mangrove stands.The mangrove restoration project is developed by the French NGO Planète Urgence, in collaboration with local NGOs. The project activities involve the establishment and management of nurseries and the plantation of mangrove trees, or regeneration when it is possible. All sites will be geolocated using GPS services. These activities will involve the participation of local communities, especially in the propagule collection, nursery management, and planting, under the supervision of the project's technical implementation team. In addition, the project will also support the development of community forests managed by local communities and the creation of partnerships with local governments to ensure the long-term sustainable management of mangrove ecosystems.

Improved Agriculture Land Management in Argentina,"The Improved Agriculture Land Management Project in Argentina aims to support sustainable agricultural practices in the Central and Northern Region of Argentina. The Project will seek to implement practices that are currently not or only partially implemented in the country with low rates. 
Agricultural activities play a central role in the grouped project area. The current agricultural system is based on simplified farming practices. These include low crop rotation, monocultures and a high dependence on chemical inputs, which has led to soil degradation and nutrient depletion. The project will implement or intensify some of the following practices: (1) crop rotation, (2) rotations between agricultural and livestock practices, (3) cover crops, (4) implementation of regenerative livestock practices, (5) improvement of pasture management, (6) application of organic amendments, (7) improvement of water management or irrigation, and/ or (8) forest strips plantation. In addition, these activities will contribute to (1) minimize tillage and (2) minimize the introduction of crops that require soil disturbance in the harvesting process. These practices aim to increase soil organic matter, reduce soil erosion, promote the fixation and recycling of nutrients, prevent the spread of soil diseases, and maintain soil fertility in the long term, among other positive environmental effects. 
The first Project Activity Instance is being carried out in the province of Buenos Aires, comprising a total of 2,691 hectares. A very conservative estimate was made based on the projection of increasing the soil organic matter by 0.55% in 20 years. This is equivalent to an increase of 2.07 TCO2eq/ha-1year-1. Thus, the project activities can result in a net GHG emissions reduction and removals of ~ 108,608 tCO2e, with an annual average of 5,430 tCO2e in 20 years of the project.",,"Vista Energy Argentina SAU

ALA HONKO BLUE CARBON MADAGASCAR,"The ALA HONKO BLUE CARBON (AHBC) project, led by the Unima group, is a comprehensive initiative aimed at scaling up the restoration and rehabilitation of mangrove ecosystems along the northwestern coast of Madagascar. Covering three geographic areas, the project addresses environmental, biodiversity, and social impacts.
In the first project instance, 682 hectares of mangroves will be planted on Unima concessions, specifically on old fishponds and mudflats known as 'tannes'. These areas have remained barren for over 20 years, as confirmed by remote sensing analysis. The planting of mangrove trees in these areas is crucial for increasing carbon stocks in both biomass and soil.
This grouped project plans to expand to comparable areas within and beyond the current boundaries of the Unima concession. The selection of these areas will be done collaboratively with local communities and stakeholders. Bioengineering, land leveling, and canal digging methods will be employed to restore appropriate hydrologic conditions for planting the eight mangrove tree species naturally present in Madagascar.
The project aims to achieve social, economic, and environmental benefits. Local communities are actively involved through capacity building and participation in activities such as seed collection, nursery development, tree planting, and monitoring. Additionally, income-generating activities connected to the restored mangrove will be developed.
In terms of climate benefits, the first instance of the AHBC project is estimated to sequester 728,170 tCO2e over its lifetime of 40 years at an estimated average of 18,204 tCO2e annually. This reflects the project's commitment to mitigating climate change by removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere through mangrove plantation in specific intertidal zones.

The lack of employment, business opportunities, limited access to infrastructure and basic services contribute to local populations exploiting the forest for income generation. In response to these threats to the NCA, the 6 clans in partnership with Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund created NRP with the following objectives: 1) Mitigate climate change caused by deforestation and degradation and develop adaptation strategies for climate variability, 2) Improve the quality of life for local communities by introducing sustainable alternatives to forest exploitation, income-generating activities, and initiatives designed to address community needs, such as health, education, and safety, 3) Contribute to preserving biodiversity through community-led forest management, better land strategies, and forest monitoring, regulation, and surveillance.",North Kivu & Maniema provinces,"Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund

OGA REDD+ PROJECT,"The OGA REDD+ PROJECT aims to protect 8,348.78 hectares of Amazon rainforest located in Machadinho d’Oeste municipalitiy, Rondônia State, Brazil. The project promotes forest conservation and estimates to reduce 1,884,762.84 tCO2e (average of 62,825.43 tCO2e/year) in 30 years by Avoiding Unplanned Deforestation (AUD) and Avoiding Planned Deforestation (APD) in Lote 11 property.
AUD PAI scenario: The state of Rondônia has been expressive in the expansion of the Brazilian agricultural frontier, being agriculture and livestock the central axes of its economy. In 2023 the state saw a 450% increase in deforestation, being the third state with the highest deforestation contributions in the Legal Amazon. In Machadinho d’Oeste, this expansion led to increase in illegal deforestation, mainly for livestock, also resulting in the increase of social conflicts and illegal invasions. Furthermore, it is common for private properties in the region to exceed the conversion limit (or legal deforestation) allowed by the Forest Code. The main factors that lead producers to deforest their properties beyond the limit established in the Forest Code, according to various scientific studies, are (i) the opportunity cost of conserving the forest or native vegetation and (ii) the state's lack of supervision.
APD PAIs scenario: The project area is in compliance with the Forest Code, and the proponents will waive their right to legal suppression in order to protect the standing forest, thus avoiding an economically driven planned deforestation activity.
Given project approval, measures/technologies such as fire brigade training (internal and external community), reinforcement of terrestrial and remote monitoring, training courses will be carried out to qualify the project's employees and neighbours among other social activities will be implemented.",Rondônia,Multiple Proponents,Multiple Proponents,Under validation,49992,49992,,Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use,REDD,"VM0007,VM0015",8348 Hectares,8348 Hectares,EcoLance Private Limited,,"1st, 14/07/2021 - 13/07/2051",Under validation and verification,Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation,EcoLance Private Limited,CCB Third Edition,26-May-2024 to 01-Jun-2024,4865

The project area is located in the municipality of Pauini, in the southern region of the state of Amazonas. The municipality is among the 100 poorest in Brazil. 
The owners of Jataí farm, analyzing the possibilities of using the area of the property economically in a sustainable way and based on Brazilian environmental legislation, which allows the use of up to 20% of the total property , requested permission to suppress vegetation for cattle ranching. For this, the landowners hired a consultancy to prepare a Business Plan detailing the viability of cattle raising in the permitted area, concluding that the activity was feasible.
Having carried out a more detailed analysis in search of a genuinely sustainable economic activity that would avoid the removal of the forest, even legally, and the consequent loss of the biodiversity present in the region, the possibility of developing a conservation project in the area was considered.

Tatuy REDD+ Project,"The Tatuy REDD+ project aims to avoid unplanned deforestation in an area of 22,724 hectares of Amazon Forest in one of the areas with the highest deforestation pressure for the expansion of agricultural activities in Brazil. The project is located in the state of Mato Grosso, within the municipal boundaries of Porto dos Gaúchos and Tabaporã.
The main project activities that generate GHG emission reductions are actions to increase fire monitoring and fighting to prevent the loss of forest cover, as this is one of the first steps of deforestation and land use change in the region. Surveillance and environmental awareness activities with communities contribute to the achievement of the expected climate benefits.
Prior to project implementation, the scenario was insecure for forest integrity in the project area due to high pressure from fires, illegal deforestation, and agricultural expansion. 
The project communities had limited organization and commitment to address local social weaknesses, such as few income-generating opportunities for women, poor community welfare conditions, among others. 
Local wildlife suffers from changes in land use with the loss of forest cover, species seek food, refuge and other elements for their survival in other areas, which become increasingly distant. This increases the risks associated with roads, such as being run over.
The main climate, community and biodiversity objectives of the project are to:
- Avoidance and prevention of unplanned deforestation of the tropical rainforest in the region, thereby avoiding the emission of  1,220,922 tCO2e over a period of 30 years of the project crediting period (annual average of  40,697  tCO2e);
- Protection and conservation of 22,724 ha of forest in the Amazon biome;

Landscape-based approach towards the revitalization of degraded agro-ecology for livelihood generation of marginalized communities,"The proposed VCS project “Landscape-based approach towards the revitalization of degraded agro-ecology for livelihood generation of marginalized communities”, represents an afforestation project in the states of Odisha and Maharashtra, India. The project promotes and implements the plantation of Eucalyptus species with short rotations in privately owned lands of small and marginal farmers in the project area. 
Maharashtra (63.7% ) and Odisha (20.61% ) are among the largest contributors to the agricultural sector of the country, and are majorly dependent on rain-fed agriculture (around 75% - 80%  ) for sustenance making them vulnerable to the changing climatic conditions. Rise in temperature, unpredictable rainfall, soil erosion and increasing drought are among the major conditions that are affecting the productivity of the land leading to crop failure  . 
Urvara Krsi Private Limited (UKPL) has been promoting agroforestry with small & marginal farmers belonging to various tribal communities across the states of India. UKPL with its landscape approach is implementing plantations under models such as Block plantation, Wadi Model (NABARD), Bund Plantation etc. in agricultural areas, bunds, wasteland, community land, and barren land. They provides expert technical guidance to the farmers on the selection and maintenance of plantations and assists in creating market linkage for the sale of timber/pulp. This model not only helps in increasing the productivity of the land but also creates additional livelihood opportunities for the farmers.
The project area is estimated to carry out plantation on 13,255 ha of land between 2021 to 2024. Over a crediting period of 29 years the project will generate gross removals or net removals of 12,63,577 tCO2e and 43,571 tCO2e/yr.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4893

Fortaleza Ituxi III ALM,"The Fortaleza Ituxi III ALM project is located in one of the regions with the highest deforestation rate in the Amazon Biome: the municipality of Lábrea. For the last 10 years,
it has been one of the most deforested municipalities in the Amazon Biome and the south of Lábrea has already been reached by the “Arc of Deforestation”. Beside the
damage caused to natural ecosystems, the land-use changes have provoked severe social conflicts through processes of land-grabbing and installation of agriculture and
cattle ranching activities (often irregular or even illegal), contributing to the expulsion of family-scale forest extractives from that region. The main activity of the Fortaleza Ituxi III ALM project consists of growing Açaí (Euterpe oleracea) in an integrated production system intercropped with pasture for a low carbon cattle grazing. The project area is located in the municipality of Lábrea, in the state of Amazonas, in northern Brazil. The project area covers an extension of 371.52 ha, referring to the lease of the first instance and lies to the north of the Ituxi River, situated on the Nossa Senhora das Cachoeiras do Ituxi farm.

REDD Pantanal,"REDD Pantanal is a multi-activity grouped project located in the Pantanal of Brazil. The project is classified under scope 14 - AFOLU and falls into the category of REDD considering planned and unplanned deforestation. Its main goal is to conserve the remaining forest cover of properties under pressure from deforestation and forest degradation, reducing GHG emissions.
Mapbiomas’ Annual Deforestation Report of Brazil indicates that Pantanal deforestation has increased by 8.2% from 2021 to 2022. The 2022 deforestation rate was 31,212 ha. The increase in deforestation in natural forests of Brazil, threatens climate change mitigation and affects provisions of energy, water, and food security in Brazil and worldwide. 
REDD Pantanal seeks landowners who opt to keep conserved areas which could be converted legally. Additionally, it will strengthen the protection of Permanent Preservation Areas (APP) and Legal Reserves (RL), which have also been targeted by illegal deforestation and degradation. ECCON will be responsible for the development, implementation across different instances, and monitoring of the climatic parameters of REDD Pantanal. Landowners are also involved in the project, who, through the signing of a contract contribute effectively to maintaining their areas under native vegetation. This commitment allows them to support the activities to be developed by the project. 
The revenue from carbon credits generated by REDD Pantanal will contribute to conservation, making the activity more appealing for the rural producers. Therefore, maintaining the standing forest will be a competitive alternative to other land uses, which poses a threat to the conversion of native vegetation in the current scenario.
REDD Pantanal activities commenced in 2021, with a 45-year crediting period, from November 18, 2021, to November 17, 2066. PAI 01 is the first instance of the project, which will prevent the emission of 1,837,304 tCO2e over 30 years.",Pantanal Biome (MS),"ECCON Solucoes Ambientais

With the ARBRE grouped project, CTaT is strategically positioning itself and its partners, at the dynamic intersection between climate change mitigation, climate change adaption and efforts to render industrial agriculture more regenerative in the Province of Quebec. The main ARBRE project activity is to convert nonproductive degraded non-forest old fields / abandoned former agricultural fields to sugar maple producing orchards in a shelterwood arrangement that will mimic natural succession ecological processes. Some low value productive agricultural land will be afforested  The baseline scenario is the old fields staying as degraded non forest and unproductive land, with a thick herbaceous layer and/or shrub mat impeding natural tree regeneration and/or continued agricultural production of low value agricultural land.  CTaT has selected old-fields sites where the above mentioned pre-existing conditions will cause a long regeneration delay, with only marginal shrub and/or tree ingress over the crediting period.   CTaT is planning a first annual instance/pilot project of 125 hectares to be established in 2024 as part of an overall buildout of 1000 hectares from 2024 to 2029.  Total net project minus baseline sequestration over for all 5 annual instances is estimated to be approximately 500,000 tCO2e.  The ARBRE project offers multiple non carbon benefits such as enhanced wildlife corridor habitat and slope stability as well as diversified regenerative agriculture values to farmers.

Grouped Improved Agricultural Land Management Project in Jilin Province,"Grouped Improved Agricultural Land Management Project in Jilin Province hereinafter referred to as “the Grouped P roject”) implements conservation agriculture (crop residue addition and reduced tillage in monocrop ping corn fields located in Jilin Province, China. The first seven instances initially included in the project design cover 572,600 hectares ( 8,589,000 MuMu1) of monocropping corn fields located in Da’an City , Gongzhuling City, Jiutai District, Nong’an County, Shuangyang District, Taobei District, Tongyu County, all of which are county level administrative divisions in Jilin Province Inclusion of new instances is possible on the condition that the new instance meets the eligibility criteria set out in Section 1.5.1.  Fujian Huanrong Environmental Protection Co., Ltd. is the project proponent.
The Grouped P roject is expected to replace conventional farming practices and promote conservation agriculture , which entails incorporating crop 
 residues in the fields after the harvest and applying reduced tillage prior to sowing. Reduced tillage minimizes soil disturbance , and crop residues incorporated in the fields contribute to soil organic matter increase and avoid greenhouse gas emissions which would otherwise occur due to burning or other management measures.
The scenario existing before the project initiation is conventional tillage without crop residue addition. The baseline scenario is the same as the conditions existing prior to the project initiation. During the first crediting period which spans for 10 years, the Grouped Project is expected to generate total GHG emission reductions and removals of 10,497,660 tCO 2 e, with annual average GHG emission reductions and removals of 1,049,766 tCO 2 e.",Jilin,"Fujian Huanrong Environmental Protection Co., Ltd

COMACO South Landscape Management Project,"This project description document covers COMACO operations in part of the Central province (Mumbwa and Shibuyunji districts) and part of Southern province (Itezhi-Tezhi district) of Zambia. The COMACO South Landscape Management Project (CLMP-South) promotes sustainable agriculture land management and improved forest management. The key objectives of the project are to improve agricultural soil management through climate smart agricultural practices and reduce uncontrolled forest loss and degradation through community base conservation and land use planning. Hence, the project comprises two components:
1. Sustainable Agricultural Land Management (SALM) component – which aims to promote widespread adoption of agricultural practices including conservation agriculture and agroforest that increases the food production per unit area. The project promotes the adoption by farmers of legume-based alley cropping, residues management (e.g. mulching; cessation of residue burning), use of organic fertilizers such as composite and animal manure, reduced tillage and the intercropping of Gliricidia Sepium as part of Agroforestry to restore soil quality and sequestrate carbon.
2. REDD+ (Avoided Unplanned Deforestation) component – which aims to reduce forest loss, protect and expand areas under natural forest, and conserve biodiversity. This is achieved primarily through land use planning and creation of Community Conservation Areas (CCAs) for protection of natural forest, coupled with sustainable non-extractive forest use, e.g. honey and mushrooms. The creation of CCAs and the enforcement of by-laws to protect them promotes the protection of ecosystems and biodiversity within and around the CCAs.
The annual average GHG emission reductions of the project are estimated at 224,504 tCO2-e, and total GHG emission reductions over 20 years are estimated at 4,490,084tCO2-e.

SPEKBOOM RESTORATION PROJECT BEKA EMVA IGWANISHE - ISIXHOSA,"In the Eastern and Western Cape Provinces of South Africa, livestock overgrazing has played a significant role in desertification within the Subtropical Thicket Biome (STB), also known as the Albany Thicket Biome. Approximately 90% of the biome has experienced moderate to severe degradation as a result. This degradation has had detrimental impacts on critical ecosystem functions, including reduced availability of forage, increased soil erosion and runoff, decreased soil fertility and productivity, compromised water retention capacity, and loss of habitats. Consequently, farmers and agricultural workers have been experiencing declines in their livelihoods as the land can support progressively fewer animals.
The main objective of the project is to restore the functionality of 100,000 ha of degraded areas within the STB by reintroducing spekboom (Portulacaria afra), a pivotal species recognized for its effectiveness in thicket restoration. across the municipalities of the Eastern and Western Cape Provinces of South Africa, covering regions where the STB naturally occurs.

"EARTH MAA LLC- BAMBOO, CASHEWNUT AND MANGO PLANTATIONS FOR FARMERS ECONOMIC UPGRADE","The Afforestation, Reforestation, and Revegetation (ARR) project is an ambitious initiative aimed at combating climate change, restoring biodiversity, and supporting sustainable development through largescale tree planting and ecosystem restoration efforts. The aim of the project is to address global climate change through promoting native forestry trees, specifically, bamboo, cashew nut and mango plantations in the project area. Bamboo, Cashew nut and Mango have a natural capacity to absorb CO2. The Bamboo has growth from 1.0 to1.2 meters per day and gain mature status within 2.5 to 3 years. All three plants; i.e. Bamboo, Cashew nut and Mango help in preventing soil erosion and restoring degraded areas caused by deforestation or natural disasters which serve various environmental benefits and have the potential impact to the fight against climate change.

The project activity has the following objectives: 

1. The activity encourages plantation of bamboo, cashew nut and mango trees as all these three contribute to carbon sequestration by absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere
during the process of photosynthesis. This not only helps mitigate the effects of climate change but also improves air quality. Mature Bamboo, Mango and Cashew trees are particularly effective
in this regard, storing significant amounts of carbon in their biomass over their lifespan, which can extend up to 50 years or more.

2. By engaging local communities, such as landowners and their families especially tribal women in plantation, this project not only helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also provides a
sustainable source of income and livelihood for farmer communities. 

3. The project provides a sustainable source of timber through bamboo, cashew nut and mango. Bamboo a type of grass has the special ability to keep absorbing carbon even after selective
harvesting. This=means that carbon sequestration continues, making it an effective and long lasting solution.",Maharashtra,"EARTH MAA LLC

Heilongjiang Zhaoyuan Improved Agricultural Land Management Project,"Heilongjiang Zhaoyuan Improved Agricultural Land Management Project (hereinafter referred to as “the project”) is located in Zhaoyuan County, Daqing City, Heilongjiang Province, China. The purpose of the project is to adopt improved agricultural land management practices to prevent the severe soil degradation caused by pre-existing conventional tillage in local crop land.
The improved agricultural land management practices of the project focus on no-tillage on fields evenly mulched with crushed straw for two or three years, followed by plowing or subsoiling once and continued no-tillage for another two or three years. No-tillage can effectively reduce the loosening of the surface soil layer and soil disturbance, reduce the loss of water and nutrients in the soil, ensure the retention of organic matter in the soil, reduce the degree of compaction of the tillage equipment on the tillage soil layer, and preserve appropriate space for the growth of crops, which is convenient for ventilation and keeps the soil with good water storage capacity. The application of no-tillage sowing has solved the problem of sand blowing in bare farmland to a certain extent and played a role in windbreak and sand fixation. No-tillage can maximize the protective effect of straw mulching on soil.  
The project plans to implement improved agricultural land management practices in 87,479 ha corn field in the first crediting period to increase soil organic carbon (SOC).

SEIKOPAI REDD+,"The SEIKOPAI REDD+ project aims to reduce and prevent GHG emissions from deforestation activities in the territory of the Native Community located in the basin and right bank of the Napo River, at Santa Maria stream, through the development and implementation of a REDD+ strategy built collectively and in a participatory manner with the members of the community and also aligned with the objectives of the life plan, which is conceived as a communal planning instrument that contains the worldview, history and vision of the community. It also takes into account the territorial planning and environmental protection instruments of the region to articulate the REDD+ strategy. 

This project corresponds to the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector, in the category of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). The project area is within the community territory and covers 134.228 ha of amazon humid forest. It is expected to avoid the emission of 8.780.025 tCO2 for 40 years, which corresponds to 219.500 tCO2/year. Aboveground Biomass (BA of trees and non-trees), Belowground Biomass (BS) and Soil Organic Carbon (COS) pools are taken into account in the project's carbon accounting, considering them to estimate the baseline scenario and monitor performance during project implementation.

During the last years, this amazon area has been under threat due to logging, agricultural expansion and fauna exploitation. Mining is also increasing in surrounding areas, thus representing a huge threat to the ecosystem’s conservation. The project aims to tackle forest pressures and contribute to mitigate climate change by reducing CO2 emissions derived from deforestation, restore degraded lands, promote sustainable management of forests and develop productive activities to improve community welfare. The project seeks to protect biodiversity and high conservation values, maintain ecological connectivity and secure natural habitats for vulnerable and threatened species along with other biodiversity of cultural and spiritual importance for the communities.  

The climate, community and biodiversity objectives are detailed next:

The climate objective is to mitigate climate change through measures that reduce and prevent deforestation and forest degradation activities. The expected results include decrease in illegal logging, recovery of degraded forests, reduction of forest conversion to other land uses and maintained forest carbon stocks over time.

The community objectives were defined with the members of the Vencedor community and aim to improve their living conditions in the territory and include: i) strengthening governance; ii) development of sustainable productive activities compatible with biodiversity conservation; iii) increase social investment; iv) improve monitoring and biodiversity protection initiatives.

Regarding biodiversity conservation, the project seeks to protect amazon tropical forest and its diversity, contribute to maintain the functional connectivity of this forest areas, improve knowledge and management capacities of productive systems that favour biodiversity, as compared to baseline scenario conditions.

In this way the REDD+ project generates a positive impact since it contributes to improve living conditions of the native communities and protects biodiversity to secure the provision of ecosystem services and ecological structure in the long term.",Putumayo Province,Multiple Proponents,Multiple Proponents,Under validation,219500,219500,,Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use,REDD,VM0007,134214 Hectares,134214 Hectares,Colombian Institute for Technical Standards and Certification (ICONTEC),,"1st, 16/06/2021 - 15/06/2061",Under validation,Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation,Colombian Institute for Technical Standards and Certification (ICONTEC),CCB Third Edition,,5077
Tond Tenga,"Tree Aid (TA) is an international development non-governmental organisation (INGO) that focuses on working with people in the Sahel region of Africa to tackle poverty and the effects of climate change by growing trees, improving people's incomes, and restoring and protecting land. It is a registered charity in the UK. TA is partnering with Earthshot Labs PBC (Earthshot) and Capricorn Investment Group LLC (Capricorn) to restore degraded landscapes in Burkina Faso through enrichment planting and agroforestry activities.
TA has partnered with local communities to identify 37 sites of degraded woodland and shrublands located in 18 communes and 4 regions with the potential to become new forest sites through enrichment planting. These sites have been affected by deforestation and decades of unsustainable agricultural activity, leading to soil degradation that has prevented further agricultural activity. This has resulted in desertification and the loss of access to culturally relevant non-timber forest products (NTFPs) that are extremely significant in socio-economic terms. Thus, the project identified activities in enrichment planting and agroforestry to restore native forests and increase access to NFTPs. 
Through enrichment planting, the project will restore native tree species with high importance to the biodiversity of the area, high restoration potential and some NTFP uses. In total 12,000 ha will be targeted across these 37 forest sites. In total just over 142,500 trees will be targeted on farmland in and around the 37 forest sites.

Selva Paranaense Vida Nativa - GS1,"Located in the extreme east of the province of Misiones, in San Pedro, the field of native forest where the project is located has 22,878.5 hectares and immersed in the Green Corridor. In this area, controlled logging has been carried out since the 1960s and will decrease as the NIDEPORT project progresses, with harvesting expected to be completed by the end of 2021. The project activity is improved forest management with areas that will be enriched and regenerated by planting more than 250,000 native species individuals annually and others managed to increase forest productivity (bambuacea´s control, and others). 
Although there is not any community, individual or group of people living in the project area, GS1 has been subjected to situations of intrusions and illegal occupations, with burning for planting or deforestation for rudimentary construction, there are numerous cases where the land has been colonized or exploited for agriculture or livestock, where the land is left with high levels of degradation and contamination. 
The project zone, encompassed in an area with population under poverty line, expects to work together with the community identifying risks, HCV areas and needs, in order to implement mitigation actions together. In this line, first meetings with communities have already helped to identify both biodiversity and community´s HCVs, and possible projects regarding housing improvement, health care, among other needs to be identified during the project lifetime.
The climate benefits of the project are defined as the reductions or removals of GHG emissions resulting from forest regeneration, these are expected to reach 3,106,582 tCO2e during the crediting period, averaging 103,553 tCO2e per year.",Misiones,"NIDEPORT SOCIEDAD ANONIMA

Cultivating Carbon Regenerative Agriculture Project,"The aim of the project is to facilitate the roll-out of conservation agriculture in regions of South Africa where it is not prevalent. The intention is to at a minimum, assist farmers to replace conventional cultivation practices with the three essential components of CA – no till, cultivating a variety of species and the maintenance of organic cover through the year. 

To facilitate the initial adoption as well as long-term maintenance of these essential components and potential additional activities, a broad set of activities are required that are centred around three themes or goals:
1. To address the lack of regionally specific awareness, knowledge, evidence and models. 
2. To build regional technical support programmes and peer networks based on trust and evidence, and
3. To create an attractive financial incentive package to sustain implementation over the long-term. 

In terms of a broad strategy, a bottom-up participatory approach will be followed working with existing programmes, farmer study groups, farming organisations and institutions to increase awareness and knowledge of the opportunity in an effective and efficient manner. In a similar manner, regional expertise and research will be drawn upon to develop the supporting science, monitoring methods and financial models. Such an approach not only improves the viability of the underlying activities, but creates the trust required to sustain implementation over the full project period.  

This approach is based on the proven concept of farmer innovation platforms where the engagements and interaction are farmer centred.  Farmers are seen as the principal restoration agents and practitioners.  

A grouped project approach will be taken where the intention is to add project instances over time that meet all eligibility criteria. The initial set of identified farms are expected to lead to GHG emission reduction and removals of approximately 106,000 tCO2e per year or 3,180.000 tCO2e over a 30 year project.",South Africa,"Cultivating Carbon Proprietary Limited

Soil+ Project to Incentivize Emissions Reductions and Removals on Agricultural Land in Europe,"The aim of the climate protection project is to increase soil organic matter content in arable soils and simultaneously reduce agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions via a broad scale-up of regenerative agriculture. Therefore the project intends to motivate as many farmers as possible to convert from conventional farming, the most common type in Germany, to regenerative agriculture practices. This is done through financial support and in-depth knowledge transfer using digital platforms (company-owned web application & mobile application). 
Today, conventional agriculture is the predominant agricultural practice in Germany, with dramatic consequences for the overall soil fertility and the soil carbon stocks. Therefore, one focus of the project is to reduce CO2 by increasing the SOC stock. But at the same time the project considers the reduction of CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from agricultural management activities, such as fossil fuel consumption, fertiliser use or livestock production. This enables a holistic view on the development of GHG-emissions related to regenerative management methods. Other positive side-effects of large scale project application can be taken into account, such as an overall improvement of the soil fertility and health  including i) an increase in water storage capacity, thus providing a higher drought resilience, ii) an increase in anion retention capacity of the soils, thus reducing nitrate leaching rates to aquifers and iii) an improvement of the soil structural stability and infiltration rates, thus minimising the risk of soil erosion events.

Xinxiang MSW Incineration Project,"Xinxiang MSW Incineration Project (hereafter referred to as the project) is located in Xinxiang City, Henan Province,  P.R. China. The Project is invested, constructed and operated by Xinxiang Capital Environment Energy Co., Ltd.
With two 750t/d MSW combustion production lines, the project will treat 1,500 tons of MSW per day. The combustion system is composed of two 750t/d mechanical grate incinerators, matched with one set of 35MW steam turbine generator. The project will process 547,500 tons of MSW every year, and consume 284 tons of 0# light diesel as auxiliary fuel. The MSW combustion line will work 8,000 hours every year, generating 218,830 MWh electricity, of which 179,411 MWh will be exported to the Central China Power Grid (CCPG). The implementation of the project will meet the requirement of local MSW harmless treatment, and significantly improve local environment.
By combusting MSW that would otherwise be disposed of at landfill, the project activity avoids the emission of methane that would be generated under landfill condition. In the meanwhile, by utilizing the waste heat from the combustion of MSW, the boilers can produce steam to generate power to replace the electricity that would otherwise be generated by fossil- fuel fired power plants which are connected to the CCPG. Before the implementation of the project, the local MSW was usually disposed of at nearby landfill, where no landfill gas capturing system erected and the landfill gases are released to atmosphere directly. The equivalent power generated by the project was supplied by the the CCPG. The baseline scenario identified is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation of the project activity.
It is estimated that in the first crediting period of the project (from 19 November 2020 to 18 November 2027), the average annual GHG emission reduction will be 132,263 tCO2e.",Henan province,"Xinxiang Capital Environment Energy Co., Ltd.

Papariko - Restoration of Degraded Mangrove Areas in Kenya,"The objective of this project is to reforest degraded mangroves sites in Kwale, Kilifi, and Tana River counties, in Kenya. The project will create a healthy mangrove ecosystem in degraded lands, starting by planting 220 ha in Shirazi, Bodo, Munje, and Funzi Island, in Kwale county.
The main components of the project are to provide a variety of ecosystem services, climate change mitigation, economic considerations, and active participation of the local community. Without the project, carbon stocks in the project area will continue to decline, as the mangrove ecosystems in Kenya suffer a strong degradation process resulting from anthropogenic (e.g., deforestation for wood consumption) and natural causes (e.g., sea tides).
Under this grouped project, degraded mangroves on the Kenyan coast are restored and replanted. In the first project activity up to 196.000 mangroves will be planted. The species selected for this reforestation project are indigenous and local, namely Rhizophora mucronata, Ceriops tagal and Avicennia marina.
The project will monitor soil conditions to measure changes in soil carbon content and maintain soil nutrient levels to improve water quality compared to the baseline scenario. Mangrove restoration will further increase fish populations, improve biodiversity, and provide other important ecosystem services. To measure the positive impact on biodiversity, annual biomonitoring will be conducted using eDNA.
The empowerment of the population is also central to the project. The labour requirement for the project will be fulfilled with local employment. Therefore, most of the budget for labour and an additional 50/50 share of carbon credit revenues will remain in the country. The project will promote a working family model where more than 50% of women can actively participate in the project.

Western Kenya Soil Carbon Project,"The Western Kenya Soil Carbon Project promotes the adoption of a range of Sustainable Agricultural Land Management technologies including reduced tillage, mulching, cover crops, green manure, composting, soil & water conservation, integrated pest management, and agroforestry on croplands and surrounding areas for watershed restoration and protection. It is implemented western Kenya in three counties: Bungoma, Kakamega and Siaya. Due to its more favourable agroecology, the region is densely populated, and the lands are extensively cultivated with limited natural vegetation. Farmers practice subsistence agriculture, characterized by low inputs, low yields, and continuous loss of soil fertility. The project is managed by Soil-Carbon Certification Services Ltd (SCCS), a non-for-profit company. SCCS is contracting implementation partner (IPs) to support farmers in their land restoration efforts. The project’s main goals are improved yields, food and incomes for farmers, increased resilience to climate change, and climate change mitigation via increased carbon sequestration in soils and plant biomass. The project activities will generate carbon credits that will be certified under the VCS program and monetized and invested in the project activities to ensure sustainability of the project goals. It is a grouped project covering 32,000 ha, with total VCUs 1.87 million tCO2. Participating smallholders are organized in farmer groups for efficient extension services delivery. The groups sign agreements to be project participants after due process of local stakeholders’ consultations and are then entitled to all extension services and support from the project. The group agreements oblige them to adopt and implement SALM technologies on their lands, support project monitoring, and transfer emission reduction units to the project.

Chaco Vivo,"Project Chaco Vivo will be developed under the Verified Carbon Standard and Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standards (VCS – CCBS) as an avoided planned deforestation (APD) REDD+ project. Chaco Vivo will help conserve an area of over 1,800 km2, encompassing over 187,000 hectares (464,000 acres) in Paraguay's Gran Chaco ecosystem. Despite the Gran Chaco’s regional and global significance, the region is one of the most deforested on earth, losing over 1,000 hectares (2,471 acres) of tree cover per day. Project Chaco Vivo will mitigate deforestation pressures in the region and protect this important yet critically threatened ecosystem, which provides habitats to more than 3,400 plant species, 500 bird species, 150 mammals, 120 reptiles, and approximately 100 species of amphibians - including numerous endemic and IUCN red list vulnerable, threatened, and endangered species. 

Chaco Vivo is a People Project at heart with numerous communities living within the Project's Area of Influence (AOI), including Indigenous communities of the Maskoi - an ethnolinguistic group of people of Lengua-Maskoi. The Project Area encompassed by Chaco Vivo is a High Conservation Value Area (HCVA) since it consists of natural habitats of outstanding significance and/or of critical importance due to the special biological, ecological, social, and cultural values. 

Key to Chaco Vivo is a robust social program called the L.I.F.E. Program™ (Land-use Initiatives & Forest Enterprises Program). The L.I.F.E. Program™ will provide a tangible system of socio-economic enrichment programs to improve the livelihoods of marginalized populations. The key objectives of the L.I.F.E.

Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation in Shagang Town,"Shagang Town is located in the central and southern part of Hubei Province, located in the hinterland of Jianghan Plain .The project is located in Shagang Town,Jiangling County, Hubei Province, China, with a total acreage of 13061 ha for single-cropping rice. The project activity is designed to construction the cement ditch and reservoir to realize the reducing of methane emissions by conducting intermittently flooded method instead of continuously flooded method during the cropping season in Shagang Town.
In the baseline scenario, farmers in Shagang Town use continuously flooded method in rice paddies , which means fields have standing water throughout the rice growing season and only dry out for harvest. However, the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition. In the project scenario, farmers in Shagang Town changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation. By controlled the irrigation and drainage according to the needs of rice growth, can save water resources. On the other hand, multiple aeration during rice cultivation can effectively reduce methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions.
Emission reductions of this project are generated by reducing methane emissions of continuously flooded during rice cultivation in baseline scenario. With the project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 4.49 tCO2e/ha for rice is expected.

TAIHE COUNTY BIOGAS POWER GENERATION AND ORGANIC FERTILIZER PROJECT,"Taihe County Biogas Power Generation and Organic Fertilizer Project is located at ShuangXing Village, Shuang fu Town, Taihe County, Fuyang City, Anhui Province, China.This project builds a new livestock and poultry manure management system and collects organic wastes such as manure from many farms to produce biogas power generation and organic fertilizer. Fermentation raw materials are managed by unified collection and transportation. Agricultural waste resources (ie, livestock and poultry wastes in this project) undergo pretreatment and anaerobic fermentation, and the generated biogas is desulfurized and then enters the generator to generate electricity. The waste heat of the generator is used to increase the temperature of the material in the homogenization tank and the fermentation tank. The mud produced by anaerobic fermentation is transported to the nearby farmland through the pipeline network to form an organic ecological cycle industry. The residue is used to produce solid organic fertilizer. The electricity generated is fed into the East China grid, reducing methane and other greenhouse gas emissions. It also avoids the CO2 emissions generated by the power generation process corresponding to the replacement of electricity, thereby achieving greenhouse gas emission reduction.The project activity will reduce GHG in the atmosphere through avoiding methane emissions from anaerobic treatment of manure.

Amazon Guardians REDD+ Project,"The growing threats to the forests of the Peruvian Amazon, such as migratory agriculture, land trafficking illegal logging and illegal gold mining, are causing the alarming degradation of forests; the loss and in some cases the disappearance of the most important flora and fauna in the territory; and the general pollution - deterioration of the country’s most valuable ecosystems. Specifically, illegal (gold) mining have caused tragic damage to part of the Peruvian Amazon. Rivers, streams and soils have been contaminated due to this cause to such degree that it will take many years to remediate and recover -to some extent- their initial state. One of the most affected areas in Peru in terms of deforestation, and specifically due to illegal mining, is the buffer zone of the Tambopata National Reserve and the forests located on the right bank (towards Cusco) of the Interoceanic highway in the region of Madre de Dios.

REDD+ Amazon Guardians purpose is to reduce and avoid deforestation within the conservation, reforestation/afforestation, and ecotourism forest concessions located in the buffer zone of the Tambopata National Reserve and adjacent areas which are highly threatened by illegal mining and traffickers who use these areas for illegal crops. REDD+ Amazon Guardians has been designed and developed with the purpose of protecting these valuable forests and their biodiversity, generating environmental services that allow the capture of CO2 and providing opportunities to improve the quality of life for the communities that live and depend on these areas.

Anaerobic decomposition of organic material in flooded rice fields produces methane, which escapes to the atmosphere primarily by transport through the rice plants. The target of this project is to solve problems of large amount of methane (CH4) emissions and low rice productivity caused by excessive water used during rice cultivation through replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method to shorten the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. Without the implementation of this project that provides technology/measures to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded method would continue to be used and thus the baseline scenario is rice cultivated by continuously flooded method. Soil organic matter under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, therefore the intermittent flooded method is beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction compared to continuously flooded. With the project activity, the estimated amount of GHG emission reduction is 4.52 tCO2e/ha for single-cropping rice. The total GHG emissions reductions is collectively expected to 417,237 tCO2e in the first 7 years with an average annual GHG emission removal of 59,605 tCO2e.

Upscaling Livelihoods and Biodiversity Through Community mobilization and lagoon restoration in Anawasala Kalpitiya,"The carbon sequestered and stored in the coastal wetland ecosystems; mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows are called blue carbon. Sri Lankan coastline consists of blue carbon ecosystems predominating by mangrove ecosystems. The Puttalam lagoon is the second largest lagoon with the largest mangrove extent in Sri Lanka. The heaviest destruction of mangroves also exists in the Puttalam lagoon. As a response to the mass degradation of mangroves, the conservation and restoration process has been activated in this area. The GMSL together with Arinma Holdings commenced a pilot operation to rehabilitate 6000 mangrove plants in selected plots in Anawasala lagoon. The project was done in two phases, phase one we decided that the Rhizophora species was suitable. The number of plants available from both nurseries was 1300, and those plants were used for first round planting in March 2021. Phase two, the fishing community suggested that it would be better to plant propagules, therefore it was confirmed that 3000 plants will be purchases. Those 3000 plants were planted in zone A. After the commencement of the project A dedicated individual was appointed to look after the planted plants for two months. As the two months were coming to an end, the president of the village fishermen's association volunteered to take care of the plants. As of now information given by the Fisheries Society, states the plants planted have grown successfully thus far. 
Objectives:
• As a member of the United Nations global compact, Arinma holdings wishes to align with UN’s SDG hence promote life under water. This project adapted being to our company goals “under Water Stewardship” in order to mitigate climate change.
• Monitor carbon secretion by mangrove eco-systems and to find supporting data for future use.
• It is an untouched topic of research; hence it gives the students at the university the opportunity to engage in research.
• Provide the community with lively hood and food security.",North Western province,"ARINMA HOLDINGS PVT (LTD

RE.GREEN ATLANTIC FOREST REFORESTATION/RESTORATION PROJECT,"The Grouped project aims to implement forest restoration activities throughout the Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome (hereinafter project zone), mainly in substitution of exotic grasslands formerly used for cattle raising, but also on lands used for annual agriculture (e.g. soy, sugarcane, etc), perennial agriculture of low carbon stocks (coffee, citrus, etc) and/or other non-native ecosystems. The project zone comprises 17 States of the Brazilian territory and is located within climatic/edaphic conditions suitable for plant growth and encompasses a region of high value for biodiversity conservation.
The initial objective is to restore approximately 88,400 hectares of forest cover within the project zone and the subsequent sequestration and storage of carbon in several carbon pools, such as aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, litter, dead wood, and soil organic carbon. Net greenhouse gas removals are estimated in approximately 47,634,218 tCO2e over 100 years, equivalent to the annual removal of 476,342 tCO2e.
The removal of GHG (CO2) by the project’s activities is a consequence of the biological sequestration through plant’s photosynthesis, which potential is increased by the implementation of a continuum of human induced forest restoration activities, ranging from assisted natural regeneration to full planting, including sometimes the use of commercial woody from native species to trigger initial restoration process.
In the absence of the project, the project areas would remain dominated by land-uses of low-carbon stock and/or continue to be occupied by non-native ecosystems as a consequence of anthropic activities practiced without properly sustainable management.
The project’s first instance has 346.5 hectares,is located in the municipality of Eunápolis-Bahia/Brazil, and it is expected to generate 181,451 tCO2 over 50 years, equivalent to 3,629 tCO2/ha/year.

NaturAll Carbon Program – Conservation Agriculture and Land Management in Brazil,"The project “NaturAll Carbon Program – Conservation Agriculture and Land Management in Brazil” belongs to NaturAll Carbon Limited and is located in Brazil, South America. The area is located in 23 states, covering a total area of 414.8 million hectares. The extension of the project covers four Brazilian biomes, Caatinga, Cerrado, Atlantic Forest and Pampa. It is very important to highlight that in order to preserve forests and swamps, lands from Amazon and Pantanal biomes will not be part of this project. As the leading causes of high GHG emissions and agricultural soil degradation have already been identified and are linked to inadequate management practices. But, although there are several studies and research data from all over Brazil, until now, there has been no efficient program to raise awareness and support rural producers in the transition to conservationist soil management on their agricultural property. Adopting conservation practices in the areas of agricultural and livestock activities, the goal will be to help reduce and remove GHG from the atmosphere, increase Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), avoid soil degradation (physical, chemical, and biological), improving soil fertility and productivity, creating a better resilience to extreme weather events, providing food security and preserving natural resources and their ecosystem services. The choice of instances inserted in the project will be based on implementing one or more regenerative or conservationist practices from November 1st, 2019, which are not common in the region, and there is additionality. The project intends to expand over time and reach multiple instances, and a range of agriculture and livestock activities in the four Brazilian biomes described previously to help drive resilient and sustainable agropastoral systems in these locations.",,"NaturAll Carbon Limited

Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation in Dayi County,"The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice
cultivation is conducted in Dayi County within Chengdu City, Sichuan Province of China,
with a total acreage of 12,514 ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of
this project, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice
was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic
matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4)
because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to
water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the
continuously flooded.
This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which
results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity
by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which
shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4
emission can be declined by an average of 48%1. Hence, with the proposed project activity,
an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 4.58 tCO2e/ha for single-cropping rice is
expected. Annual average estimation of GHG emission reductions from the project activity
is 57,352 tCO2e/year, and the total GHG emission reductions are 573,520 tCO2e during the
fixed 10 years crediting period.
This project aims to:
- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;
- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;
- Increase the number of local individuals who have relevant skills due to diversified

RE.GREEN AMAZON FOREST REFORESTATION/RESTORATION PROJECT,"The Grouped project aims to implement forest restoration activities throughout the Brazilian Amazon Forest Biome (hereinafter project zone), mainly in substitution of exotic grasslands formerly used for cattle raising, but also on lands used for annual agriculture (e.g. soy, sugarcane, etc), perennial agriculture of low carbon stocks (coffee, citrus, etc) and/or other non-native ecosystems. The project zone comprises 9 States of the Brazilian territory and is located within climatic/edaphic conditions suitable for plant growth and encompasses a region of high value for biodiversity conservation. The initial objective is to restore approximately 181,500 hectares of forest cover within the project zone and the subsequent sequestration and storage of carbon in several carbon pools, such as aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, litter, dead wood, and soil organic carbon. Net greenhouse gas removals are estimated in approximately 107,244,226 tCO2e over 100 years, equivalent to the annual removal of 1,072,442 tCO2e. The removal of GHG (CO2) by the project’s activities is a consequence of the biological sequestration through plant’s photosynthesis, which potential is increased by the implementation of a continuum of human induced forest restoration activities, ranging from assisted natural regeneration to full planting, including sometimes the use of commercial woody from native species to trigger initial restoration process. In the absence of the project, the project areas would remain dominated by land-uses of low-carbon stock and/or continue to be occupied by non-native ecosystems as a consequence of anthropic activities practiced without properly sustainable management. The project’s first instance has 8826.16 hect and is located in the municipality of Maracaçume/Brazil. It is expected to generate 5,059,265 tCO2e over 50 years, equivalent to 101,185 tCO2e/year.

Boomitra Carbon Farming in East Africa through Soil Enrichment,"This project aims to help farmers deploy improved cropland management and regenerative agricultural practices in the croplands of Kenya. Over time, these croplands have undergone severe degradation due to anthropological factors, environmental conditions, and recurring natural calamities.

Around 75% of the population of Kenya is dependent on agriculture, and the sector supports a majority of the country’s food requirements. However, since agricultural production is largely rain-fed and around 80% of Kenya’s geography comprises arid and semi-arid regions, the occurrence of erratic rains and frequent droughts has imposed constraints on its productivity and stability.

In addition to natural disasters like droughts, degradation of land is greatly accelerated by unsustainable land use and management practices. Furthermore, in several parts of the country, soils are deficient in nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium, thereby resulting in poor vegetation cover. In this context, the opportunity to introduce improved cropland management practices will significantly help the croplands of the region and restore soil organic matter to their land, creating carbon removals while improving overall soil health.

The project activities include the adopt of practices such as no-till or reduced tilling, mulching with crop residues, reduced synthetic fertilizer application, using organic manures, water management, improved crop planting and harvesting methods, and agroforestry activities. These practices are proven ways to increase soil organic carbon, preventing further degradation of croplands and their soils, and enabling farmers to improve their productivity.","Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda","Boomitra Inc

Silvopastoral carbon project of Uruguay,"This grouped project consists of afforestation and reforestation activities, with an innovative silvopastoral system design taking place in Uruguay. The project activity involves the inclusion of exotic and native trees on grassland, which is in a degraded state due to a long history of overgrazing. Trees are introduced at a low density with a unique plantation frame so that both livestock grazing and forestry activities are integrated without displacing any previous activity. Some instances also include a novel intensive grazing management. 
The main aim is to sequester atmospheric carbon through photosynthesis, to be stored in aboveground and belowground tree biomass, as well as dead wood, litter, and soil organic carbon pools. The most common tree species will be Eucalyptus grandis (W.Hill), however alternative species including various native species will be included as part of the project.
This system is an alternative to the conventional high-density, large-scale plantations for pulp or sawn wood that are the most common forestry activities in the country. Despite the numerous barriers for its implementation, management, and harvesting, it is an option for farmers who want to include trees as shelter and shadow without leaving behind animal husbandry and replacing the native grass cover. Because of the low volume of production, normally the labor during planting and forest management is done by local people and the timber is sold to nearby small-scale sawmills, contributing to the local communities by providing a source of qualified jobs in the primary and secondary sectors. 
This project does not only contribute to the local and regional economy but also has a net positive impact on social and environmental aspects. With the utilization of native species, new job positions will be created in existing or new-to-exist nurseries, among other social benefits.",,"Climit

SCALA LAOS AGROFORESTRY PROJECT 2,"The proposed grouped project “SCALA 2 Laos Agroforestry Project’ is seeking carbon credits for carbon removal within an area of 31,500 ha in Nakathing-Nongkapath and Phou Talava Production Forests Areas (PFA) in Lao PDR.  These areas present a dynamic landscape consisting of a mosaic of settlements, agricultural land, regenerated or fallow forest and remnant forest ranging from high altitude mountainous areas to riverine valleys. The first instance, called ‘SCALA Laos Agroforestry Project 2.1 - Phase 1’ will be implemented in an area of 4,713 ha.  The remaining area will be implemented in subsequent project instances. 

The reforestation project aims to establish eucalyptus plantations consisting of ~90% of plantations with the remaining ~10% set aside for conservation management. The project follows a participatory approach to identify suitable areas for plantations including frequent consultations with the communities according to the FPIC principle. The Plantation Model is based on agroforestry systems allowing for agriculture crops to be grown between the tree rows. The project areas have been heavily impacted by logging and shifting cultivation. The area is also heavily impacted by use of defoliants, carpet bombing and chemical spraying during the American-Vietnam war, causing degradation of forest landscapes. The project will make productive use of degraded land and provide significant local and regional employment opportunities across operations. Plantation establishment will require UXO clearance which will provide community health and safety benefits over large areas and unlock the land for use beyond the life of the project. 

The project will increase carbon sequestration and reduce GHG emissions by establishing forest cover in degraded land areas. It is estimated that over a crediting period of 30 years, the project will generate  9,229,270 tCO2e of removals, with an estimated  1,386,148 tCO2e removals from the first project instance.",Khammouan Province & Saravane Province,"SilviCarbon Lao Sole Company Ltd.

Foumbouni-Mitsamiouli solar farm,"Foumbouni-Mitsamiouli solar farm involves the construction and operation of two solar photovoltaic parks of 4 MWp each in Foumbouni and Mitsamiouli, respectively in the south and north regions of the island of Ngazidja, Comoros. The solar power plants are equipped with 10,080 modules of 405 Wp each mounted on tracker single array, with a backtracking system. They are coupled with 1 MW / 2 MWh batteries that allow the solar farm to operate under 2 modes: hybridization and islanding to export power to the national grid.
The bundled project is the first solar power plant on the island and its power generation is off-taken and distributed by SONELEC (national power utility company) that was prior to the implementation of the project activity only relying on fossil fuel fired power plants. Therefore, the clean and renewable energy produced by the power plant is substituting to the grid electricity and cut down GHG emissions from baseline fossil fuel intensive grid mix. Apart from emission reductions, the benefits of the project comprise, among others, improvement of energy self-sufficiency of the country, as well as creation of local employment.
Today, electricity in the Union of Comoros is produced mostly by diesel generators.

Ground-Truth® Australian Orchards,"Regenerative farming practices are attracting significant interest within Australia's tree crop industries. Practices that are being trialled and introduced include: Reduced reliance on chemical fertilisers and pesticides, cover cropping, improved water use efficiency, establishment of new permanent tree crops, revegetation of areas surrounding orchards and adoption of carbon improvement management programs.
Implementing such practice changes are challenging as it requires up-front investment with considerable delay in financial return. This is particularly the case in: Non producing orchards during the establishment phase, where no or little income is generated for the first seven years and producing orchards in an environment of falling prices and rising input costs.  
This programme aims to provide additional economic support to farmers to fund, implement and maintain new regenerative farming practices that would alternatively not have been implemented, scaled up or maintained if it was not for this additional financial support. 
This programme is designed as a grouped project, focussing on tree crops in Australia, with the specific aim to generate carbon offset revenue from non-producing and producing orchards to finance regenerative agricultural practices.  These practices will improve SOC levels, but also lead to a reduction of chemical and energy inputs per unit of production. 
The potential of these practices is not being realised, as there is not a clear cost-benefit proposition, which this programme now aims to address. 
This project will also account for the additional biomass carbon generated in qualifying orchards established after the project start date, in accordance to the guidance under this option in VM0042.
Pilot assessments have shown that implementing the practices listed above can generate significant improvements in soil carbon levels. These improvements could amount to approximately 20 tonnes of CO2e reductions and removals/ha/year",Australia,"Carbon Friendly Pty Ltd.

Chirisa REDD+ Project,"This is a VCS-large scale project class implemented to protect the Chirisa Safari Area in the Midlands province of Zimbabwe. The project area of 144,796 hectares is owned by the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZPWMA) and is leased to Carbon Green Africa (CGA) and Carbon Green Investments (CGI) for the purposes of establishing and running a REDD+ project. The partnership of CGA and CGI, hereinafter Carbon Green, is the project proponent. The main objective of the agreement is to establish a REDD+ project, with the aims of:
●	REDD+ carbon credit generation
●	Contribution to sustainable conservation in Zimbabwe
●	Development of a strategy for invasive species management
●	Fire and roads management
●	Game, water and habitat management
●	Strengthening antipoaching law enforcement
●	Wildlife population management
●	Promoting wildlife tourism and related activities
●	Community livelihoods enhancement 
The project proponent works in partnership with ZPWMA and adjacent communities in 12 wards across the surrounding 3 districts of Gokwe North, Gokwe South and Binga in a REDD+ scheme. Together the protected Safari Area and surrounding communal land make a project zone of 490,710 Ha. The project zone forms part of the last remaining corridor for animal movement and migration. 
The project aims to generate GHG emission reductions through 4 main strategic approaches:
1.	Direct forest and wildlife conservation to stop clearing and cutting of wood and wildlife poaching by implementing standard monitoring activities such as patrols
a.	Training to support law enforcement.
b.	Regular forest monitoring and carbon accounting will be done through aerial (remote sensing) and ground methods.
c.	Biodiversity assessments will be done via aerial methods supported by ground transects-based observations and citizen science. 
2.	Engagement and capacity building with key community and government stakeholders to willfully participate in one climate change mitigation goal
3.	Distribution of performance-based benefits to project zone communities delivered through local institutions 
4.	Implementation of sustainable alternative livelihood activities identified through a robust gender and inter-generationally sensitive participatory rural appraisal process
a.	Livelihood activities will include both subsistence and entrepreneurial initiatives in the fields such as agriculture, small scale, high-intensive controlled environment growing systems (greenhouses) 
b.	Vocational training on manufacturing of products for export
The baseline (without-project) scenario is unplanned deforestation due to the continual clearing of land for small-scale agricultural expansion and land degradation caused by overgrazing of cattle, driven by increasing populations and decreasing yields. The livelihoods of communities continue to decline, increasing the threat on the already declining biodiversity of the project zone due to erratic weather conditions. 
The project's clear CCB objectives are:
Climate – Avoided emissions of 14,280,937 tCO2e over a 30-year period at an average of 476,031 tCO2e per year, and in the process assist the human and wildlife population of the project zone to adapt to climate change impacts through income diversification, climate smart agricultural techniques, and habitat protection. 
Community - Alleviate poverty for more than 21,000 households, total of more than 90,000 individuals, specifically targeting women, vulnerable, and marginalized people. The project will also improve health, education and general social and infrastructure services within the project zone.
Biodiversity - Enhancement of the population of plant and wildlife species by conserving and maintaining vulnerable, threatened, and endangered species through habitat protection, controlled law enforcement, as well as rehabilitation and wildlife restocking.",Midlands and Matebelend North Provinces,"Carbon Green Investments Guernsey Limited

MOTOR VERDE FORESTRY CARBON PROJECT - GRANDAS DE SALIME (SPAIN),"The Motor Verde Forestry Carbon Project – Grandas de Salime (Spain) consists in the reforestation of 86.94 ha in Grandas de Salime, Principality of Asturias, Spain. 
The land over which reforestation is set to occur is part of the “Sierra de la Cuesta and Villarpedre” communal forest and is owned by the Grandas de Salime City Council. The area was affected by two wildfires in April and October 2017 that devastated the forest. Since then, no-human induced measures to restore the forest have been implemented. Furthermore, natural regeneration has been and continues to be impeded by the shrubland that now covers the area, thereby preventing natural regeneration.
Being an area with steep slopes and shallow soils, the land has been devoid of any forest vegetation since the fire and rainfall is now causing soil loss due to surface runoff. The hillside on which the works were carried out is located on the banks of the Salime Reservoir, which pours its waters directly into the Navia River.
The reforestation work consisted in extracting the burned material by using either the walking excavator felling head or a chainsaw. The burned material was then moved to the forest/logging trail and then a clearing was made using the felling head coupled to the walking excavator, whilst digging was underway. Then, the plots were treated, and seedlings planted by hand. A 10-metre wide strip adjacent to the clearing was made to serve as an auxiliary strip for fire-fighting purposes.
The project will remove a total amount of 50,370 tCO2 over a 100-year period, which works out at an average reduction of 504 tCO2 per year.
The project is part of Motor Verde initiative (see below). In Grandas de Salime, by means of recovering the forest that was lost in April and October 2017, the project will yield economic, social and environmental benefits. It will sequester carbon, it will restore ecosystems, and it will provide the local population with training and subsequent employment.",Asturias,Multiple Proponents,,Registration requested,1449,,,Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use,ARR,AR-ACM0003,87 Hectares,,AENOR International S.A.U.,,"1st, 09/01/2022 - 08/01/2072",,,,,,3813
Chestnut Carbon Conservation Project,"The importance of American forests to the global ecosystem and climate is central to the work of Chestnut Carbon, LLC, a US-based company that seeks to conserve and restore functional forestland throughout the United States for the primary purpose of increasing carbon sequestration. By the year 2030, Chestnut Carbon anticipates conserving up to 500,000 acres of land using long-term carbon management. This ambitious plan contrasts with regional common practice among the sellers of these lands: extractive timber harvesting to compensate for decreasing revenues from adjacent agricultural and ranching operations over time due to soil compaction and degradation. By extending rotation ages on these at-risk forests, the project increases carbon storage relative to the baseline case, as well as increases biodiversity and diversity in forest structure. 
To extend rotation ages across the project area, the project activity includes transitioning forestland into sustainable, uneven-aged silvicultural systems, where appropriate. These transition activities include the application of special silvicultural treatments that accelerate the recruitment of trees into standing dead wood, among other treatments. Estimated average GHG emission reductions are 221,312 tons CO2 equivalent per year, with total reductions over the first project crediting period of 5,532,801 CO2e. PAIs will be located across the contiguous United States and southern Alaska. To ensure sustainability in management, Forest Carbon Works requires PAI forestland to be certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) prior to commercial harvesting under the group certificate managed by Forest Carbon Works (SCS-FM/COC-009247). Approved management plans shall meet both FSC requirements and the requirements specified by the management policies of Forest Carbon Works related to the promotion of even-aged management, biodiversity, water quality and wildlife habitat.",AR,"Forest Carbon Works PBC

DEVELOPING VOLUNTARY CARBON MARKET  PROJECT FOR FARMERS ADOPTNG  ALTERNATE WETTING AND DRYING (AWD)  METHOD FOR RICE CULTIVATION,"Flooding conditions in rice fields emit the most CH4, while intermittently flooded rice fields create a high quantity of N2O. Emissions of GHGs from rice fields can be reduced by modifying irrigation patterns, regulating organic additives, and using suitable rate and quantity of Nitrogen fertilizer. Irrigation practice such as Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) method has been observed to reduce GHG emissions in comparison to the traditional method 
of flooding. The time intervals between dry and wet conditions help in the transition from aerobic to anaerobic soil conditions, thus alternate wetting, and drying method leads in a significant reduction in methane generation1. Thus, the project employs AWD method to reduce the CH4 emissions. This will also lead to reduction in the water consumption, thus decreasing the input cost of the farmer. Before implementation of the project activity, the farmers were following the traditional flooding method, leading to the emissions of methane in the atmosphere. The project proponent conducted training programs and meeting with the farmers to make them aware about the benefits of adopting AWD, followed by the distribution and installation of AWD pipe in the fields of enrolled farmers. The first instance of the project is located in Haryana state covering an area of 4973 hectares.

In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 4.32tCO2e/ha for single-cropping rice is expected. Annual average estimation of GHG emission reductions from the project activity is 57,504 tCO2e/year, and the total GHG emission reductions are 575,040 tCO2e during the fixed 10 years crediting period.
This project aims to:
 Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;

Xiushan Water Management with Rice Cultivation,"The project is to change from continuously flooded regimes to intermittently flooded regimes during rice cultivation in Xiushan County, Chongqing City, China, with a total acreage of 17,489 ha of single-cropping rice. A total of 8,521 households (36,214 farmers) were involved in the project. Without the project, local villagers would not have access to intermittently flooded technology and intact facilities to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously flooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Due to the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in the paddy soil under flooded conditions, a large amount of methane can be released, so the intermittently flooded method is more conducive to water efficiency, improving rice yield and reducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.
The implementation activities of the project include promoting intermittently flooded technology, technical training for the farmers, facility repair and replacement, etc. According to the needs of rice growth, farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in the rainy season.
The project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions by 385,462 tCO2e in the first seven-year period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 55,066 tCO2e. The project aims to reduce GHG and mitigate climate changes, increase rice productivity resulting in higher living standards for local farmers and provide more job opportunities.",Chongqing,"Chongqing Gengfang Agricultural Development Co., Ltd.

Hence, the motivation to establish a sustainable agricultural system in orchards and vineyards that can further minimize emissions and is capable of efficiently sequestering carbon within the atmosphere.

This is a pioneering project that follows the SCOVY (i.e., Sustainable Carbon Orchards and Vineyards) methodology, which is currently being developed by We-Agri. This methodology will be the object of future works that will encompass different fruit crops. The main goal is to shift commercial fruit orchards into sustainable agricultural systems endorsed for the issuance of high-quality carbon credits by implementing smart-climate agricultural practices.

The Milopri grouped project is situated within the western Galilee region in the northern part of Israel. The project location has an overall area of circa 3,000 hectares which are owned by 25 different Israeli agricultural cooperative villages. These farms are consolidated into one Centralized packhouse & logistic center - Milopri Agricultural Cooperative. 

The project activities aim at increasing the capacity of soil to sequester carbon and reducing nitrogenous fertilizer-related greenhouse gas emissions. The project also holistically aims at achieving sustainable management practices which not only improve soil health and productivity but can also achieve socio-economic development in the project area.",,"We-Agri

Inner Mongolia Yitulihe-Genhe Afforestation Project,"The Inner Mongolia Yitulihe-Genhe Afforestation Project (hereafter “the project”) is located in northern part of the western side of Greater Khingan Mountains, Hulun Buir City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, P.R.C. The project is jointly implemented byInner Mongolia Yitulihe Forestry Co. LTD and Genhe Forest Industry Co. LTD, both of which belong to the China Inner Mongolia Forest Industry Group. The project is designed to establish forests on degraded lands previously deforested and/or converted (croplands or settlements).
Most of the lands to be planted were deforested since 1950s. Significant deforested lands were converted to croplands and settlements to support livelihood for increased residents. Other land remained as barren lands and have never been reforested since then. Due to human disturbance, desertification and sandification as well as soil erosion, the barren lands are degraded and degrading which would continue under the without project scenario.
2,059.4 ha of forest is to be established by direct planting on degraded lands in 12 forestry farm of Yitulihe Forestry Bureau and 12 forestry farms of Genhe Forestry Bureau. 66.3%% of reforestation activities are carried out in a mixture of different tree species for a purpose of enhancing resilience.
Major species and Afforestation models include 480.64 ha of Spruce (Picea meyeri Rehd.et Wils), 214.6 ha of Mongolian Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica Litv.), 546.0 ha of mixture of spruce and larch (Larix gmelinii (Rupr.)

CARBON GROUP PROGRAM FOR SUSTAINABLE LOW CARBON CROP AND GRASSLAND MANAGEMENT IN ARGENTINA,"The project intends to include producers dedicated to extensive agriculture (corn, soybeans, wheat, sunflower, cotton, and other crops), and extensive cattle ranching, mostly cattle and grazing grasslands, pastures, agropastoral, and silvo-pastoral. Given the characteristics of the country, farm and ranch  production dates from no more than 200 years ago.
During most of the 20th century, the farms were managed in a rather extensive manner and with aggressive tillage systems, which caused widespread declines in the organic matter content of the soils. This lasted until the end of that century, when for different reasons the producers adopted zero tillage systems, which are what predominate today (more than 90%).
The projects to be implemented are expected to mitigate climate change both by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and by capturing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and storing it as stable carbon in the soil, which must be recarbonized. The greatest efforts to reduce GHG emissions will be due to the adoption of better nitrogen fertilization technologies, which include alternative sources of nitrogen and variable rate fertilization that reduce nitrous oxide (N2) emissions from fertilized soils, the intensification of agricultural rotations with greater incorporation of winter crops, nitrogen fixing species and cover crops, and improved grazing management in livestock, which increase carbon stocks and with improvements in digestibility that reduce methane (CH4) emissions due to enteric fermentation. 
It is estimated that with these improvements, which are not currently widespread even among producers, it will be possible to reduce between 0.5 and 3 tons of CO2e/ha/year. Obviously, the total amount will depend on the area committed by the producers. This area is expected to reach more than 160 thousand hectares. If this is so, it is expected to mitigate almost 2 million tons CO2e at the end of this project.",Argentina,"Carbon Group Agro-Climatic Solutions LLC

Family Forest Carbon Program - Central Appalachia,"The Family Forest Carbon Program (FFCP), administered by the Family Forest Impact Foundation (FFIF), is an innovative, incentive-based program engaging private family and other non-industrial private forest landowners throughout the United States in improved forest management practices, promoting forest health, carbon sequestration and storage, and other environmental conservation and protection practices. 

Through its grouped project design, the FFCP is able to engage and achieve economies of scale with smaller non-industrial forestland owners, reaching ownerships that have been largely unrepresented in voluntary carbon markets. The FFCP solves challenges to small forest holdings participation in carbon projects, by reducing cost and complexity of participation. 

FFCP provides incentive payments to forest landowners to implement climate-smart practices that increase sequestration and storage of carbon. The FFCP further connects enrolled landowners with technical assistance from local consulting foresters, helping family landowners transition to long-term, sustainable forest management. 

The first project activities implemented in the FFCP program (directed towards the U.S. Central Appalachia region) include: Growing Mature Forests (GMF) –20-year, renewable agreement to limit timber harvest (with imposition of minimum residual basal area and riparian buffers and prohibition on high-grading/diameter limit cuts), thereby increasing net growth. The GMF practice, compared to common practice high-grading in the region, is expected to generate net emission reductions of ~1.6 t CO2e/acre/year. total GHG emission reductions and removals.",PA,"Family Forest Impact Foundation

Cauaxi REDD+ Grouped Project,"The Cauaxi REDD+ Grouped Project (hereafter called GPD) aims to conserve forests in several private properties located in northeast portion of Pará, close to the border with Maranhão. The Cauaxi River, which gives the project its name, is one of the tributaries of the Capim River, located in the central portion of the project's reference region, at Paragominas municipality.
The GPD aims to create positive economic incentives for landowners to conserve rainforests in private areas that are vulnerable to degradation and deforestation, while contributing to net positive climate impacts as well as benefit to traditional communities and conserve biodiversity. By joining BRcarbon (hereafter known as BRC), forest owners can access funds from the carbon voluntary market to develop conservation and monitoring efforts in their forests. A partnership between BRC and landowners will result in the legal protection of forests, forest monitoring using satellite images, biodiversity inventory (including fauna e flora species), and forest biomass inventory in a broad scale, using 
a upscaling approach based on field collection, drone-borne and satellite sensors such as LiDAR (light detection and ranging). In addition, we will involve surveillance of property, wildfire monitoring, fire prevention and fighting, threatened species protection and social activities with traditional communities. 
As a result, BRC expects to enhance the climate impact of carbon projects, helping communities and biodiversity. The Cauaxi REDD+ Grouped Project is part of the company's initiative to promote forest conservation using the financial flows of the carbon market.

IMPROVING LIVELIHOOD OF FARMERS VIA CARBON FINANCE PROJECT IN NEPAL,"The project area is in Nepal which is a home to a plethora of flora and fauna which spread across Terai to the middle to mountain of the country. Around 5962.03 (000 ha) of land was under forest cover in 2020. Forest Act 1993 recognizes two essential kinds (national and private) and five auxiliary kinds of forest beneath national forest (Government Managed, Community Managed, Protected Forests, Leasehold Forest, Religious Forest, and Private Forest). Deforestation, degradation and fragmentation of natural habitat of wildlife are a serious threat to forests of the country which alarm the need for protection of biodiversity. Adopting agroforestry practices is the best possible solution as this system can avail basic needs of an individual and rehabilitate the lost ecosystem. The primary objectives of agroforestry are to produce food, fodder, fuel-wood, and/or timber. There can also be co-benefits such as carbon sequestration, water quality enhancement, soil protection, and biodiversity conservation. 
Agroforestry system in Nepal is a traditional and ancient practice. Farmers in the hills have expanded the number of agroforestry trees on their farmland in response to forest degradation and deforestation, to meet their immediate demand for fodder, fuelwood, and small-sized timber products. The agroforestry systems deliver several forest products, agriculture products and ecosystem services which may enhance social well-being of the local farmers, national and global community. The small and marginal farmers are almost unaware of the scientific importance (economic and environmental aspects) of agroforestry, short- and long-term benefits, and technical requirements.

CLIMATE SUSTAINABILITY THROUGH HORTICULTURE PROJECT IN INDIA,"This is an Afforestation/Reforestation Project on degraded and fallow land and lies within the boundaries of India. The purpose of this grouped project is to promote the restoration of degraded and fallow land and improve the living conditions of farmers by planting horticulture and commercial species (indigenous species preferred). This is a grouped project.

The first project activity instance under the program is located in the state of Maharashtra, district Nandurbar in India. TATA Communications Limited (TCL) has implemented the VPA01 from 01-April-2022 with the coordination of implementing entity Collectives for Integrated Livelihood Initiatives (CINI). The area covered in this VPA is up to 303 hectare with an average land holding of approximately 0.40 hectare or one acre per farmer.
The villages under the project area predominantly have an agrarian economy. The conditions of lands covered under the project are either barren & fallow land with seasonal crops grown. The plantation under the project activity will lead to the sequestration of CO2 at a faster pace. 

The technology used for the tree plantation is simple as it just involves procurement of saplings from designated nurseries and planting various empty and barren locations of the districts.

Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation in Xuwen County,"The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Xuwen County within Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province of China, with a total acreage of 6,612 ha for double-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.
This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 9.05 tCO2e/ha for double-cropping rice is expected. Annual average estimation of GHG emission reductions from the project activity is 59,856 tCO2e/year, and the total GHG emission reductions are 598,560 tCO2e during the fixed 10 years crediting period.
This project aims to:
- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;
- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;
- Increase the number of local individuals who have relevant skills due to diversified educational opportunities from trainings;
- Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers.",Guangdong Province,"Xuwen Xinpenggang Building Materials Co., Ltd.

MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENHANCING RURAL LIVELIHOODS THROUGH PLANTATIONS RAISED TO PROVIDE RAW MATERIAL TO THE PAPER INDUSTRY,"The proposed project activity under VCS will mobilize resource-poor farmers to raise tree plantations on vacant farmlands. It proposes to link resource poor farmers and end users of wood products in order to optimize the land use and to facilitate the co-ordination of wood producers, agronomists, industry, social enterprises and non-governmental organizations to improve the livelihood opportunities of rural households. The project activity is implemented on the degraded farmlands or lands used for rainfed subsistence agriculture. 
Various environment friendly technology-based agroforestry practices and Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) will be adopted to help climate change adaptation and mitigation as part of sustainable land management.

This project will optimise the land use and generate Emission Reductions (ERs). The amount of carbon sequestered through the project activity will be measured and  quantified with reference to a baseline to determine the Emission Reductions (ERs) generated. The ERs will be calculated through quantifying  Above Ground Biomass, Below Ground Biomass and Soil Organic Carbon. In the absence of the project, the lands would have remained degraded and the resource poor farmers would have continued to practice subsistence agriculture. 

The participation of small and marginal farmers as part of the VCS project makes this initiative unique in contributing to their land use choice, improvement of livelihood opportunities and in promoting their capacity to organize and implement climate change mitigation initiatives.

The project implements reforestation on 13,500 ha of degraded private lands in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Orissa. The reforestation activities under the project were initiated after 1 April 2020.

VCS PROJECT FOR FARMERS ADOPTING ALTERNATE WETTING AND DRYING (AWD) METHOD FOR RICE CULTIVATION IN MADHYA  PRADESH,"Rice is the country's most significant agricultural product; it is grown on 43.86 million hectares in India and contributes to more than 20% of world rice output (158.2 Tg in 2013).
Rice is farmed in practically every state in India, and its production is directly related to the country's food security. Additionally, it is a significant source of income and employment. Rice production, on the other hand, is a substantial source of critical and long-lasting GHGs such as CH 4 and N 2 O, posing a huge threat to sustainable agriculture. Rice fields provide approximately 30% and 11% of total agricultural CH 4 and N 2 O emissions, respectively. According to early US-EPA study, paddy in India produced around 37.8 Tg CH 4 per year. GHG emissions from rice fields may be minimized by changing irrigation patterns, managing organic additions, and utilizing the appropriate rate and amount of nitrogen fertilizer. Irrigation practices such as alternate wetting and drying (AWD) have been shown to lower GHG emissions when compared to typical flooding methods. The time intervals between dry and wet circumstances aid in the shift from aerobic to anaerobic soil conditions,
resulting in a considerable reduction in methane output. As a result, the project adopts the AWD approach to minimize CH 4 emissions. This will also result in a reduction in water use, lowering the farmer's input costs. Prior to the execution of the project activity, the farmers used the traditional flooding approach, which resulted in methane emissions into the atmosphere. The project proponent along with local implementation partner held training sessions and meetings with farmers to educate them on the benefits of using AWD, which was followed by the distribution and installation of AWD pipe in the fields of registered farmers. Location: The first instance of the project is located in Madhya Pradesh (Hoshangabad, Raisen, Sehore and Bhopal districts).

The project involves 60,360 ha corn field and 82,341 ha soybean field.
The project is expected to reduce GHG emissions by no tillage and applying organic fertilizer, since no-tillage can reduce soil disturbance and reduce the loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) compared to conventional tillage. And applying organic fertilizer can reduce nitrous oxide emission compared to synthetic fertilizer. Moreover, the project is expected to increase SOC by straw returning, since straw contains a large amount of organic matter and trace elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, returning straw to the field can effectively increase soil organic matter (SOM).

Shanxi Jingle Afforestation Project,"Shanxi Jingle Afforestation Project (hereafter as “the project”) locates in Jingle County, Xinzhou City, Shanxi Province of North China. The aim of the project is to increase carbon sequestration and contribute to local sustainable development by planting trees on the barren mountains. The project was implemented by the project proponent Jingle County Sailing Carbon Sink Development Co. Ltd.
40151.69 ha of forest is to be planted by direct planting on barren lands in Jingle County, which has jurisdiction over 6 towns: Echeng Town, Dujiacun Town, Kangjiahui Town, Fengrun Town, Shuanglu Town, Wangcun Town; 6 townships: Duanjiazhai Township, Xinxiang Township, Shenyugou Township, Niangzishen Township, Suopo Township, Chiniwa Township; and 223 administrative villages. All the project sites were previously barren lands. There is no natural renewal and afforestation before the project. 
The planted trees are native species of Pinus tabuliformis, Larix gmelinii and Prunus dacidiana. The implementation of the afforestation project will generate GHG emission removals and mitigate climate change; improve soil and water conservation and forest cover; enhance local biodiversity by increasing the connectivity of forests and bring income and job opportunities for local communities and residents.
The project is expected to generate GHG emission removals of 14,926,485 tCO2e in 60 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 248,774.75 tCO2e.",Shanxi Province,"Jingle County Sailing Carbon Sink Development Co. LTD

Suihuang Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation,"The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Suicheng District and Huanglo Town within Suixi County, Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province of China, with a total acreage of 6,545 ha for double-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.
This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 9.15 tCO2e/ha for double-cropping rice is expected. Annual average estimation of GHG emission reductions from the project activity is 59,906 tCO2e/year, and the total GHG emission reductions are 599,060 tCO2e during the fixed 10 years crediting period.
This project aims to:
- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;
- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;
- Increase the number of local individuals who have relevant skills due to diversified educational opportunities from trainings;
- Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers.",Guangdong Province,"Xuwen Xinpenggang Building Materials Co., Ltd.
