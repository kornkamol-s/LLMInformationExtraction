The spatial extent of the project electricity\nsystem consists of the power plants that are physically connected through transmission and\ndistribution lines to the project activity and that can be dispatched without significant transmission\nconstraints. The project is connected to the Glow grid which in turn is connected to the national\ngrid. Therefore, the national grid is considered as the ultimate connected grid. The spatial extent\nfor the heat (steam) system is similar, including the heat\/steam generating systems that are\nphysically connected to the project activity and that can be displaced without significant\nconstraints. The heat (steam) requirements of the project are met by the steam extracted from the\ncogeneration plants of Glow grid. As the emissions get accounted in the electricity component\ntherefore to avoid double counting and applying conservative principle the emission factor for\nsteam has been considered as zero. The fuel requirement is for incineration purpose. Natural gas\nis being used as the fuel.\nFor the CHPO-chlor-alkali process (baseline scenario), the spatial extent of the project boundary\nis defined as follows:\nFuel, Heat (Steam), Electricity (including sources)\nC 3H 6 C H O CHPO Plant 3 6\n(C 3H 6 + Cl 2 + 2NaOH --> C 3H 6O + CL , NaOH 2 2NaCl + H 2O) Waste \/ By-products\n(Chlor-Alkali)\nFor the HPPO process (proposed project activity) the geographic project boundary encompasses:\nv3.2 9\n\n[['HPPO Plant\\n(C 3H 6 + H 2O 2 --> C 3H 6O + H 2O)', None], [None, 'Waste \/ By-products']]\n[['', 'Source', None, '', 'Gas', '', 'Included?', '', '', 'Justification\/Explanation', ''], ['enilesaB', None, 'Emissions\\nassociated\\nwith the\\nproduction of\\nbaseline\\nreagents', 'CO\\n2', None, 'Yes', None, None, 'The emissions associated with Cl and NaOH\\n2\\n(Chlor-Alkali) production have been accounted as\\nthese are generally not found naturally and are to\\nbe produced in an industrial facility.

All the subcompartments had the legal right to harvest\nissued by local forest bureau before the implementation of the project activity. Before 2015, they\nwere all forests which the trees could be logged and sold once reached the cutting rotation age\nbased on a timber harvest plan. After 2015, they are all converted to protected forests.

The strata is usually\nbased on the tree species, age and canopy density, but it does not mean all these factors should\nbe considered for all projects, more strata means more workload and cost.

As suggested\nby the tool, it is assumed that the implementation of the project activity increases the SOC content of the\nlands from the pre-project level to the level that is equal to the steady-state SOC content under native\nvegetation. The increase in SOC content in the project scenario takes place at a constant rate over a period\nof 20 years from the year of planting. The project meets the applicability conditions of this tool in the area\nmanaged with Pine plantations:\n\u2022 the areas of land to which the tool is applied do not fall into wetland category, do not contain\norganic soils and are not subject to any of the land management practices and application of\ninputs listed in Tables 1 and 2 of the tool;\n\u2022 Since the land use prior to project start was grassland, only Table 2 applies. For the\ntemperate warm moist climate region corresponding to the project activity, none of the three\ncombinations included in Table 2 are applicable;\n\u2022 litter remains on site and is not removed and soil disturbance is in accordance with\nappropriate conservation practices, limited to site preparation and not repeated within 20\nyears.\nTable 19. Parameters used for estimation of SOC\nSOC at the beginning of the project (SOC ) is estimated by multiplying the factors in Table 19 by the INITIAL,i\nreference SOC. As per the tool, a loss in SOC (SOC ) is applied in the case that soil disturbance LOSS,i\noccurs on more than 10 per cent of the land area, which is the case of Weyerhaeuser Uruguay project.\nThe following methodological formula is used for calculating the annual change in SOC stock:\nSOC \u2212(SOC \u2212SOC )\ndSOC = REF,i INICIAL,i LOSS,i\nt,i 20\nv3.0 82"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

The Act consolidated the laws relating to generation,\ntransmission, distribution, trading and use of electricity. With the Enactment of the act, the then existing\nlaws viz, The Indian Electricity Act 1910, The Electricity Supply Act, 1948 and The Electricity\nRegulatory Commissions Act, 1998 were repealed. The Electricity Act 2003 was in force at the time of\nthe completion of the baseline study for the PDD.\nThe Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission (GERC), had issued a draft tariff order on Wind Energy\non the 17th of June 2009 1 wherein a tariff of Rs. 3.55\/kWh has been suggested and which has been used\nin the analysis.\nInvestment Analysis\nThe project activity involves setting up of 14.85 MW of wind power in Gujarat which will be supplied to\nthe state electricity grid. The benchmark analysis method has been selected to depict the investment\nanalysis as the project activity has a revenue source other than CDM revenue.\nThis is one of the first steps being undertaken by Powerica with the motive of being an independent wind\npower producer exporting the generated electricity from its wind farm to the regional electricity system\ni.e. NEWNE. Since the project involved 100% equity, Powerica consecutively sought an equity returns\nbased benchmark applicable to independent power producers in the country implementing similar\nprojects.\nAn investment analysis of the project activity was conducted with post tax equity Internal Rate of Return\n(IRR) as the financial indicator. IRR is one of the known financial indicators used by banks, lending\ninstitutions and project developers for decision making. The benchmark IRR for the project has been\nchosen as 14.76 %. The value has been arrived at following the Capital Asset Pricing Model.\nR = R + \u03b2 * (R \u2013 R) i f m f\nwhere,\n1 GERC Order\n13\n\n[['R\\nm', 'Risk Premium']]\n[['', 'Parameter', '', '', 'Value', '', '', 'Source of Data', ''], ['Capacity of the wind project', None, None, '14.85 MW', None, None, '', None, None], ['No. and capacity of machines', None, None, '9 Nos.

Torrent Power\n2. Tata Power\n3. Reliance Power\n4. BF Utilities\n5. GVK Power\n6. KSK Energy\n7. Surya Chakra\nThe minimum Beta value for this period is attributed to BF Utilities at 0.5969. However, it must be noted\nthat this had been a conservative approach taken by the project proponent as the average beta for all of\nthe above mentioned companies was 0.8544 for the same period.\nThe risk premium value has been arrived at by calculating the Compound Annual Growth Rate for the\nBSE-SENSEX since its base year (1978-79) on a base value of 100. At the time of decision making, the\nSENSEX had a low of 16498.59. Hence, the risk premium value is\n= R = {(16498.69\/100) ^ (1\/29) \u2013 1} = 19.25% m\nwherein, 29 years has been the gap between the base year and project start date.\nHence, R = 8.12 + 0.5969 * (19.25 \u2013 8.12) = 14.76% i\nThe following assumptions have been made for conducting the financial analysis:\n(Note: 1 Lakh INR= 100,000 INR)\n2 It must please be noted here that as per \u201cGuidelines for the reporting and validation of plant load factors\u201d Version\n01, a prior wind assessment study had been conducted by the project proponent, which states a generation value\nlower than that mentioned in the quote.

A detailed financial plan for managing the Makira project over the\nentire project period can be found in annex 6. Projections for expenses in this plan are based on the\nMakira management plan developed by WCS and approved by MEF in 2010, while expected\nrevenues are based on current negotiations with potential buyers and experience from previous sales.\nFirst sales of emission reduction carbon credits, marketed through the Conservation International\nCentre for Environmental and Leadership in Business, were approved by the Ministry of Environment,\nWater and Forests in early December 2004 and again in 2008 (cf section 1.12.3).\n1.7 Project Scale and Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals\nThe implementation of the project will generate an estimated 38,016,930 tons of CO equivalents in 2\nemission reductions (t CO -e) over the 30-year crediting period (cf. table 1). This corresponds to 2\nannual emissions reductions of 1,267,231 tons of CO equivalent per year and the Makira project can 2\ntherefore be considered as a VCS mega project (more than 1,000,000 t CO -e\/y emission reductions). 2\nIn order to account for non-permanence risks associated with the Makira AFOLU project and in\naccordance with the VCS permanence risk assessment tool, 13% of the estimated net change in the\nproject\u2019s carbon stocks (baseline stocks minus stocks in the project case) will be set aside in a risk\nbuffer account and not sold (cf. section 3.5 and annex 5). This amounts to a total set aside of\n5'517'948 tons of CO equivalents or an annual mean of 183,932 tons of CO equivalents. 2 2\nMakira Forest Protected Area Project; Project Description; version 9.0 16\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n1.8 Description of the Project Activities"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"2005\":0,\"2006\":68060,\"2007\":155842,\"2008\":229815,\"2009\":292979,\"2010\":430086,\"2011\":482533,\"2012\":529796,\"2013\":573003,\"2014\":613035,\"2015\":813211,\"2016\":848616,\"2017\":884021,\"2018\":919426,\"2019\":954831,\"2020\":1260397,\"2021\":1305157,\"2022\":1349917,\"2023\":1394677,\"2024\":1439436,\"2025\":1841432,\"2026\":1896736,\"2027\":1952040,\"2028\":2007344,\"2029\":2062648,\"2030\":2606631,\"2031\":2674505,\"2032\":2742378,\"2033\":2810251,\"2034\":2878124}"}]}

The start date is based on the acceptance date from the \u201cCompletion acceptance\nform of High-standard rice construction project in Yongchuan District\u201d. The construction of ditches, reservoirs, and valves was\ncarried out on the original land, and no more land was occupied.

As addressed in the PD, this is\ndue to the manner in which the Project is operated, such as: no vehicles, manual labor\nconducted by the small-hold farmers on their own land, restrictions on chemical fertilizers, no\nclearing of baseline trees and minimal disturbance of the ground for planting.\nProject Removal Calculations\nThe following provides the step-by-step procedure used to determine the Project GHG\nremovals:\nStep 1. Because of the difference in species and age of the trees and location, ownership\nand management of the project areas, each project area is monitored. They are\ndocumented in the \"PA Summary\" worksheet of Appendix 14. The location of each PA was\nobtained with a GPS and is also provided in the \"PA Summary\" worksheet of Appendix 14.\nThe boundary of each project area was obtained using a GPS and provided in PD Appendix\n03. The area was calculated and is listed with each project area in the \"PA Summary\"\nworksheet of Appendix 14.\nStep 2. The strata for the ex-post estimation of the actual net greenhouse gas removals was\ndone by species and year similar to the ex-ante estimate as described in PD Section 3.2.\nStratification was done within each individual project areas. The area of a stratum in a\nproject area (\"Area of a Stratum (ha)\") was determined by multiplying the area of project area\n(see Step 1) by the percentage of trees of that stratum in the respective project area. The\nresults are provided in the \"Ex-post Strata\" worksheet of Appendix 14.\nStep 3. Where a tree species exceeded 10% of the total tree inventory, it was assigned to a\nMajor Strata. All other tree species were assigned to an \"Other\" strata. Based on the\ntabulations in Appendix 14, there are four major strata: eucalyptus, grevillea, cypress and\nother.\nStep 4. Allometric equations were used to convert DBH values to biomass. An allometric\nequation for each Major Strata was identified. If a species specific equation for a Major\nStrata was unavailable, it used the \"Other\" equation as a default. Allometric equations were\nresearched and the most appropriate ones identified by the Proponent were assigned to the\nmajor strata. Because no better allometric equation could be found for grevillea and cypress,\nthey were assigned to the \"Other\" equation. The following is the assignment.\nEucalyptus13: Log Y = -2.43 + 2.58 Log C\n13 DH Ashton, \u201cThe Development of Even-aged Stands in Eucalyptus regnans F.

In the PD we stated \"the operational processes for monitoring\nthe actual GhG removal by the sinks are for TIST Quantifiers to visit each grove once per year\nand, at minimum, once every five years to count trees and collect circumference, GPS and other\ndata\" (Section 4.1.3). TIST Quantifiers are not visiting each PA (grove) once per year.\nQuantification Every Five Years: While counting trees and collecting circumference every five\nyears is a requirement of the methodology (and followed by the Project), visiting every PA every\nyear was simply an operational goal. Not making annual visits does not impact the applicability of\nthe methodology, additionality or the appropriateness of the baseline scenario. That it was an\noperational goal was clearly stated in Section 4.3.5, \"TIST\u2019s internal goal is to quantify each\nproject area once per year.\"\nThere are 17 PAs in this PD and over 6,000 PAs in TIST Uganda. Unfortunately, visiting every\nPA every year proved to be too costly to maintain. Instead the entire TIST program in Uganda\nwas modified and centered on a \"Cluster\" administrative structure. A Cluster is a group of Small\nGroups within walking distance that has their own local leadership. It is where Small Groups\nreceive training, voucher payment, share \"best practices,\" share news and newsletters and\ndiscuss quantification issues. A Quantifier is assigned to each Cluster and their scope has been\nbroadened to include training and assisting Cluster leaders as they rotate into new positions. The\nCluster provides an alternate method of gathering intelligence about what is happening at the\nSmall Group level and to individual groves including information that might assist in monitoring\nthe actual GhG removal.3 This allows us to get the same information that a Quantifier might get\non a non-quantification visit (i.e. the annual visit) by asking members and their neighbors about\nchanges, at a more sustainable cost. The ideal schedule for Cluster meetings is one per month,\nincreasing the frequency of opportunity to learn about changes at the grove level.\nRemoving Project Activity Instances: While it was expected that there would be loss of trees\nfrom the PD due to harvest, etc.,4 the loss of PAs was not addressed. When a member or Small\nGroup quits or harvests their trees, or if a PA is found to fall within one of the \u201cremove\u201d categories\nl through v in section 2.1, above, they are no longer active in the PD. The name of the grove is\n3 This includes examples such as if an SG or an SG member has quit or if there has been a major loss\nfrom fire, pest, harvest, etc. The type of information collected is reflected in the monitoring spreadsheets\nwhere we have indicated an issue with the project area (removed or pending) and zeroed out the carbon\nfor this verification.\n4 See section 4.3.3 of the PD: \u201csince ex post carbon calculations are based on current tree counts, any\ntrees lost to harvest, etc., are automatically excluded from the calculation\u201d\nv3.4 8\n\nMONITORING REPORT : VCS Version 3\nkept on the monitoring spreadsheet (Appendix 11), the reason for the removal is given in the\n\u201cStatus V3\u201d column of the \u201cPA Summary\u201d worksheet of Appendix 14, and the carbon sequestered\nfrom the PA is zeroed out. By zeroing the carbon, all of the carbon credits previously issued from\nthe PA are replaced with growth from the existing trees in the PD."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

The manure treatment system does not\nemit GHG into the atmosphere when the project is installed (with the considerations of B.3).\nTherefore the annual methane emissions are reduced to 0 t CO e due to the capture and disposal of methane released 2\nfrom stored manure and agricultural wastes.\n2. Replacement of fossil fuels for heating (AMS-I.C Thermal Energy for the user)\nNo additional GHG emissions do occur by sources in the project scenario. The heat demand is completely covered\nby the waste heat of the biogas power plant, and no fossil energy is burned any more. Thus no GHG is emitted into\nthe atmosphere when the project is installed (with the considerations of B.3).\nTherefore the annual methane emissions are reduced to 0 t CO e due to the replacement of fossil fuels for thermal 2\npurposes such as heating.\n3. Total project activity emissions\nThe total GHG emissions caused by the project activity is zero.\nThe net GHG mitigation from the electricity approach (production amount minus operating demand) is neutralized in\norder to avoid conflicts with the Act of March 2006 amending the Environmental Management Act to implement the\nEU linking directive).\nThe net power balance is very positive, as the electricity production of the biogas power plant is much higher than\nthe parasitic load of the power plant internal consumers and also much higher than the electricity consumption to be\ncovered from the grid in case of non-operation."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

As addressed in the PD, this is\ndue to the manner in which the Project is operated, such as: no vehicles, manual labor\nconducted by the small-hold farmers on their own land, restrictions on chemical fertilizers, no\nclearing of baseline trees and minimal disturbance of the ground for planting.\nProject Removal Calculations\nThe following provides the step-by-step procedure used to determine the Project GHG\nremovals:\nStep 1. Because of the difference in species and age of the trees and location, ownership\nand management of the project areas, each project area is monitored. They are\ndocumented in the \"PA Summary\" worksheet of Appendix 14. The location of each PA was\nobtained with a GPS and is also provided in the \"PA Summary\" worksheet of Appendix 14.\nThe boundary of each project area was obtained using a GPS and provided in PD Appendix\n03. The area was calculated and is listed with each project area in the \"PA Summary\"\nworksheet of Appendix 14.\nStep 2. The strata for the ex-post estimation of the actual net greenhouse gas removals was\ndone by species and year similar to the ex-ante estimate as described in PD Section 3.2.\nStratification was done within each individual project areas. The area of a stratum in a\nproject area (\"Area of a Stratum (ha)\") was determined by multiplying the area of project area\n(see Step 1) by the percentage of trees of that stratum in the respective project area. The\nresults are provided in the \"Ex-post Strata\" worksheet of Appendix 14.\nStep 3. Where a tree species exceeded 10% of the total tree inventory, it was assigned to a\nMajor Strata. All other tree species were assigned to an \"Other\" strata. Based on the\ntabulations in Appendix 14, there are four major strata: eucalyptus, grevillea, cypress and\nother.\nStep 4. Allometric equations were used to convert DBH values to biomass. An allometric\nequation for each Major Strata was identified. If a species specific equation for a Major\nStrata was unavailable, it used the \"Other\" equation as a default. Allometric equations were\nresearched and the most appropriate ones identified by the Proponent were assigned to the\nmajor strata. Because no better allometric equation could be found for grevillea and cypress,\nthey were assigned to the \"Other\" equation. The following is the assignment.\nEucalyptus13: Log Y = -2.43 + 2.58 Log C\n13 DH Ashton, \u201cThe Development of Even-aged Stands in Eucalyptus regnans F.

However, certain foreseen impacts due to the project\nactivity are discussed below:\nNoise Pollution\nMost of the wind turbines are in isolated areas or on designated wind zones\nand hence do not cause any concern to the residents of the area. In the same\nvein, construction activities also have not caused noise pollution due to the\nisolated nature of the area.\nWater Pollution\nThere is no gaseous, liquid or solid effluent from the Wind Turbine\nGenerators. Hence there is no contamination of water bodies due to\noperation of Wind Turbine Generators.\nAir Pollution\nMinimal air pollution might have occurred during the construction of the\nProject due to transportation. However, these were not found to affect the\nsurrounding persons nor the environment in any significant manner. Wind\n9 Source: http:\/\/envfor.nic.in\/legis\/eia\/eianot.pdf\n34\n\n[['', 'Sr No.', '', '', 'Event', '', '', 'Date', '']]\nenergy plants are known to contribute to zero atmospheric pollution as no\nfuel combustion is involved during any stage of the operation.\nHence it can be concluded that there are no negative impacts associated\nwith the mentioned Project.\n5 Environmental Impact:\nThe project activity is a clean energy project using renewable source of\nenergy, wind, to generate power. It has already received permission from\nMaharashtra Energy Development Agency (MEDA) which is a department\nof the State Government of Maharashtra.\nThe project activity is exempted from carrying out any EIA as per the\nnotification S.O.1533 dated 14\/09\/2006 of Ministry of Environment and\nForests, Government of India.\n6 Stakeholders comments:\nA stakeholder consultation meeting was organized for this project activity.\nThe copy of the public notice inviting stakeholders to the meeting, copy of\nthe attendance sheet and copy of Minutes of Stakeholder Consultation are\nattached in Annexure 3.\nThere were no specific negative comments. The apprehensions of the\nstakeholders were cleared to satisfaction. Since there were no negative\ncomments, there were no changes to the Project.\nMaharashtra Energy Development Agency (State Government of\nMaharashtra Undertaking) has also given their infrastructure clearance for\nsetting up the project activity.\n7 Schedule:\n35\n\n[['1', 'SEL appointed as equipment supplier and O&M contractor', '14-Oct-05'], ['2', 'Commissioning of WTG', '30-Sep-06'], ['3', 'Frequency of monitoring generation and supply to grid', 'Monthly'], ['4', 'Calibration of meters', 'Annual'], ['5', 'Verification of emission reduction', 'Bi-annual'], ['6', 'Project crediting period', '30-Sep-2006 to\\n29-Sep-2016']]\n8 Ownership:"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"2007\":906,\"2008\":906,\"2009\":906,\"2010\":906,\"2011\":906,\"2012\":906,\"2013\":906,\"2014\":906,\"2015\":906,\"2016\":906}"}]}

No\ndislocation of people or wildlife will occur as a result of the project activity.\nThere are no federal authorizations or permits required for the project that would\nentail consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, to include the\nneed to obtain project authorization from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. There\nare four federally listed endangered or threatened species that potentially occur in\nthe general vicinity of the Red Hills Wind Project: the interior least tern, whooping\ncrane, piping plover, and the Arkansas River shiner. The project activity has been\ndesigned to avoid impacts on the United States waterways.\nAcciona Wind Energy USA LLC voluntarily contracted HDR Engineering, Inc.\n(HDR) and Western Ecosystems Technology Inc. to complete the environmental\nsite assessment (ESA) and Biological Assessment of the property proposed for the\nRed Hills Wind Project. The environmental assessment was completed by HDR on\nJanuary 30, 2008 and the biological assessment was completed by Western\nEcosystems on March 27, 2008.\nWestern Ecosystems determined that; \u201cThe Red Hills project avoids many of the\npotential impacts to whooping cranes due to its distal proximity to the main\nmigratory flyway.\u201d Western Ecosystems also determined that other aforementioned\nendangered species were not threatened by the project activity.\nAcciona voluntarily contracted Western Ecosystems to conduct a voluntary bat\nassessment using acoustic monitoring equipment. Additionally post construction\nbat mortality monitoring will take place for one year after operation of the facility\nbegins. Any bats that are found during these mortality studies will be offered as a\ndonation to the American Museum of Natural History for their ongoing Genomic\nStudies.\nFurther studies such as the wetlands delineation was conducted on November 26\nand 27, 2007, by two HDR biologists. The survey was conducted in accordance\nwith the Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual (Environmental\nLaboratory, 1987).\nAcciona proposes to implement the following design, siting, and conservation\nmeasures to ensure to that the ecological environment is not affected by the project\nactivity:\n\u2022 Turbine Design: Acciona will use monopole, tubular designs that\neliminate avian perching sites. Guy wires will not be used on\nturbines. If guy wires are used on the permanent and temporary\nmeteorological towers within the project, appropriate high visibility\nmarkings will be used.\n\u2022 Collector Line Design: Acciona will bury the majority (about 88%) of\nthe collector lines for the project. For the overhead collector line\n41\n\nProprietary and Confidential\nsegments and the overhead 138 kV transmission line, Acciona will\nmark the lines in accordance with methods recommended by the\nAvian Power Line Committee (APLIC).\n\u2022 Transmission Line: Using guidance from APLIC\u2019s Suggested\nPractices for Avian Protection on Power Lines, approximately 4 miles\nof on-site overhead 138 kV transmission line will be designed to\nminimize the potential for bird electrocutions.\n\u2022 Lighting: The Red Hills Wind Project will use the minimum amount\nof lighting as required by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\nLighting is anticipated to be pulsating red light on the minimum\nnumber of turbines as required by the FAA in order to reduce the\ndisturbances on the local population.\n\u2022 Air Impacts: Wind Power plants do not contribute to atmospheric\npollution as no fuel combustion is involved during any stage of the\noperation. The primary emissions source for the project will be motor\nvehicle exhaust resulting from construction and maintenance of the\nproject. However, in light of the project activity and the resulting\nemission reductions, motor vehicle emissions will be a very minor\nemissions source.\n\u2022 Noise Impacts: Personal protective equipment is provided to workers\ninvolved in construction activity to mitigate the effects of noise\npollution. Taking into consideration the project life cycle, the\nmagnitude of the impacts during the construction phase are negligible\nand exists for a temporary period of time until the end of construction\nphase. Therefore, noise pollution will also be a very minor issue and\nwill not harm the environment.\nAcciona recognizes the concerns over the relationship between wind energy\ndevelopment and the ecological environment of the project activity. As such,\ncommitments have been made to evaluate and immediately address issues that\nimpact the project activity area.\n42\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n6 Stakeholders\u2019 comments:\nStakeholders for the Red Hills Wind Farm project include landowners, local\nresidents, local officials, and Acciona staff.\nRoger Mills County held public meetings on February 11th and June 16th 2008 to\ndiscuss permitting issues for the Red Hills Wind Farm. During these meetings,\nlocal constituents were provided the opportunity and platform to discuss their\nconcerns about the project activity.\nEach meeting began with a brief progress update for the project activity by the\nproject developer, construction manager, and other project officials. The overall\nreaction can be summarized as positive. The local residents expressed satisfaction\nthat the project activity has created local employment which is improving the\nstandard of life as well as socio-economic conditions of the surrounding area.\nMoreover, local landowners have expressed satisfaction that the project activity has\nled to an increase in land values.\nOnly one negative issue was raised by one non-participating landowner at the\nFebruary 11th meeting. This landowner raised concerns that the turbines were too\nclose to the fence surrounding his property, which is not in the project activity\narea. This concern was investigated by the project developer and it was discovered\nthat the landowner had mistaken a property survey stake that was about 30 feet\nfrom his fence for a turbine-staked location. This issue was resolved through\nfurther communication with the landowner and was publicly addressed at the June\n16th community meeting.\nIn July 2008, two non-participating landowners from Roger Mills County requested\nto meet with the project developer to express concerns that the project activity was\nlocated too close to their property lines. The landowners expressed that they felt\nthat permitting had occurred without their knowledge and felt that they had been\ncircumvented in the process. Over the course of a two-hour meeting, it was pointed\nout that Acciona had followed the counties permitting guidance and that there were\ntwo public meetings that they did not attend.\nThese landowners as well as all stakeholders involved in this project activity will be\nnotified of all future public meetings.\n43\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n7 Schedule:\nThe Red Hills crediting period will begin on the commercial operation date of\nOctober 26, 2008 and will last for 10 years thereafter. The lifespan of the wind\nfarm is expected to be 20 years after the operational date. The project activity will\nnot be terminated for any reason, other than for emergencies, until the end of the\noperational life. Validation will be complete upon review and approval of this\ndocument. Verification will occur depending on the needs of project participants.\n44\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n8 Ownership:"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"2009\":293839,\"2010\":293839,\"2011\":293839,\"2012\":293839,\"2013\":293839,\"2014\":293839,\"2015\":293839,\"2016\":293839,\"2017\":293839,\"2018\":293839}"}]}

As\ndemonstrated above in Section 2.5, the baseline scenario is the one involving\nlimited encroachment maintenance at a steady state. This baseline scenario\nrepresents the carbon stocks in living trees at the start of the project activity\ncalculated according to the methodology with the formula:\n61\n\n[['Table 4.2.1 Estimation of the ex ante baseline net GHG removals by sinks.', None], ['', None], ['Year', 'Annual estimation of cumulative baseline net\\nanthropogenic GHG removals by sinks; in t CO -\\n2\\ne'], ['1995', '164.175'], ['1996', '164.175'], ['1997', '164.175'], ['1998', '164.175'], ['1999', '164.175'], ['2000', '164.175'], ['2001', '164.175'], ['2002', '164.175'], ['2003', '164.175'], ['2004', '164.175'], ['2005', '164.175'], ['2006', '164.175'], ['2007', '164.175'], ['2008', '164.175'], ['2009', '164.175'], ['2010', '164.175'], ['2011', '164.175'], ['2012', '164.175'], ['2013', '164.175'], ['2014', '164.175'], ['2015', '164.175']]\nVCS Project Description Template\nFor this ARR project activity, Face in 1999 commissioned Meijer to carry out a\nbaseline study whose results show that changes in the carbon stocks for both\nabove and below ground biomass are expected not to exceed actual net GHG\nremovals by sinks and are therefore assumed to be zero in the absence of the\nproject activity. Hence the formula above is only applied to multiply the 5.2 tonnes\nof carbon per hectare (adjusted from Meijer, 1999), which is the conservative\nvalue of the carbon stock in the stratum \u2018banana plantation\u2019, with the combined\narea A of stratum \u2018Planted Area\u2019 and \u2018Regenerating Area\u2019. The total area to be i\nplanted during the crediting period is presented in Table 7.2 and has a size of\n6,000 hectares. In addition, the Regenerating Area is 2,593 hectares. The\ncombined area is therefore 8,593 hectares. As the baseline is in a steady state,\nthere is no increases in GHG removals. See Annex III for details on the estimation,\nand the spreadsheet \u00b4 Kibale Baseline Recalculation_082711 \u00b4, which details the\ncalculation of the mean tree carbon stock in the baseline, based on inventory data\nby Meijer in 1999. In addition, the carbon stock changes in dead wood, litter and\nsoil organic matter are conservatively assumed to be zero based on the\nmethodology applied.\n62\n\n[['2016', '164.175'], ['2017', '164.175'], ['2018', '164.175'], ['2019', '164.175'], ['2020', '164.175'], ['2021', '164.175'], ['2022', '164.175'], ['2023', '164.175'], ['2024', '164.175'], ['2025', '164.175'], ['2026', '164.175'], ['2027', '164.175'], ['2028', '164.175'], ['2029', '164.175'], ['2030', '164.175'], ['2031', '164.175'], ['2032', '164.175'], ['2033', '164.175'], ['2034', '164.175'], ['2035', '164.175'], ['2036', '164.175'], ['2037', '164.175'], ['2038', '164.175'], ['2039', '164.175'], ['2040', '164.175'], ['2041', '164.175'], ['2042', '164.175'], ['2043', '164.175'], ['2044', '164.175'], ['2045', '164.175'], ['2046', '164.175'], ['2047', '164.175'], ['2048', '164.175'], ['2049', '164.175'], ['2050', '164.175'], ['2051', '164.175'], ['2052', '164.175'], ['2053', '164.175'], ['2054', '164.175'], ['2055', '164.175'], ['2056', '164.175']]\nVCS Project Description Template\n63\n\n[['2057', '164.175'], ['2058', '164.175'], ['2059', '164.175'], ['2060', '164.175'], ['2061', '164.175'], ['2062', '164.175'], ['2063', '164.175'], ['2064', '164.175'], ['2065', '164.175'], ['2066', '164.175'], ['2067', '164.175'], ['2068', '164.175'], ['Total estimated baseline net GHG\\nremovals by sinks (tonnes of CO2 e)', '164.175'], ['Total number of crediting years', '60']]\nVCS Project Description Template"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"1995\":164.175,\"1996\":164.175,\"1997\":164.175,\"1998\":164.175,\"1999\":164.175,\"2000\":164.175,\"2001\":164.175,\"2002\":164.175,\"2003\":164.175,\"2004\":164.175,\"2005\":164.175,\"2006\":164.175,\"2007\":164.175,\"2008\":164.175,\"2009\":164.175,\"2010\":164.175,\"2011\":164.175,\"2012\":164.175,\"2013\":164.175,\"2014\":164.175,\"2015\":164.175,\"2016\":164.175,\"2017\":164.175,\"2018\":164.175,\"2019\":164.175,\"2020\":164.175,\"2021\":164.175,\"2022\":164.175,\"2023\":164.175,\"2024\":164.175,\"2025\":164.175,\"2026\":164.175,\"2027\":164.175,\"2028\":164.175,\"2029\":164.175,\"2030\":164.175,\"2031\":164.175,\"2032\":164.175,\"2033\":164.175,\"2034\":164.175,\"2035\":164.175,\"2036\":164.175,\"2037\":164.175,\"2038\":164.175,\"2039\":164.175,\"2040\":164.175,\"2041\":164.175,\"2042\":164.175,\"2043\":164.175,\"2044\":164.175,\"2045\":164.175,\"2046\":164.175,\"2047\":164.175,\"2048\":164.175,\"2049\":164.175,\"2050\":164.175,\"2051\":164.175,\"2052\":164.175,\"2053\":164.175,\"2054\":164.175,\"2055\":164.175,\"2056\":164.175,\"2057\":164.175,\"2058\":164.175,\"2059\":164.175,\"2060\":164.175,\"2061\":164.175,\"2062\":164.175,\"2063\":164.175,\"2064\":164.175,\"2065\":164.175,\"2066\":164.175,\"2067\":164.175,\"2068\":164.175}"}]}

Thus, we used our theory of\nchange logic in the Result Chain diagrams (section Error! Reference source not found.) as the basis\nfor selecting indicators that factor in attribution. We then decided on the best sampling methods to use\nto collect these data to acceptable levels accuracy, precision and cost effectiveness whilst retaining\ntransparency and simplicity. From this, a Monitoring Plan was developed to guide data collection.\nFurther, the indicators will be analyzed based on the Pressure-State-Response framework, which also\nrelies on a causal-chain logic, where threats negatively impact the status\/condition of biodiversity, while\n87\n\nProject Description: SD VISta Version 1\nresponses or project interventions reduce pressure. Most Response indicators can be grouped under:\nHabitat improvement; Security enhancement; and Improvement of community livelihoods efforts.\nPressure indicators fall under: Human population size and dynamics; Human-wildlife conflict (HWC);\nand Incidences including poaching, grazing, encroachment, charcoal and firewood collection amongst\nothers. Finally, State indicators are grouped into three categories: wildlife (including species presence,\ndiversity, distribution and movement); vegetation and land-use (including changes in various\nvegetation\/habitat types, encroachment and fire). Most of the response and pressure indicators\ncorrespond to the social indicators developed in the community monitoring plan (See Section. 4.3.1),\nand so data collection follows the protocols outlined therein. On top, we determined 12 indicators not\npart of the social indicator set, also classified into three categories: Output 4; Outcome 4; and Impact.\nFor these new indicators, two main strategies will be used to obtain the data: In-house reporting and\nGovernment records, mostly for output and outcome indicators, and surveys for most impact indicators.\nWe envision three main aspects of state indicators to measure, each with a distinct set of monitoring\nprotocols:\nWildlife: wildlife surveys and monitoring for all species \u2013 with a focus on HCVs \u2013 will be done using\nseveral methods: ranger patrols, camera traps, fecal-DNA analysis, and information from any\nindependent research projects in the area\nVegetation and Land-use: carbon plot monitoring plots and remote sensing (based on LANDSAT\nimagery) and GIS techniques.\n88\n\n[['Focal Issue', 'Key results', 'SMART\\nObjective', None, None, 'Indicato\\nr Code', 'Indicator', None, None, 'Indicator\\ntype', '', 'Data', '', 'Who?', 'When?', 'Where\\n?'], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'collection', None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'method', None, None, None, None], ['Forest\\ndestruction\\nand land\\nencroachmen\\nt', 'Decrease in\\nillegal logging', '', 'By 2027,', '', '', 'Seven\\nindicators\\nincluded in\\nthe SIA\\nMonitoring\\nPlan', None, None, '', '', None, None, '', '', ''], [None, None, None, 'reduce the', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'number of', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'illegal', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'logging', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'incidents by', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'half in the', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'SCRP', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['', 'Decrease in\\nencroachmen\\nt and land-\\ngrabbing', '', 'By 2022,', '', '', 'Eight related\\nindicators\\nincluded in\\nthe SIA\\nMonitoring\\nPlan', None, None, '', '', None, None, '', '', ''], [None, None, None, 'two CPA', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'are created,', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'registered at', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'MoE and', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'their NTFPs', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'can access', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'markets', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['', '', '', None, None, 'BIA003', '', '# and types', '', 'Impact', 'CPA\\nrecords', None, None, 'Communit\\ny outreach', 'Annuall\\ny', 'Project\\nZone'], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'of NTFPs', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'sold in', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'markets', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['', '', '', None, None, 'BIA004', '', 'Amount of', '', 'Impact', 'CPA\\nrecords', None, None, 'Communit\\ny outreach', 'Annuall\\ny', 'Project\\nZone'], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'revenue', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'accruing', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'from NTFP', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'sales from', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'the area', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]]\n[['SMART'], ['Objective']]\n[['Seven'], ['indicators'], ['included in'], ['the SIA'], ['Monitoring'], ['Plan']]\n[['Forest'], ['destruction'], ['and land'], ['encroachmen'], ['t']]\n[['Decrease in'], ['illegal logging']]\n[['Eight related'], ['indicators'], ['included in'], ['the SIA'], ['Monitoring'], ['Plan']]\n[['Decrease in'], ['encroachmen'], ['t and land-'], ['grabbing']]\n[['CPA'], ['records']]\n[['CPA'], ['records']]\nProject Description: SD VISta Version 1\nBiodiversity Impact Assessment: Monitoring Plan\nTable 9: Project biodiversity impact assessment for monitoring plan.\n89"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

However, in the framework of the VCS, relevant\ngreenhouse gas emissions of the baseline scenario shall be considered (VCS 2007.1, paragraph 6.3.1).\nThe baseline studies made by CIRAD (200040; 200141) first described the activities present in the\nreference scenario and the project scenario (Table 9) within project boundary, and then listed all GHG\nsources related to the activities approached (Table 10).\nTable 9: Activities of reference scenario and project scenario.\nTable 10: Carbon pools and GHG sources of reference scenario and project scenario.\nEmissions from combustion of fossil fuel\nThe combustion of fossil fuels occurs in both reference and project scenario but the related GHG\nemissions are supposed to be higher in the project scenario because of additional activities (reforestation\nactivities). However, they should be very low and negligible in comparison with CO removals from 2\nforest plantations.\nThe GHG emissions were calculated by following IPCC GL 2006 with the date monitored in the fazenda.\nEvery year, 2\u2019000 liters of diesel oil are consumed by project activities. Depending on years, a trade-off\nexists between activities but global consumption remains similar. By applying IPCC method and default\nvalues (EF = 2.707 kgCO .L-1), a total of 54.14 tCO were emitted during the last 10 years, since Diesel oil 2 2\nproject start. If this result is compared to the GHG emissions from fossil fuel combustion of the reference\nscenario, the net GHG emissions can reasonably be neglected.\nEmissions from biomass burning\n40 Locatelli, B., 2000.

Fire is used each year in order to stimulate growth of grasses. In terms\nof greenhouse gas, CO , CH , CO, NO and N O are emitted. While CO emissions are compensated by 2 4 x 2 2\nthe regrowth of grasses, the other GHG emissions remain in the atmosphere, representing a GHG source.\nIn the project scenario such practice is not used as pastures are converted to forest lands. Thus, GHG\nemissions from biomass burning in the reference scenario are net GHG emissions, but if accidental fires\noccur in the project area. Therefore GHG emissions from biomass burning could represent a relevant\nGHG source.\nHowever, such emissions need large amount of biomass burning to be significant. As an example CH is 4\nthe main GHG released during biomass burning with an emission factor of 67 g.(kg d.m)-1, in comparison\nwith other GHG that have emissions factors lower than 4 g.(kg d.m)-1. Considering a hypothetical initial\nbiomass of 30 t d.m.ha-1 in pasture of the project area, which is high, the CH released during biomass 4\nburning of the whole project area would be 16 tCO -e each year. Therefore, as GHG emissions from 2\nfossil fuel combustion, GHG emissions from biomass burning can reasonably be neglected.\nEmissions from enteric fermentation\nThis item represents the major GHG source inside project in the baseline scenario. As mentioned above,\n3\u2019960 heads of cattle pre-existed before project start and then were killed at project start. Thus, the\ndifference between GHG emissions from enteric fermentation in the reference scenario shall be\nsignificant compared with project scenario.\nHowever, in the project scenario, some animals of neighboring fazendas are present inside project area.\nThe neighboring animals are authorized inside project area for weed control and to generate additional\nincomes from land renting. Thus, some cattle are still present inside project area with a low mean annual\npresence of 822 heads since project start.\nTherefore, even with animals still present inside project area, the difference of GHG emissions from\nenteric fermentation between reference scenario and project scenario will be significant, as a\nbuffalo emits more than 1 tCO -e.year-1, and therefore will be estimated following IPCC GL 2006 in 2\naccordance with VCS recommendations.\nEmissions from the decomposition of dead wood\nDead wood is a main compartment in the reference scenario and the project scenario as natural forest was\nslashed and burnt by the former landowner in order to open pastures for cattle grazing activities, and the\nlying dead wood left on site.\nIn the reference scenario, dead wood is burnt year after year through pasture management by fire. The\nremaining burnt dead wood participates to the process of decomposition. In the project scenario the dead\nwood is neither displaced nor burnt. Therefore, it completely participates to the process of decomposition.\nIn consequence, it can reasonably be argued that GHG emissions from dead wood burning in the\nreference scenario are almost equivalent to GHG emissions from dead wood decomposition in the project\nscenario considering that CH is the main GHG involved in both processes. 4\nMoreover, the inputs of dead wood from the management of forest plantations shall not lead to significant\nadditional GHG emissions considering the low amounts of GHG released during decomposition of dead\n\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-AR-PDD) - Version 02\n____________________________________________________________________________________\nC DM \u2013 Executive Board\nPage 57\nwood, as during biomass burning.

As addressed in the PD, this is\ndue to the manner in which the Project is operated, such as: no vehicles, manual labor\nconducted by the small-hold farmers on their own land, restrictions on chemical fertilizers, no\nclearing of baseline trees and minimal disturbance of the ground for planting.\nProject Removal Calculations\nThe following provides the step-by-step procedure used to determine the Project GHG\nremovals:\nStep 1. Because of the difference in species and age of the trees and location, ownership\nand management of the project areas, each project area is monitored. They are\ndocumented in the \"PA Summary\" worksheet of Appendix 14. The location of each PA was\nobtained with a GPS and is also provided in the \"PA Summary\" worksheet of Appendix 14.\nThe boundary of each project area was obtained using a GPS and provided in PD Appendix\n03. The area was calculated and is listed with each project area in the \"PA Summary\"\nworksheet of Appendix 14.\nStep 2. The strata for the ex-post estimation of the actual net greenhouse gas removals was\ndone by species and year similar to the ex-ante estimate as described in PD Section 3.2.\nStratification was done within each individual project areas. The area of a stratum in a\nproject area (\"Area of a Stratum (ha)\") was determined by multiplying the area of project area\n(see Step 1) by the percentage of trees of that stratum in the respective project area. The\nresults are provided in the \"Ex-post Strata\" worksheet of Appendix 14.\nStep 3. Where a tree species exceeded 10% of the total tree inventory, it was assigned to a\nMajor Strata. All other tree species were assigned to an \"Other\" strata. Based on the\ntabulations in Appendix 14, there are four major strata: eucalyptus, grevillea, cypress and\nother.\nStep 4. Allometric equations were used to convert DBH values to biomass. An allometric\nequation for each Major Strata was identified. If a species specific equation for a Major\nStrata was unavailable, it used the \"Other\" equation as a default. Allometric equations were\nresearched and the most appropriate ones identified by the Proponent were assigned to the\nmajor strata. Because no better allometric equation could be found for grevillea and cypress,\nthey were assigned to the \"Other\" equation. The following is the assignment.\nEucalyptus13: Log Y = -2.43 + 2.58 Log C\n13 DH Ashton, \u201cThe Development of Even-aged Stands in Eucalyptus regnans F.
