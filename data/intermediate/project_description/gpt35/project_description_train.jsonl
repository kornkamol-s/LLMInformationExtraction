The project activity is designed to construction the cement ditch and reservoir to realize the reducing of methane emissions by conducting intermittently flooded method instead of continuously flooded method during the cropping season in Central of Linxiang City.\\r\\nIn the baseline scenario, farmers in Linxiang District use continuously flooded method in rice paddies with the straw on field as the organic amendment inputs, which means fields have standing water throughout the rice growing season and only dry out for harvest. However, the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane because of anaerobic decomposition. In the project scenario, farmers in Linxiang District changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation. By controlled the irrigation and drainage according to the needs of rice growth, can save water resources. On the other hand, multiple aeration during rice cultivation can effectively reduce methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions.', 'project_state_province': 'Hunan Province', 'project_country': 'China', 'project_latitude': 29.36, 'project_longitude': 113.33}"}]}

A total of 8,521 households (36,214 farmers) were involved in the project. Without the project, local villagers would not have access to intermittently flooded technology and intact facilities to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously flooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Due to the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in the paddy soil under flooded conditions, a large amount of methane can be released, so the intermittently flooded method is more conducive to water efficiency, improving rice yield and reducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.\\r\\nThe implementation activities of the project include promoting intermittently flooded technology, technical training for the farmers, facility repair and replacement, etc. According to the needs of rice growth, farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in the rainy season.\\r\\nThe project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions by 385,462 tCO2e in the first seven-year period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 55,066 tCO2e.

The biogas power plant is owned by Liziz Biogas Sdn Bhd as a subsidiary of Mestron Holdings Berhad, with technical guidance from True Eco Sdn Bhd and carbon strategy provided by CarbonTrace Sdn Bhd. The purpose of the Project is to recover biogas produced during the POME treatment process, which, if not recovered, would be released into the atmosphere, thereby contributing to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The biogas power plant utilizes POME from Liziz Plantation Sdn. Bhd.'s palm oil mill as its feedstock. The proposed project activity includes the installation of an anaerobic wastewater treatment facility that employs Complete Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) biogas reactor technology. The biogas recovered is expected to be used for:  a. electricity generation for own consumption, and b. electricity generation to the national grid, with the option of flaring for any excess quantity generated. GHG emission reductions are achieved by capturing biogas from POME treatment, which prevents its release into the atmosphere and substitutes grid electricity with renewable energy. Prior to the project's implementation, the baseline POME treatment method would involve a series of cascading open lagoon ponds, and electricity needs were met through conventional means, which involved consuming non-renewable energy sources or energy from the national grid, primarily dependent on fossil fuels. Thus, the baseline scenario represented a significant environmental impact due to GHG releases and reliance on non-renewable energy sources. The methodology used in this Project is AMS-I.D: Grid connected renewable electricity generation, and is expected to reduce 10249.20 tCO2e annually or total of 71744.40 tCO2e during the 7-years of the first crediting period.\", 'project_state_province': 'Kelantan', 'project_country': 'Malaysia', 'project_latitude': 4.87, 'project_longitude': 101.81}"}]}

To reduce the increase of GHG emission\ndue to displacement of pre-project agricultural activities, PP has a strong policy for leakage\nmanagement: Part of the farmers are employed by PP, a system of intercropping is developed\nwhere intercroppers have legalised access to land and can benefit from prepared soils and plant\npermitted crops around the planted trees. This intercropping is possible until canopy closure.\nSince the PP plants new areas every year, intercroppers can also rotate together with the\nplanting years. In addition, the likelihood of leakage occurring due to people moving outside of the\nproject area is limited, as most of the land outside the project area is already at a very low\nbaseline.

Such benefits are, for example, accrued out during maintenance\noperations of the project activity or as generation of permanent labor in the form of\nsecurity services. The infrastructure in and around the project area has also been\nimproved due to project activities. This includes development of road network and\nimprovement of electricity quality, frequency and availability.\n\u2713 Economic Prosperity\nThe project activity leads to an investment of about INR 522 million to a developing region\nwhich otherwise would not have happened in the absence of project activity. The\ngenerated electricity is fed into the Unified Indian Grid through local grid, thereby\nimproving the grid frequency and availability of electricity to the local consumers\n(villagers & sub-urban habitants). This attracts new opportunities for industries and\neconomic activities to be setup in the area thereby resulting in greater local employment,\nultimately leading to overall development. The project activity also leads to diversification\nof the national energy supply, which is dominated by conventional fuel based generating\nunits.\n\u2713 Environmental Well-being\nThe project utilizes wind energy for generating electricity which otherwise would have\nbeen generated through alternate fuels (most likely- fossil fuel) based power plants,\ncontributing to reduction in specific emissions (emissions of pollutant) including GHG\nemissions. Being a renewable resource, using wind energy to generate electricity\ncontributes to resource conservation. Thus the project causes no negative impact on the\nsurrounding environment contributing to environmental well-being.\n\u2713 Technological Up-gradation\nThe project activity involves the installation of state-of\u2013art technology. The wind turbine\ngenerators used for the project activity are of the latest technology. This project therefore\nmotivates other proponents in the surrounding area to put up high-efficiency techniques.\nThus, it is ensured that the project activity meets all the criteria for Sustainable\ndevelopment.\n12\n\nJoint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.0\nFurther Information\nThere is no additional relevant legislative, technical, economic, sectoral, social, environmental,\ngeographic, site-specific and\/or temporal information that may have a bearing on the eligibility\nof the project, the net GHG emission reductions or removals, or the quantification of the project\u2019s\nnet GHG emission reductions or removals.\n2 SAFEGUARDS\n2.1 No Net Harm\nAccording to Indian regulation, the implementation of the wind park does not require an\nenvironmental impact assessment.

When the wind blades rotate, the connected generator also rotates, thereby\nproducing electricity.\nThe project activity has 5 WTGs each of 850 kW and 12 WTGs each of 250 kW.\nTechnology of 850 kW wind turbine generator\nThe 850 kW WTGs are of PAWT technology with Gamesa make turbines. These are an advanced version\nover conventional low capacity WTGs. The towers of these WTGs are 65 metres height. The higher\nheight gives the advantage of capturing higher power at higher height. This height also avoids disturbance\nfrom windmills located nearby. These turbines have state of art technology of variable speed and variable\npitch with a double fed generator. The \u2018aerofoil\u2019 design of the blade, especially 58 metres rotor, as against\nconventional 48-50 metres contributes to a larger swept area for energy capture. The design of the blade\nis suitable for low and medium wind conditions in plain and complex terrain, which suits the region\nwhere wind farms are located. The WTG reaches the rated capacity of 850 kW at 10.5 meters itself as\nagainst 12 metres as per power curve.\nTechnology of 250 kW wind turbine generator\nThe 250 kW WTGs installed in the project activity are of Wincon, Denmark technology and are\nmanufactured by Pioneer Wincon in India. These WTGs are of well established technology with very\nlittle maintenance. These WTGs are robust in construction and has a few moving parts as a fixed blade\nconfiguration.\nThe important parts of windmill are:\ni. Main Tower\nii. Blades\niii. Nacelle\niv. Hub\nv. Main shaft\nvi. Gearbox, bearing and housing\nvii. Brake\nviii. Generator\ni. Main Tower\n\nCDM-SSC-PDD (version 02)\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board page 8\nThis is a very tall structure of 65 metres height for 850 kW turbines and of 45 meters high for 250 kW\nturbines with a door and inside ladder at the bottom. The door is used to enter into the tower for operation\nand maintenance.\nii. Blades\nThe WTGs are provided with three blades. The blades are self supporting in nature made up of Fibre\nReinforced Polyester. The blades are mounted on the hub.\niii. Nacelle\nThe Nacelle is the one which contains all the major parts of a WTG. The nacelle is made up of thick\nrugged steel and mounted on a heavy slewing ring. Under normal operating conditions the nacelle would\nbe facing the upstream wind direction.\niv.Hub\nThe Hub is an intermediate assembly between the wing and the main shaft of the wind mill. Inside the\nhub, a system to actuate the aerodynamic brake is fitted. The hub is covered with nose cone.\nv. Main Shaft\nThe shaft is to connect the gear box and the hub. Solid high carbon steel bars or cylinders are used as\nmain shaft. The shaft is supported by two bearings.\nvi. Gear Box, Bearing and housing\nThe gearbox is used to increase the speed ratio so that the rotor speed is increased to the rated generator\nspeed. Oil cooling is employed to control the heating of the gearbox. Gearboxes are mounted over\ndampers to minimise vibration. The main bearings are placed inside housing.\nvii. Brake\nBrake is employed in the WTGs to stop the windmill mainly for maintenance check. Brakes are also\napplied during over speed conditions of the windmill. The brakes are placed on the high speed shaft.\nviii. Generator\nThe generator uses induction type of generator. The generators are provided with monitoring sensors in\neach phase winding to prevent damage to the generators.\nNot to replace the technology\nThe technology is a clean technology since there are no GHG emissions associated with the electricity\ngeneration. The project proponent hereby assures and undertakes that the installed technology would not\nbe replaced with any other or more efficient technology during the crediting period.\n\nCDM-SSC-PDD (version 02)\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board page 9"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

SummaryDescriptionof theProject\nThe project to change rice planting from continuous flooding to intermittent flooding was carried\nout in Wuyishan City, Nanping City, Fujian Province, with a single season rice planting area of\n10,492hectares.Withoutthisprojectprovidingditchestoconductintermittentfloodedmethod,the\ncontinuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by\ncontinuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under\nfloodedconditioncanemitalargeamountofmethane(CH 4)becauseofanaerobicdecomposition,\nthe intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and\nmethaneemissionremovalthanthecontinuously flooded.\nWiththeprojectimplementation,thecementditches,reservoirsandrelevanttechnicaltrainingare\nprovided for these farmers to help them conduct the intermittent flooded water regime during rice\ncultivation, which replaces the traditional continuously flooded method.

The project is classified in scope 14 - AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses) and\nfalls into the category Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) in the scopes of\nplanned (APD) and unplanned (AUDD) deforestation.\nThe REDD Carbonflor\u00b4s main goal is to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) through the\nconservation of native vegetation in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. The project is based on the\nconservation of the remaining forest cover of properties under pressure from deforestation and degradation.\nInformation generated by the National Institute for Space Research (\"INPE\") on monitoring forest cover in\nthe Cerrado and Amazon biomes points to increasing deforestation rates since 2012. For the Cerrado\nBiome, annual deforestation rate was of 7,905.16 km212 in 2021 (August 1st, 2020, to July 31st, 2021), a\n7,9% increase from the previous datapoint, 2020. For the Amazon biome, deforestation reached 13,235\nkm2 in 2021 (August 1st, 2020, to July 31st, 2021). This represents a 21,97% increase from the previous\ndatapoint, 2020.13\nSuch matter becomes even more relevant considering that these biomes have the highest deforestation\nrates in the country. The increases in deforestation observed in 2021 in the Cerrado and Amazon\ncorroborate the progress of deforestation activity in natural forests in Brazil, which leaves us in close point\nto reach the imbalance of the natural systems14, which affects the provisions of energy, water, and food\nsecurity in Brazil and worldwide.\nGiven the high rates of deforestation in these two biomes, the project seeks landowners who have\nproperties in the Cerrado and Amazon who choose not to deforest their properties in the legally permitted\nportions (APD), as well as guarantee the protection of permanent preservation areas (APP) and legal\nreserve (RL) of their properties (AUDD), which have also been the target of illegal deforestation and\ndegradation over the last few decades.\nIn this way, REDD Carbonflor will promote the conservation of natural forests and aims to obtain positive\nnet benefits for communities and biodiversity. Thus, in addition to reducing carbon emissions, the project\nwill promote benefits in maintaining the biodiversity of fauna and flora, providing a safe habitat for local\nfauna, increasing water retention, protecting water resources, and maintenance of the region's\nmicroclimate. Regarding the communities, the benefits will be achieved through actions of social\nengagement, education, training and capacity building, and support for local infrastructure.\nIn this context, ECCON will be responsible, as the proponent of the project, for the development of all\nstages, implementation in the different instances, and monitoring of the parameters of climate, community,\nand biodiversity of REDD Carbonflor. The other entities involved in the project are the landowners, who,\nthrough the signing of a contract and letter of intent, attest to their commitment to keeping the areas of their\nproperties conserved in the long term, which will allow for them to support the activities of the projects to\nbe developed.\n12 https:\/\/www.gov.br\/inpe\/pt-br\/assuntos\/ultimas-noticias\/nota-tecnica-prodes-cerrado-2021\n13 https:\/\/www.gov.br\/inpe\/pt-br\/assuntos\/ultimas-noticias\/divulgacao-de-dados-prodes.pdf\n14 Lovejoy and Nobre, 2019 - https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/yp6tx5eu\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 5\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nIt is important to highlight that the carbon credit revenue generated by REDD Carbonflor will contribute to\nconservation, by making the activity more attractive to rural producers supported by the project, therefore\nthe maintenance of the \u201cstanding forest\u201d will be a competitive alternative to other land uses (i.e., agricultural\nor livestock production), which are a threat to conversion of native vegetation in the current scenario.\nCarbonflor REDD activities began in 2021, with a 30-year crediting period, from October 6th, 2021, to\nOctober 5th, 2051.

This project started in 2016 and consists in improving Cree standards to protect more areas while decreasing commercial harvesting on their land to achieve more greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions. The project area represents the new conservation areas (enlarged buffer strips) under the improved Cree standards whose total area is 3 879 hectares (ha), excluding areas without merchantable and operable timber volumes. The project boundary represents Category I lands of Waswanipi located in the province of Quebec, Canada, whose total area is 60 358 ha. Prior to 2016, harvesting operations have been implemented throughout the project boundary for many years in respect to provincial and Cree standards. In 2016, thanks to the potential financial incentive to be granted through the sale of carbon credits, the CFNW adopted a new land-use plan, known as wildlife concerns, extending most of the buffer strips of riparian zones of previous Cree and provincial standards, therefore prohibiting harvesting activities in the project area. Simultaneously, the CFNW significantly reduced the harvest level in the project boundary. Both measures have had a negative impact on the earnings of the CFNW from stumpage fees. It is expected that the project scenario will generated GHG emission reductions by allowing the biomass of standing trees to fix more CO2 than the baseline scenario, where carbon is emitted in the short term by short-lived biomass fraction decomposition, wood waste combustion, logging slash decomposition, and in the long term by gradual emission of the carbon fraction sequestered in the harvested wood products over time.

Without this project providing ditches to conduct intermittent flooded method, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission removal than the continuously flooded.\\r\\nWith the project implementation, the cement ditches, reservoirs and relevant technical training are provided for these farmers to help them conduct the intermittent flooded water regime during rice cultivation, which replaces the traditional continuously flooded method. During rice cultivation, controllable irrigation and drainage according to rice growth requirements can not only save water resources, but also reduce methane emission from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions (in the flooded state). In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%1.

As one of the\npost-registration changes (under the category \u201cCorrections (that do not affect the project design)\u201d) which was\naddressed by the previously revised version of the PDD (version 6, dated 27\/12\/2013), the ex-ante estimations of\nemission reductions to be achieved by the project activity during the 1st 7-year renewable crediting period were\nrevised. As explained in Appendix 6, this revision is inter alia due to the following aspect:\n- Use of more appropriate approach for estimating the amount of methane to be generated at the AMC\nlandfill and to be collected by the project activity. Such estimations are performed by applying a more recent\nand appropriated approach as per the methodological tool \u201cEmission from solid waste disposal sites\u201d\n(version 6.0.1).\nBy taking into account the relative limitations of the methodological approach of AM0002 (version 1), the ex-ante\nestimate of methane generation at the AMC landfill is performed by applying applicable approach of the\nmethodological tool \u201cEmissions from solid waste disposal sites\u201d (version 06.0.1). Such alternative approach\npromotes more accurate and correct estimates of emission reductions (without affecting the amount of baseline\nemissions to be determined ex-post as part of the application of the project\u2019s monitoring plan + applicable GHG\ncalculations).\n20 The use of the \u201cTool to calculate baseline, project and\/or leakage emissions from electricity consumption\u201d is not\nrequired as per AM0002 (version 1). This pioneer baseline and monitoring methodology was published by the\nCDM-EB before the publication of such methodological tool. Anyhow, due to lack of appropriate guidance in\nAM0002 (version 1), this methodological tool is applied to determine leakage emissions due to the consumption of\ngrid-sourced electricity by the project activity. While in more recently issued CDM baseline and monitoring\nmethodologies, consumption of grid-sourced electricity by the project activity is regarded as \u201cproject emissions\u201d, as\nper AM0002 (version 1) and other pioneer CDM methodologies, consumption of grid-sourced electricity by the\nproject activity is regarded as \u201cleakage emissions\u201d. As summarized in Appendix 6, the previously revised version\nof the PDD (version 6, dated 27\/12\/2013) addressed as a permanent change in the monitoring plan the use of a\nmore appropriate approach for monitoring parameters required for determining leakage emissions due to the\nconsumption of grid-sourced electricity by the project activity (with related calculation approach also being included\nin the PDD in Section B.6.1 - Explanation of methodological choices).\nVersion 05.0 Page 15 of 106\n\nCDM-PDD-FORM\nLeakage emissions due to consumption of fossil fuel LPG by the project activity are determined as\nper the \u201cTool to calculate project or leakage CO emissions from fossil fuel combustion\u201d (version 2\n2)21."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_methodologies': ['ACM0002']}"}]}

Description of how the anthropogenic emissions of GHG by sources are reduced below\nthose that would have occurred in the absence of the registered small-scale CDM project activity:\nAs per the Electricity Act 2003, any entity may install power plant on its own. Also, the central\ngovernment and various state governments have come with renewable energy policies to promote\nrenewable energy technologies.\n\u2022 Electricity generation from wind farm is not a legal requirement or a mandatory choice. There\nare states and sectoral policies which are primarily framed to encourage wind based power\nproject to attract more private investment as there are many anticipated risks under the project\nand requires good amount of equity to be involved.\n\u2022 The Indian Electricity Act of 2003 does not restrict or empower any authority to restrict the fuel\nchoice for power generation. In addition, it may be noted that the draft National Electricity\nPolicy (revised in August 2004) asserts \u2018coal would necessarily continue to remain the major\nfuel\u2019.\nGovernment of India plans to generate at least 10% of the total power generation through\nrenewable sources of power by 2010 and provides a number of benefits to these projects through\nits ministries\/departments, in spite of which, the projects face barriers and are not business-as-\nusual projects. Despite facing barriers like high investment cost, financially unattractive cost of\npower generation, erratic power generation and other barriers discussed in detail in the following\nparagraphs, the project proponent has decided to contribute to environmental protection by\nundertaking to set up this project, as power generated using wind energy results in zero emission\nof greenhouse gases. The government of India provides fiscal and financial benefits to wind\npower project which include 80% accelerated depreciation and income tax exemption for 10\nyears2. Both the incentives have been taken into account while calculating the project IRR to\nassess the returns from the projects.\nThe project activity is additional as per the options provided under \u2018Attachment A to Appendix B\u2019\nof the simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale CDM project activity.\nThe project additionality as per the Attachment A to Appendix B is given below:\nJustification for additionality of the project\nAs per Attachment A to Appendix B the project participants shall provide an explanation to\nshow that the project activity would not have occurred anyway due to at least one of the\nfollowing barriers:\na) Investment barrier: a financially more viable alternative to the project activity would have\nled to higher emissions;\nb) Technological barrier: a less technologically advanced alternative to the project activity\ninvolves lower risks due to the performance uncertainty or low market share of the new\ntechnology adopted for the project activity and so would have led to higher emissions;\nc) Barrier due to prevailing practice: prevailing practice or existing regulatory or policy\nrequirements would have led to implementation of a technology with higher emissions;\n14\n\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-PDD) - Version 03\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board\nd) Other barriers: without the project activity, for another specific reason identified by the\nproject participant, such as institutional barriers or limited information, managerial\nresources, organizational capacity, financial resources, or capacity to absorb new\ntechnologies, emissions would have been higher.\nInvestment Barrier:\nThe investment analysis for this project activity is done as per the Methodological Tool \u2013\u201cTool\nfor the demonstration and assessment of additionality\u201d, version 05.2, EB 39.\nAs per this tool, project proponent is required to determine that the project activity is not:\n(a) The most economically or financially attractive; or\n(b) Economically or financially feasible, without the revenue from the sale of certified emission\nreductions (CERs).\nBy applying the following sub-steps:\nSub-step 2a: Determine appropriate analysis method\nAs per Sub-step 2a, Paragraph (1), Option I i. e. Simple Cost Analysis can be used only if the\nCDM project activity generate no financial or economic benefits other than CDM related income. As\nthe proposed CDM project is selling the electricity generated to the regional electricity grid &\ngetting financial benefits other than CDM benefits hence, Option- I is not applicable. Option II\n(Investment Comparison Analysis) or Option III (Benchmark Analysis) is therefore applicable to\nthe project activity. Further, as per paragraph 16 of \u2018Guidelines on the Assessment of Investment\nAnalysis\u2019 (Version- 3.1, EB- 51) - If the alternative to the project activity is the supply of\nelectricity from a grid this is not to be considered an investment and a benchmark approach is\nconsidered appropriate. Hence, project promoter has considered Benchmark analysis to prove\nthe additionality of the project.\nSub-step 2b: Option III. Apply benchmark analysis\nThe \u2018Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality\u2019 (Version- 05.2, EB- 39)\nrequires the PP to identify the financial indicator, such as IRR, NPV, cost benefit ratio, or unit\ncost of service (e.g. levelized cost of electricity production in $\/kWh or levelized cost of\ndelivered heat in $\/GJ) most suitable for the project type and decision-making context. The tool\npermits the use of either Project IRR or Equity IRR to demonstrate the additionality of the\nproject. Since the project is 100% equity funded, PP has considered project IRR as suitable\nfinancial indicator, as the equity IRR and project IRR will be same for the project.\nSuitability of benchmark:\nThe PP\u2019s has decided to follow the \u201cTool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality\u201d\n(Version- 05.2, Annex- 10, EB- 39) which allows following options to derive the benchmark for\nproject activity.\na) Government bond rates, increased by a suitable risk premium to reflect private investment\nand\/or the project type, as substantiated by an independent (financial) expert or documented\nby official publicly available financial data;\n15\n\n[['', '', 'Suzlon', 'Enercon'], ['No. of machine', '', '3.00', '2.00'], ['Capacity \/machine', 'KW', '1,250.00', '800.00'], ['Total Capacity', 'KW', '3,750.00', '1,600.00'], ['Generation and sale of\\nelectricity', '', '', ''], ['Net Annual generation from\\nthe Project', 'Million kWh', '6.244', '2.726'], ['Plant Load Factor', 'Percent', '19.01%', '19.45%'], ['Selling rate', 'INR\/kWh', '4.28', '4.28'], ['O&M charges', 'INR in Million', '2.355', '1.00'], ['Escalation in the O&M\\nexpenses', 'Percent', '5%', '5%'], ['O&M applicable', 'Year', '3rd', '2nd'], ['Service tax on O&M charges', 'Percent', '10.30%', '10.30%'], ['Deration in Energy on 6th,\\n10th, 14th and 18th year.', 'Percent', '1.25%', '1.25%'], ['Insurance', 'INR in Million', '0.283', '0.131']]\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-PDD) - Version 03\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board\nb) Estimates of the cost of financing and required return on capital (e.g. commercial lending\nrates and guarantees required for the country and the type of project activity concerned),\nbased on bankers views and private equity investors\/funds required return on comparable\nprojects;\nc) A company internal benchmark (weighted average capital cost of the company), only in the\nparticular case referred to above in paragraph 5.

The energy\nthat will be generated by the project is currently dispatched by other power plants that are connected to\nthe national grid, and that include fossil fuel power plants. Hence, the baseline scenario and the scenario\nprior to project implementation are the same and the project will help to reduce thermal power generation\nin the National Interconnected System (SIN1) by providing renewable energy to the grid.\nThe project activity is a run-of-river hydroelectric plant that includes the construction and installation of a\nconcrete weir and intake, a desander, channel, forebay\/settling tank, high-pressure penstock,\npowerhouse and discharge channel. Two Pelton turbines with 10.115 MW and two synchronous\ngenerators with 11,174 kVA each2 will be installed. Each generator will be connected to a transformer to\nincrease the voltage from 6.6 kV to 35 kV at the project site. The installed capacity of the plant at the\ninterconnection point will be around 19.5 MW (this is based on the design and can vary slightly at real\nconditions).\nThe electricity generated by the project is expected to be around 104.5 GWh per year, which will be\ndelivered to the SIN. It will help to reduce thermal power generation in the SIN by providing renewable\nenergy to the grid. Thus, it will contribute to sustainability by increasing the share of renewable energy\nand reducing GHG emissions. The expected average annual emission reductions are 32,102 tCO during 2\na renewable 10-years crediting period.\nMoreover, the project activity will facilitate the achievement of electricity demand required for the social\nand economic development of the country based on a renewable energy source. The project will\ncontribute to the region\u2019s sustainable development in the following ways:\nThe project will decrease emissions of sulphur oxides (SO ), nitrogen oxides (NO ), carbon x x\nmonoxide, particulate matter, other pollutants, as well as carbon dioxide associated with the\ncombustion of fossil fuels.\nThe project will reduce the dependence on fossil fuels, which are non-renewable and limited in\nsupply.\nDuring construction, the project will provide employment opportunities.

Whilst this land is available, communities lack the financial\nresources to plant trees.\nThe initial project activity instance will be in extension of the Delft township, situated to\nthe south and east of the principle Delft township (Figure 1). This area falls within the\nCape Metropolitan Area in the City of Cape Town. The principle township had a\npopulation of 60,667 residents in 20016.

This is a practice endorsed by the VCS grouped project methodology.\nThese additional instances will meet the eligibility criteria listed in Section 1.16 and will\nbe validated and formally incorporated into the grouped project during each verification\nperiod.

Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\\r\\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter.

New instances will be incorporated only if they satisfy in addition\nto the requirements under methodology VM0007 and module VMD0006 (BL-PL) the following\ncriteria\nWhere inclusion of a new project activity instance necessitates the addition of a new project\nproponent to the project, such instances shall be included in the grouped project within five years\nof the project activity instance start date.\nThe risks to GHG reductions or removals are illegal logging and fire both of which would reduce\nthe amount of carbon stocks present in the property.\nv3.0 13\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nFirewood collection is not deemed a risk because the population density is very low and the main\nuse of firewood is for cooking. Unsustainable fuel wood collection is not occurring within the\nproject boundaries. Thus unsustainable fuel wood collection is not a source of leakage or\nemissions for this project.\nThe quantization of GHG reductions removals will be carried out following section 3 of this project\ndescription and merits no additional information in this section.\nThe grouped project has a central GHG information system and controls associated with the\nproject and its monitoring. The central GHG infomation system and controls will require that All\ndata will be digitalized, stored at different locations and stored for at least 2 years beyond the\ncrediting period as required under section 3.18.1 of the VCS Standard v3.2. For all instances the\nfollowing tasks will be undertaken\n1. The baseline scenario will be reviewed every ten years.\n2. Monitor carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions.\n3. Estimation of ex-post net carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions\n4. Monitor leakage and greenhouse gas emissions\nIn addition, all instances will be subjected to the same procedures of section 4 with regards to\n1. Data to be collected: list of data and parameters\n2. Overview of data collection procedures\n3. Quality control and quality assurance procedure\n4. Data archiving\n5. Organisation and responsibilities of the parties involved in all the above\n6. Frequency\nThere are no equivalent type and level of activity of products or services provided by the project\nand the baseline scenario. On the contrary, in the baseline scenario, the project area produces\ncattle and in the project, the forest remains standing. This significant difference between the\nproject and the baseline scenario is to be expected in this methodology, as agricultural activities\nare incompatible with forest remaining forests.\nLeakage Management\nUnder the followed module BL-PL there are only two sources of leakage: Market effects and\nactivity shifting. The first is calculated using module LK-ME. This module does not use any\nleakage management areas or proxy areas. The second is calculated using LK-ASP. In this\nproject the deforestation agent is always known. Therefore part I and not part II of LK-ASP\napplies. In addition, the project does not include an instance with peatland. Therefore part II of\nv3.0 14\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nLK-ASP does not apply to the project as well. Part I does not make any use of leakage\nmanagement nor proxy areas to determine leakage and none were defined or used. Rather, it\nlooks at the areas that the deforestation agent deforested. In addition, the deforestation agent no\nlonger owns the part of the property that is excluded from the project and therefore that area is\nirrelevant to the leakage calculation. When identified deforestation agents do own land that can\nbe legally deforested, the project will include them as part of its leakage management areas. As\ndeforestation agents are always identified, no proxy areas will be used in the project.\nThe leakage management program consists on monitoring the properties owned by the\ndeforestation agent as evidenced by land registry records. At this point in time, the deforestation\nagent does not own any properties that can be deforested. If properties that can be deforested\nexist in the future, they will be monitored for deforestation and if so, they will be used in the\ncalculation to determine leakage. The leakage management program therefore is necessary\n(even if today leakage is deemed to be zero) because in the future, identified deforestation\nagents may own property that can be deforested.\nCommercially Sensitive Information\nProof of ownership, images showing proxy areas defined in section 1.5 of BL-PL, deforestation\npermits and business plans have been excluded from the project description\nFurther Information\n2 APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_name': 'Protection of the Bolivian Amazon Forest', 'project_summary': 'Validation achieved to the CCB Standards Second Edition, Biodiversity Gold Level, on 26 March 2012; expired on 26 March 2017.This project will protect the Bolivian Amazon forest from planned deforestation, initially protecting 235 has of tropical rain forest.

Description of the small-scale project activity:\n>>\nProject activity:\nThe project proponent, Agrawal Renewable Energy Private Limited (AREPL), has proposed to develop a\n14.70 MW wind power project at site-Jath, Taluka-Jath, District-Sangli, State-Maharashtra in India. The\nproject activity will generate electricity utilising wind energy and will supply the generated electricity to\nthe regional NEWNE grid. In absence of the project activity equivalent amount of electricity would have\notherwise been generated by existing and new power plants connected to the emission intensive NEWNE\nelectricity grid. Thus the project activity would result in avoidance of Green House Gases (GHGs)\nemission and contribute to mitigation of global warming. The project activity (i.e. green field project\nactivity) is expected to be commissioned by end of March 2012.\nThe project proponent has placed the purchase orders to Suzlon Energy Limited and its group companies\nto supply and install the proposed wind power project. Suzlon shall also provide operation and\nmaintenance services to the project activity.\n1. Purpose of the Project Activity:\n\u2022 To utilize renewable wind energy for generation of the electricity.\n\u2022 To sell the generated electricity to Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited\n(MSEDCL).\n\u2022 To contribute in mitigating the climate change.\na. Pre-project scenario:\nIn the absence of the project activity, the equivalent amount of electricity would have been generated\nfrom the connected \/ new power plants in the NEWNE grid, which are \/ will be predominantly based on\nfossil fuels. The main emission source in the pre-project scenario is the power plants connected to the\nNEWNE grid and main greenhouse gas involved is CO . 2\nb. Project scenario:\nThe project activity is a renewable source of power generation and would supply electricity to the\nNEWNE grid. The total planned capacity of the project activity is 14.70 MW. The project activity will\nuse wind energy in producing electricity and no other input will be used, therefore, it will not produce\nany greenhouse gas emission during its lifetime.\nc. Baseline scenario:\nThe baseline scenario is that the electricity delivered to the NEWNE grid by the project activity would\nhave otherwise been generated by the operation of the grid-connected power plants and by the addition of\n3\n\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-PDD) - Version 03\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board\nnew generation sources into the NEWNE grid. Hence, pre-project scenario and baseline scenario are the\nsame.\n2. Reduction of GHGs emissions due to the project activity:\nThe project activity essentially involves generation of electricity from wind energy. The employed\nWTGs use wind energy to produce electricity and do not use any other input-fuel for electricity\ngeneration. The operation of WTGs is emission free and no GHG emissions are produced during the\nlifetime of the project activity.\nThe project activity replaces anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere,\nwhich is estimated to be approximately 23,411 tonnes of CO2e per year, by displacing the equivalent\namount of electricity generation through the operation of existing fuel mix in the grid comprising mainly\nfossil fuel based power plants and future capacity expansion connected to the grid.\nThe WTGs installed in the project activity are connected to the NEWNE grid. Therefore, the emission\nfactor associated with the NEWNE grid is used to evaluate baseline emissions for the project activity.\nThe project boundary composed of the WTGs, transformer, the metering equipment, substation, and the\nNEWNE grid, which is used to transmit the generated electricity.\nThe project activity does not result in any greenhouse gas emissions and it is a clean source of electricity.\nThe technology is a clean technology as there are no GHG emissions associated with the electricity\ngeneration. Technology is indigenous, available within the country, and environmentally safe and sound.\n3. Contribution of the project activity to sustainable development:\nThe National CDM Authority (NCDMA), which is the Designated National Authority (DNA) for the\nGovernment of India (GoI) in the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), has stipulated four\nindicators for sustainable development in the interim approval guidelines for Clean Development\nMechanism (CDM) projects in India1. The project proponent believes that the project activity has\ncontributed to sustainable development in terms of the four indicators as follows:\nI. Social well being:\nThere are several activities associated with the erection and commissioning of WTGs and this has\nresulted in generating employment for both skilled and unskilled manpower. People have been employed\nin both onsite and offsite activities thus creating direct and indirect employment opportunities that\ncontribute up to some extent in poverty alleviation of the local community. The project activity also\ncontributes in meeting the electricity deficit in India and hence improves quality of life of the people.\nThus, the project activity has contributed to social well being.\nII. Economic well being:\nThe project activity requires temporary and permanent, skilled and semi-skilled manpower at the wind\npower project site. Hence, this will create additional employment opportunities. It will also provide\nbusiness opportunities for local vendors, contractors and suppliers.\nIII. Environmental well being:\nThe project activity reduces the emissions of local and global pollutants. It also conserves the non-\nrenewable energy resources as the project activity does not consume any non-renewable resource for\n1 http:\/\/www.cdmindia.in\/approval_process.php\n4\n\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-PDD) - Version 03\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board\ngenerating the electricity. There is no solid waste from the project activity that generally happens in the\ncase of most of the other sources of power. Thus, the project activity contributes to environmental well-\nbeing without causing any negative impact on the surrounding environment.\nIV. Technological well being:\nThe investment in renewable technologies like wind will boost the sector and propel R&D in this field\nthus helping in evolution of better and more efficient technologies.\nThus, the project activity contributes towards the sustainable development of the region."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

For BFP, the FAO (2008) National Soil Degradation Maps were used to show the\nland was classified as degraded; however, since the soil degradation assessments used to compile the map were\nobtained in the 1980s, it had to be shown that the drivers and pressures that led to the land becoming degraded are\nstill present, and there are no or insufficient management interventions to reverse degradation. The drivers and\npressures of land degradation in the region have been from charcoal and fuelwood production, as well as agriculture.\nThese drivers are still present as can be seen from field evidence as well as the EIA and FSC assessment reports.\nFurther evidence that the anthropogenic degradation drivers and pressures that led to the land becoming \u201cdegraded\u201d\nare still present (procedure (a) (i)) was provided by direct visual field evidence of selected indicators of land\ndegradation. Land is classed as degraded and\/ or degrading if a reduction in plant cover due to overgrazing or other\nland management practices is shown. As shown in the land classifications from 1994 and 2004, shown in section 1.10,\nthere has clearly been a loss of forest vegetation in this time period, which demonstrates that the land is degrading.\nFigure 2.2.1, shown below, shows the national soil degradation map for Uganda11. Overlaying this image in Google\nEarth, it can be seen that the BFCR has severe soil degradation12.\nFigure 2.2.1. National Soil Degradation Map for Uganda\nIn addition to the FAO soil degradation map and the land classifications shown in section 1.10, a time series analysis\nfrom 1975-2005 using Landsat imagery further substantiates the successive pattern of degradation, as can be seen in\nFigure 2.2.2.\n11 FAO (2008) National Soil Degradation Maps http:\/\/www.fao.org\/landandwater\/agll\/glasod\/glasodmaps.jsp\n12 KMZ file available to substantiate\nv3.0 33\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nFigure 2.2.2. Time series analysis showing vegetation change in the BCFR between 1975 and 200513\nThis multi-temporal change image highlights vegetation change in the area \u2013 magenta shows decreases in vegetation\nand green showing vegetation increase. It can clearly be seen that almost the whole of the BCFR has experienced a\nvegetation decrease between 1975 and 2005.\n13 The time series analysis is publically available from the ESRI website: http:\/\/changematters.esri.com\/compare\nv3.0 34\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n(b) If at least a part of the project activity is implemented on organic soils, drainage of these soils is not allowed\nand not more than 10% of their area may be disturbed as result of soil preparation for planting;\nThe project is not taking place on any organic soils. As mentioned in 1.13, Additional Information, the soils in the BCFR\nare alluvial soils ending up into sandy clay soils.\n(c) The land does not fall into wetland14 category\nNo wetlands will be planted and the PP has a SOP, Procedure 20, \u201cDetecting and demarcating wetlands\u201d, which is\nfollowed to delineate and exclude any such areas from the project area.\nThe project proponent is not choosing to account for changes in carbon stock in soil organic carbon (SOC) pool in the\nproject scenario, and thus, consequently applicability conditions (d) and (e) from the methodology do not apply.\nThe combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality in A\/R CDM project activities, has the\nfollowing applicability conditions:\n\u2022 Forestation of the land within the proposed project boundary performed with or without being registered as the\nA\/R CDM project activity shall not lead to violation of any applicable law even if the law is not enforced\nThis is applicable to the BFP \u2013 as the project is taking place in a central forest reserve, forestation is the only\nactivity which can legally take place within the reserve.\n\u2022 The tool is not applicable to small \u2013 scale afforestation and reforestation project activities\nThis is met since the BFP is not a small-scale project."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_methodologies': ['ACM0001']}"}]}

Without the project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded conditions can emit a large amount of methane because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittently flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase, and less methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\\r\\nThe implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir construction, pumps and valves installation, training, etc. According to the needs of rice growth, farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice \\r\\npaddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in the rainy season. In this case, the methane emission can be declined by an average of 48%.

The area of forest land allocated to Hainan Jinhua Forestry Co., Ltd is about 14,600 ha, including two tree species,  eucalyptus and Acacia mangium. Of these, the Acacia mangium forest land is involved in the the Improved Forest Management (IFM) project of the forests in the conversion of logged to protected forest.\\r\\nThe area of the project activity is 4863 ha, including 126 subcompartments spreading over Baisha, Baoting, Changjiang, Ledong, Lingshui, Qiongzhong, WuzhiMountain. All these departments are 100% owned by Hainan Jinhua Forestry Co., Ltd and have the legal right to forest ownership. The specie involved in the project is Acacia mangium. This is common local tree species.\\r\\nPrior to the implementation of the project activity, Hainan Jinhua Forestry Co., Ltd harvested trees in the project area in accordance with a valid timber management plan approved by the government.\\r\\nThe implementation of the project activity converses the trees to protected forest to reduce the GHG emissions for about 3,187,713 tCO2e in 30 years, the average annual emission reduction is 106,257 tCO2e and Verified Carbon Units with buffer deduction is about 2,486,416 tCO2e in 30 years, the average annual VCUs with buffer deduction is 82,881 tCO2e.\", 'project_state_province': 'Hainan', 'project_country': 'China', 'project_latitude': 19.0, 'project_longitude': 109.0}"}]}

The project activity falls under the small scale projects. The methodology chosen for\nthe project activity and its applicability to the project activity is discussed below.\nType I: Renewable Energy Projects\nCategory D: Grid Connected Renewable Electricity Generation\nTechnology\/measure\n1. This category comprises renewable energy generation units, such as photovoltaics, hydro,\ntidal\/wave, wind, geothermal and renewable biomass, that supply electricity to and\/or\ndisplace electricity from an electricity distribution system that is or would have been supplied\nby at least one fossil fuel fired generating unit.\n2. If the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a wind\/diesel\nunit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small- scale CDM project activity applies only to the\nrenewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel5, the capacity of the entire unit\nshall not exceed the limit of 15MW.\n3. Combined heat and power (co- generation) systems are not eligible under this category.\n4. In the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy generation\nunits at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added capacity of the units added\nby the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be physically distinct6from the\nexisting units.\n5. Project activities that seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for renewable energy\ngeneration are included in this category. To qualify as a small scale project, the total output of\nthe modified or retrofitted unit shall not exceed the limit of 15 MW.\nThis project activity comes under point number 1 of the technology \/measures of AMS I-D.\nThe applicability of this methodology may be explained through the following arguments\n\u2022 The project activity involves electricity generation using renewable energy which is\nbased on wind power and sale of the electricity generated to the respective ESCOM\u2019s.\n5 Co-fired system uses both fossil and renewable fuels.\n6 Physically distinct units are those that are capable of generating electricity without the operation of\nexisting units, and that do not directly affect the mechanical, thermal, or electrical characteristics of the\nexisting facility. For example, the addition of a steam turbine to an existing combustion turbine to\ncreate a combined cycle unit would not be considered \u201cphysically distinct\u201d.\n12\n\nVCS Project Description Template\nThis project activity displaces the equivalent amount of electricity generation through\nthe operation of existing\/proposed fossil fuel based power plants connected to the\nGrid.\n\u2022 The project activity involves installation of renewable energy generation units only\n(Wind Turbine Generators)\n\u2022 The project activity doesn\u2019t involve cogeneration system. The project activity\ninvolves electricity generation from the Wind Turbine Generators.\n\u2022 The project activity doesn\u2019t involve addition of renewable energy generation units at\nexisting power generation facility.\n\u2022 The project activity doesn\u2019t seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for\nrenewable energy generation.\n\u2022 The total installed capacity of the project activity is 10.25 MW which is less than the\neligibility limit of 15 MW to qualify as a small scale project activity under Type I of\nthe small scale methodologies Also no additional WTGs will be added to the project\nactivity during its lifetime; Hence the project activity will remain under small scale\nproject activity during every year of crediting period.\nHence it can be concluded that the selected methodology, AMS I D \u2013 Grid Connected\nRenewable Electricity Generation is applicable to project activity"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

The project is intended as a grouped one, in which the long-term vision is to manage multiple\nsectors of eastern CAR in the prefectures of Mbomou, Haute-Kotto and Haut-Mbomou (See in Figure 1 the\ngeographical boundaries). African Parks has an agreement with the CAR government in place since 2014\nfor the protection of four hunting zones and signed a new one in 2020 for the inclusion of new ones.\nThe conditions prior to the implementation of the project had several factors that impacted the well-being\nof communities and community groups living on the periphery of the project area. These include insecurity\nin the region, persistent conflict between transhumant pastoralists and local communities, lack of education\nand employment opportunities, and poor healthcare. These factors had an impact on the ecosystems and\nbiodiversity of the region as well, where practices like unsustainable hunting and an economy of illegal\nwildlife trade, transhumant pastoralism and unsustainable agricultural activities were performed widely.\nThe overall objective of the project is to secure a core protected area in eastern CAR and to actively engage\nin the land use planning and sustainable management of the surrounding areas in order to restore and\nimprove ecosystem functions and habitat, through community engagement, law enforcement and\nrestoration and conservation activities. Below are the specific objectives.\nClimate objectives: Enhance the restoration of natural ecosystems, leading to increasing the CO storage 2\nand avoiding the emissions resulting from disturbance and conversion.\nCommunity objectives: Improve the lives, livelihoods and safety of local communities by implementing\ncommunity projects, land use planning and sustainable resources management.\nBiodiversity objectives: Enhance the conditions for conservation and habitat management including\nrestoration and maintenance of biodiversity and associated ecosystem services while improving the\npopulation of endangered species.\nThe measures to be implemented by the project are focused on reducing the impact of the main agents\nand drivers of deforestation and conversion, by creating new and more sustainable opportunities for those\nagents in the wider landscape. These activities include sensitisation of the local communities and\ntranshumance pastoralists, the establishment of pastoralism corridors and more sustainable natural\nresource use. Moreover, the project will increase employment opportunities, continuation of biodiversity\nmonitoring and restoration of natural areas among others. The success in the implementation of these\nactivities is expected to generate greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions reductions (Check section 2.1.11 for\nmore details of the project activities).\nUpon the implementation of the project activities described above, the project is expected to generate an\nestimated annual average of net emissions reduction of 442,839 tCO2e and a total of 4,558,205 tCO2e for\nSep 2016 \u2013 Dec 2026 period, according to the Non-Permanence Risk assessment the buffer discount\nobtained was 6.5% but the minimum assumed is 10%, therefore, after applying the buffer the average\namount of tradable VCUs per year during this period is 398,553 and totalling 4,102,366 for Sep 2016 \u2013 Dec\n2026 period.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3\n11\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nFigure 1: Project location14 showing the project area, the project accounting areas and the expected geographical\nboundaries of expansion of the grouped project in the East of Central African Republic (prefectures of Mbomou,\nHaute-Kotto and Haut-Mbomou).\n(Source: South Pole, 2023)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_name': 'CHINKO CONSERVATION AREA REDD+ PROJECT, CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC', 'project_summary': 'Nestled in Eastern Central African Republic (CAR), lies a wildlife refuge called Chinko.

Poaching and natural resource exploitation were rampant; and the ethnic violence inflicted upon civilians was beyond devastating.

There are no wetlands in the project area.\nUruguay Land categories can be checked in the following web site from the Environmental Government\nEntity https:\/\/www.ambiente.gub.uy\/visualizador\/index.php?vis=sig\n\u2022 Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10 per cent of area\nin each of the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project boundary:\n(i) Land containing organic soils;\n36\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\n(ii) Land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land use and management practices and receives inputs\nlisted in appendices 1 (Cropland in which soil disturbance is restricted) and 2 (Grassland in which soil\ndisturbance is restricted) to this methodology.\nSoil Disturbance\nThe disturbance to the soil attributable to the project activity covers plough strips of 0,8 m width every 4\nm to the effectively planted area, representing 11,7 % of the total \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 project area and 20% of\nthe \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 VCS project boundary area. Having said this, the soil types of the project cannot be\ncategorized as (i) organic or (ii) grassland in which soil disturbance is restricted. According to 2006 IPCC\nGuidelines (Annex 3A.5, Chapter 3, Volume 4), organic soils must have at least 12 percent organic carbon\nby weight (i.e., about 20 percent organic matter). As it is described by Silva Silva30 organic matter content\nin brunosoles soils (from Coneat 2) range from 3.1 to 8.2%. In this soil type the organic matter content,\nand hence the organic carbon, does not reach the 20% of the organic soils. Given that, as above stated\n\u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 project soils are classified as Coneat 2, it is concluded that the soil types of the project are\nnot organic.\n\u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 project lands are characterized by grazing activity with regular usage capacity and without\ntechnological improvements, implanted pastures or crops. These natural grasslands do not receive\nintensive management with added agricultural inputs such as fertilization, reseeding, etc. The soils are\nof reduced natural fertility and current erosion is relatively low. Hence, the Project is applicable to this\nmethodology.\nA project activity applying this methodology shall also comply with the applicability conditions of the tools\ncontained within the methodology and applied by the project activity.\nThis standard establishes a set of specific requirements for afforestation and reforestation project\nactivities, among which stands out the eligibility of the land.\nIn order to demonstrate the land eligibility, the PP should follow the \u201cProcedures to Demonstrate the\nEligibility of Lands for Afforestation and Reforestation CDM Project Activities\u201d in which Project participants\nshall provide evidence that the land within the planned project boundary does not contain forest and that\nthe activity is a reforestation or afforestation project activity The land eligibility is demonstrated though\nthe use of satellite imagery showing that vegetation on the land has been below the forest threshold\naccording to the definition of forest adopted by Uruguay. In this regard, the table below provides the\ndetails of the adopted definition\n37\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nThe satellite images displayed below show that the land did not contain forest on 31 December 1985 nor\nin 2009, 2013 and 2016. Satellite image from July 2021, shows the forest plantation at \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 site.\nThe land was covered by natural pastures and some scattered trees planted for cattle shade not\nqualifying as forest.\n38\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nAccording to the baseline scenario the project pervious land use was grassland (management practices\nlisted in appendix 2 apply). The project will be implemented on degraded lands which are expected to\nremain in a degraded state in the absence of the project. Extensive grazing activity have made the soil\nlost the original vegetation and a fraction of the soil organic matter, an essential component determining\nland productivity, leading to constraints to productivity.\nThe change in vegetation due to grazing reduced the turnover of plant residues and, consequently the\norganic matter content of the soil, thus leading to a more degraded state of soils.\nThe project will be implemented on degraded lands which are expected to remain in a degraded state in\nthe absence of the project. Evidence is provided here showing that, due to extensive grazing activity\npracticed for more than 300 years, with frequent periods of overgrazing, lands have lost the original\nvegetation and a fraction of the soil organic matter, an essential component determining land\nproductivity, leading to constraints to productivity, particularly in those areas affected by severe erosion.\nIn addition, due to frequent periods of overgrazing causing the soil to become exposed to erosive\nprocesses (i.e., due to lack of vegetation cover) combined with dominating moderate slopes in the terrain,\ngully erosion processes have affected most of the lands within project boundaries.\nNative vegetation in the project region was originally composed mainly by tall grasses and shrubs. The\nturnover of plant residues maintained relatively high levels of organic matter in the soil. Introduction of\n39\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\ncattle in the 17th century brought about a degradation of the vegetation, which became dominated by\ngrasses that were kept short by grazing, particularly after introduction of sheep a few decades later. The\nsheep and cattle extensive grazing activity has prevailed, more or less unchanged, until present. Due to\nthe extensive nature, the production system is vulnerable to climate extremes, the relatively frequent\ndroughts that occur in Uruguay (e.g., dry periods every summer, with extreme droughts every 10 years or\nso) are associated to overgrazing.\nGrazing practices applied on all the lands included within project boundaries during long periods of time\nhave resulted in significant losses of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients from the soil, and\nhave also resulted in significant alterations to the vegetation cover and the biological diversity.\nThe change in vegetation due to grazing reduced the turnover of plant residues and, consequently the\norganic matter content of the soil, thus leading to a more degraded state of soils. Some recent studies\nsupport this statement. Pi\u00f1eiro et al (2006)1 (peer-review study) have found that 370 years of grazing\nhave caused, on average for 11 grassland sites in Argentina and Uruguay, decreases in soil organic\nnitrogen content (\u2212880 kg ha\u22121 or \u221219%), soil organic carbon content (\u221221,200 kg ha\u22121 or \u221222%) and\nnet primary productivity (\u22122,192 kg ha\u22121 or \u221224%). The conditions in which this study was conducted\nmatch those of all the sites included in the project activity.\nAnother peer-review study prepared by Altesor et al. (1998)27 arrived to similar conclusions. Five sample\nplots on grassland sites in North Uruguay were measured in 1935 and revisited in 1990. It was concluded\nthat continued grazing causes an increase in the number of weedy species and decreasing the palatable\nforage species. This is an indicator of a presently and continuous degrading process. The findings of this\nstudy are applicable to all sites included in the project activity.\nThe First Report of Uruguay to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification prepared by DINACEA\n(National Environmental Directorate) in 20003 governmental peer-review study) states in its Section 2.1\nthat the way in which extensive grazing is practiced deteriorates the natural pasture since it is based on\nthe assumption that the natural grassland ecosystem can support mismatches between grazing pressure\nand forage availability induced by weather and\/or market. The report also states that the strong\nfluctuations in the prices of major agricultural products hinder an adequate planning of the production\nunits, which is essential for the conservation of natural resources. In Section 1.6 of that report, it is stated\nthat the climatic variations frequently produce \u201cforage crises\u201d both in summer and winter times, resulting\nin overgrazing and a consequent loss of species. The concepts included in this report are valid for all\nland units included within project boundaries, since previous land use in all sites has been extensive\nlivestock production based on grazing.\n1 Pi\u00f1eiro, G., Paruelo, J.M. and Oesterheld, M. 2006.

For electricity supply, the NCPG provides the equivalent amount of electricity produced by the Project in the baseline. \\r\\nThe purpose of the Project is to utilize the extracted CMM with low concentration methane concentration to produce electricity. No coal bed methane (CBM) or ventilation air methane (VAM) utilization is involved. Fifteen sets of CMM power generators will be installed with a total installed capacity of 7.5MW (8*0.5 MW+7*0.5 MW), destroying 16.25 million m3 of methane annually. After the full operation of the Project, the expected annual exported electricity will be 31850 MWh, which will be supplied to the coal mine first through the electricity distribution network in Xiadian coal mine area, and then to NCPG if there is any electricity surplus, replacing the electricity that would otherwise have been purchased from the NCPG and displace part of the electricity generated by NCPG dominated by fossil fuel-fired power plants.', 'project_state_province': 'Shanxi', 'project_country': 'China', 'project_latitude': 36.53, 'project_longitude': 112.91}"}]}

The project will directly support the livelihoods of these 72 communities,\ncomposed of approximately 10,291 families and a population of 33,040 people. Despite global and\nregional importance, the area\u2019s forests continue to suffer an uncontrolled conversion to agricultural land,\nand a progressive degradation of the forest due to indiscriminate logging, the expansion of the agricultural\nfrontier, forest fires, extensive livestock, and illicit crops. The lack of employment opportunities,\ninfrastructure and basic services, and the promotion of illicit economies, lead the local population to clear\nforests for income generation.\nIn response to the threats to the Choco Biogeographic landscape in the Bajo Atrato region, the nine (9)\nCommunity Councils, their 72 communities, and Wildlife Works decided to create the BARP, which has\nthe following objectives:\n\u25aa Climate: Mitigating climate change and its effects through the reduction of CO2 emissions produced by\ndeforestation and the development of adaptation strategies to climate variability.\n\u25aa Community: Improve the quality of life of communities by strengthening self-government, governance,\nand the development of sustainable production systems.\n\u25aa Biodiversity: Contribute to the conservation of biodiversity through community-based forest\nmanagement, land appropriation, and forest monitoring, control, and surveillance.\nThe climate benefits of the Project are expected to include an average emission reduction of 485,291 t\nCO2e per year, and a total of 15,044,035 t CO2e during the project lifetime. The project will generate\nsignificant benefits for the community and biodiversity. In terms of community benefits, existing livelihoods\nwill be strengthened, and new sustainable livelihoods designed to reduce pressure on the environment\nwhile increasing community well-being.

Justification of the choice of the methodology and why it is applicable to the project\nactivity:\nThe application of the baseline methodology AM0029 to the proposed project is justified for satisfying\nthe three conditions:\n(cid:151) Condition 1: The project activity is the construction and operation of a new nature gas fired grid-\nconnected electricity generation plant.\nThe project activity is a new nature gas fired grid-connected electricity generation plant and no other\nfuel except natural gas is consumed. The project activity is currently under construction and will be\ncommission completely in August of 2007.\n(cid:151) Condition 2: The geographical\/physical boundaries of the baseline grid can be clearly identified and\ninformation pertaining to the grid and estimated baseline emissions is publicly available.\nThe electricity generated by the proposed project will be sold to Zhejiang Power Grid, which is an\nintegrated part of the East China Power Grid. As demonstrated in B.6, the grid for baseline emissions\ncalculation is the East China Power Grid, whose geographical\/physical boundaries can be clearly\nidentified and the information pertaining to the East China Power Grid and estimated baseline\nemissions is publicly available3.\n(cid:151) Condition 3: Nature gas is sufficiently available in the region or country, e.g. future nature gas based\npower capacity additions, comparable in size to the project activity, are not constrained by the use of\nnature gas in the project activity.\nNatural gas is sufficiently available in Zhejiang Province. According to the Natural Gas Pipeline\nNetwork Planning of Zhejiang Province (Gui-497, September of 2005), the natural gas supply of\nZhejiang Province comes from three sources: natural gas transferred from west, East China Sea gas\nfield and imported LNG. The natural gas supply is as follows:\nTable B1 Natural Gas Supply in Zhejiang Province (unit: 108Nm3\/a)\n3 http:\/\/cdm.ccchina.gov.cn\/WebSite\/CDM\/UpFile\/2006\/2006121591135575.pdf\nThis template shall not be altered.

According to the feasibility study report of the project, the\nexpected consumption of natural gas by the proposed project is 5.3354\u00d7108Nm3\/a, which is very\nsmall amount compared with the total natural gas available in Zhejiang Province. Furthermore,\naccording to the Natural Gas Pipeline Network Planning of Zhejiang Province, the natural supplying\nto industry user, natural gas power plant, natural gas thermal plant and civil use is ensured. Therefore\nthe natural gas which will be consumed by the proposed project would not displace the natural gas\nthat would otherwise be used elsewhere in an economy.\nTo summarize, the approved baseline methodology, AM0029: \u201cBaseline Methodology for Grid\nConnected Electricity Generation Plants using Natural Gas\u201d is applicable to the proposed project.\nThe approved monitoring methodology AM0029 \u201cGrid Connected Electricity Generation Plants using\nNon-Renewable and Less GHG Intensive Fuel\u201d is applicable for:\n(cid:151) The applicability of the associated baseline methodology is justified.

This goal will be achieved\nthrough the expansion of monitoring of the area, along with the inclusion of the local community\nin the project activities, with environmental education and alternative sources of income to\nminimize risks of invasion and deforestation within the project area and the reference region.\nAs aforementioned throughout this project description document, the present REDD Project plans\nto implement a program regarding the extraction of NTFPs as a way of providing an alternative\nincome source for the local communities that surround the project area.\nBrazilian law such as Decree No. 6,040 ensures the rights of traditional people and communities\nof attaining sustainable development, and by this, activities such as collection of forest products\nare permitted as long as they do not cause any damage to the area in question35.

Income from\nthe sale of credits will make it possible to invest in the educational and professional training of\nchildren and adults in the community.\nBeyond the project\u2019s ecological and carbon benefits, the implementation of REDD and\nSOCIALCARBON mechanisms promotes benefit sharing of carbon credits revenues.\nThe SOCIALCARBON methodology will serve as a plan and guideline for carrying out activities and\nachieving goals, in addition to assessing progress in each monitoring period. In this way, the\nowners are committed and add value to the carbon project with each action taken, encouraging\nlong-term sustainable development and driving continuous improvement in the local community\nthrough prospects (at least one per Resource, totaling 6 improvement actions), on which the\nproject proponent undertakes to implement them until the next monitoring period.\nTo guarantee the progression of the socioenvironmental scenario in the region, the\nSOCIALCARBON Standard requires that at least 50% of the actions suggested on the previous\nPoint assessed are implemented, under the risk of losing the Standard.

The total installed capacity of the project is 80 MW; which involves operation of 40 Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) with capacity of 2 MW each located at Maharashtra state in India. The project is promoted by Panama Wind Energy Godawari Private Limited. The power produced displaces an equivalent amount of power from the grid, which is fed mainly by fossil fuel fired power plants. Hence, it results in reduction of GHG emissions. GHG emission reductions from the project activity will be 136,936 tonnes of CO2 and total GHG emission reductions for the chosen 10 year crediting period will be 1,369,360 tonnes of CO2The Project activity is a new facility (Greenfield) and the purpose of the project activity is to generate energy electricity by the utilization of wind velocity power and further selling the generated energy to the NEWNE Grid.

(GPL), the Project Proponent (PP) in collaboration with\nthe National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the active promoter of\nparticipatory Watershed Development Programmes in the Government, Semi-government and\nNGO sectors. The project integrates watershed development and the adoption of Sustainable\nAgriculture Land Management (SALM) practices by Smallholder farmers within the proposed\nwatersheds. The villages which are selected for the Watershed Development Project under the\nWatershed Development Fund (WDF) are Bavi, Jamb and Zapewadi in the BEED District of\nTaluka. Shirur (K) of Maharashtra. The selected villages of Beed District, fall under the major\nDrought Prone Areas (DAPs) of the Marathwada region and comes in the VIIth Agro-climatic zone\nof the State such as Assured Rainfall Zone, where scarcity of ground water is acute. Through the\nWatershed Management programme & sustainable farming under SALM, the PP aims at multiple\nenvironmental assets for the smallholder farmers in the watershed area such as Sustainable\nWater Management, Improved Carbon Sequestration (Soil & Tree Carbon Sequestration) and\nLivelihoods.\nThe proposed project integrates sustainable agricultural land management practices aiming at\nsoil carbon enhancement, since agriculture is the main source of income for the farmers involved\nin the project. Hence the overall goal of the project is to improve the livelihoods of small and\nmarginalized farmers in the project area by restoring their degraded agricultural lands through the\nwater & soil carbon conservation techniques and adopting SALM practices for the sustainable\nfarming. The PP focuses on the benefits of improved living conditions of the farmers and\nincreased yields arising from improved cultivation techniques by demonstrating synergies\nbetween climate-change adaptation and mitigation strategies in agriculture.\nThe project activity has a three year roll out which begins in 28\/07\/2017 and ends in 27\/07\/2020.\nThe implementing SALM practices for the 3-year roll out period includes Nutrient Management\n(Green manure, Cover crops, Composting Etc), Soil & Water conservation techniques\n[Continuous Contour Trench (CCT), Water Absorption Trench (WAT), Pits, Stone Gully Plug\n(SGP), Earthen Gully Plug (EGP) etc.], Agronomic practices and Agro forestry. About 50%-80%\nof the land area adopted by SALM activities during the first 2 years and the entire area will be\ncovered for the implementation during the third year. The project is undertaken by the small scale\nfarmers in the entire project area i.e 3274.65 Ha across in three watersheds.The proposed\nproject activity comes under the eligible AFOLU Project category of Agricultural Land\nManagement (ALM) and under the sub category of eligible ALM activities - Improved Crop land\nManagement (ICM). The applicability of ALM Project activity in this project encompasses\nv3.3 3\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nactivities that increase soil & tree carbon sequestration through improved water management\nand\/ reduce GHG emission by establishing, increasing or restoring vegetative cover through\nSALM Practices. The implementation of the proposed project activity under the Verified Carbon\nStandard (VCS) scheme promotes the sustainable development in the region, brings benefits to\nthe local communities and to the whole carbon offset mitigation.\nThe project foresees achievement of GHG mitigation through soil & tree carbon sequestration.\nAdditionally, the project seeks to generate socio-economic benefits including poverty alleviation\nand potential long term income stream to the participating farmers. In this perspective land\nmanagement practices under watershed management can reduce greenhouse gas emissions\nand prevent climate change by enhancing carbon storage in soils; conserving existing soil\ncarbon; and decreasing GHGs emissions. This also improves their food security, which is now\nmore important than ever given the vulnerability to climate change.\nThe estimate of annual average GHG reductions and removals through adoption of SALM\npractices in the agricultural landscape is 33764 tCO e and total reductions estimations are 2\n675272 tCO e. The Project activities are carried out and monitored according to approved VCS 2 methodology VM0017: Adoption of Sustainable Agricultural Land Management1 for a crediting\nperiod of 20 years renewable."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_name': 'Agricultural Land Management  project in Beed District, India implemented by Godrej Properties Ltd.', 'project_summary': 'PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD: This project is open for public comment from 7 July - 6 August 2017.

Farmers in the project area cultivate on\ntheir own land, so there will be no displacement that could cause leakage. Displacement of pre-project\nagricultural activities is not foreseen and, if it occurs, it will be to land with SOC and biomass stocks\nequal to or lower than the original agricultural land. Therefore, leakage is considered to be zero.\nCommercially Sensitive Information\nNo commercially sensitive information has been excluded from the public version of the project\ndescription.\nFurther Information\nNot Applicable as there is no additional relevant information, since everything is mentioned in this PDD\nand other relevant documents.\n2 SAFEGUARDS\n2.1 No Net Harm\nEnvironmental Impact: the project has a demonstrably positive impact on the environment,\nunderpinned by rigorous criteria for selecting eligible plots. The project has implemented a robust\noperational framework with comprehensive monitoring and follow-up mechanisms to mitigate any\nadverse effects on the territory.\nThe project's environmental benefits are substantial and closely intertwined with the socio-economic\nwell-being of the local communities. Through the strategic implementation of agroforestry systems, crop\nrotation, intercropping techniques, and the incorporation of plant cover, the project has achieved a\nrange of highly favourable outcomes. These measures serve as effective safeguards against soil\nerosion, enriching the agro-biodiversity of the land, and providing coffee growers with diversified income\nsources.\nNotably, these environmentally friendly practices not only safeguard natural resources but also yield\ntangible socio-economic advantages for the communities involved. By embracing sustainable\nagricultural techniques, our project not only minimises negative impacts but actively promotes positive\noutcomes. This holistic approach harmoniously balances environmental conservation with the\neconomic well-being of local communities, ensuring the enduring impact of our efforts and fostering a\nsustainable future.\nOur commitment to preserving natural areas is steadfast, and our criteria for plot selection are\ndesigned to avoid deforestation. We understand the critical importance of safeguarding natural\nhabitats and have established stringent guidelines to ensure that our project never encroaches on\nthese valuable ecosystems.\n35\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\nFurthermore, our operational framework is meticulously designed to monitor and evaluate the project's\nimpact continuously. We proactively address any potential negative consequences, swiftly adapting our\nstrategies to mitigate them.\nSocial Impact: the project adheres to the fundamental principle of Free, Prior and Informed Consent\n(FPIC), recognizing it as an essential collective human right belonging to Indigenous Peoples and Local\nCommunities (IP\/LC). This right empowers these communities to grant or withhold their consent prior to\nthe initiation of any project that could impact their rights, lands, resources, territories, livelihoods, and\nfood security.\nIn the context of potential social impacts, it is worth noting that Oaxaca boasts a diverse and culturally\nrich environment, home to approximately 19 distinct ethnic groups coexisting harmoniously. These\ngroups and communities have established internal governance mechanisms that enable active\nparticipation in decision-making processes, fostering representation, diversity, and a deep-rooted\nconnection to their ancestral territories.\nThe project's implementation is entrusted to CEPCO, a reputable social organisation with a remarkable\ntrack record spanning over three decades, primarily dedicated to collaborating with coffee growers in\nthe region. CEPCO has consistently demonstrated a genuine commitment to the welfare of the territory\nand its residents, endowing it with the legitimacy required to promote sustainable development\ninitiatives.\nCEPCO operates through a network of 45 cooperatives, each governed by its own committee\nresponsible for representing and coordinating its members. Across the 7 distinct regions organised by\nCEPCO, representatives are democratically elected to serve on the State Council. This Council convenes\non a monthly basis and maintains a continuous presence at CEPCO's central offices during their two-\nyear mandate, diligently overseeing the organisation's activities.\nEvery two years, a comprehensive assembly convenes, bringing together 400 to 500 farmers hailing\nfrom various corners of the state. It is within this assembly that the project underwent a thorough\nprocess of socialisation, consultation, and agreement, involving all the hierarchical structures within\nthe CEPCO governance framework. Ultimately, the project was presented to and received approval from\nthe general assembly, affirming its alignment with the principles of FPIC (Free, Prior and Informed\nConsent), and its commitment to respecting the rights and values of the Indigenous Peoples and Local\nCommunities of Oaxaca."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_name': 'Sustainable coffee landscapes in indigenous rural communities of Oaxaca, Mexico', 'project_summary': 'This project is designed to support the livelihoods of at least 3,250 smallholder coffee producers from which at least 1,000 are women, in the State of Oaxaca, Mexico , by increasing the resilience of their coffee production systems after the impact caused by coffee rust.

Isangi is a town located at the confluence of the Congo and the Lomami Rivers. The Isangi REDD+ project area is comprised of upland and lowland tropical forests that harbor a critical center of biodiversity and supports a large but isolated human population. Initially in tandem with Jadora, Inc., a firm based in Seattle, WA, but now solely managed by SAFBOIS as the project proponent, the Isangi REDD+ Project was formerly a SAFBOIS-owned logging concession, which has now been developed into a REDD+ project to preserve this critical ecosystem . Current project activities and the secession of logging has demonstrated that the Isangi project will remove over ten million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the earth's atmosphere through improved management -- enough to offset three months of carbon emissions for the city of New York or 100,000 average US households for a year.The Isangi project provides many benefits to indigenous people. The project area is home to 30 villages with a combined population of more than 50,000 people. The Isangi project protects high conservation value forests, providing ancillary benefits to the wildlife and the people and is one of the most diverse habitats on the planet. It supports threatened and endangered species such as leopards, forest elephants, Red River hogs, 14 species of primates, (most notably the Bonobo chimpanzee), dwarf crocodiles, hornbills and rare bats. The area hosts 11% of the world's known bird species and is a haven of biodiversity.Key Facts:\u2022 A former logging concession converted to a REDD+ (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) conservation project\u2022 Project area: 184,000 hectares of primary forest\u2022 Verified and Validated in September 2014, achieving the highest industry standard, a Gold rating by the VCS and CCBA; seek\", 'project_state_province': 'Orientale Province', 'project_country': 'Congo, Dem.
