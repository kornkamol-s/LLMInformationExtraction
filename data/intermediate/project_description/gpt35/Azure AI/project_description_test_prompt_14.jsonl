This area is owned by the Commonwealth of Virginia, under authority of the VA Department of Environmental Quality. The VCR Seagrass Restoration Project, initiated in 2015, involves the restoration of seagrass meadows at the VCR through direct seeding. Seagrass meadows remained absent from the coastal bays of the VCR until the late 1990s. In 1999, TNC and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) began a large-scale eelgrass restoration effort at the VCR. By the project start date in 2015 eelgrass restoration efforts had already maximized natural recruitment, and continued seed additions were necessary to further increase eelgrass extent across the VCR coastal bays. Data collected at restoration plots established by direct seeding revealed a larger habitable area than the natural recruit distribution, indicating that eelgrass extent could reach up to 107 square kilometers with continued seed additions. Direct seeding of restoration plots will continue in the carbon project to further expand seagrass coverage. The University of Virginia (UVA) and VIMS have studied the seagrass restoration effort at the VCR since its inception, increasing understanding of the long-term effects of expanding eelgrass coverage at the VCR and the potential role for seagrass meadows in mitigating climate change. Seagrass restoration directly increases carbon storage in submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and marine sediments, enhancing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission removals from the atmosphere.

{"input":"Question: What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?\n\nContext: \n\n1 PROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire has experienced dramatic deforestation for the last decades: forest area decreased from\n16 Mha in 1960 to 2.9 Mha in 2021. Deforestation is driven first by slash-and-burn agriculture for both\nfood and cash crops by smallholders.\nTo address this issue, the Government of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire adopted in 2019 a Strategy for the Preservation,\nRehabilitation and Extension of Forests (SPREF) that opened, notably, the involvement of the private\nsector in the management of gazetted forests through concession instruments. The current project falls\nunder this framework, specifically in the \u201cFor\u00eat Class\u00e9e du Haut-Sassandra\u201d (FCHS), in center west of\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n15 years ago, the 104,000 ha of Haut-Sassandra forest were still covered by a magnificent semi-\ndeciduous forest. As of today, 95% of its surface has been deforested and is now under illegal cocoa\nplantations and fallows.\naDryada (a French development company specialized in nature-based solutions and biodiversity\nconservation) and its Ivorian partner, Agromap, signed an agreement with the Ministry of Water and\nForest for the rehabilitation of the FCHS. A 40-year concession agreement is currently being negotiated.\nThe project aim is the permanent reestablishment of a largely natural and largely intact forest over\n70,000 ha of the FCHS. The main activities to be implemented are: 1\/ plantation of a very diversified mix\nof native species in both fallow and cocoa parcels and 2\/ Assisted natural regeneration in remaining\ndegraded forests. As the main goal is to reestablish a natural forest and its biodiversity, no harvesting\nactivities are envisaged. The project is expected to generate significant GHG removals of c. 36.8 MtCO2e\nover the crediting period and an annual average of c. 890 ktCO2e.\nAgroforestry schemes are implemented in the remaining 34,000 ha as well as around the FCHS to ensure\nsources of sustainable livelihoods to local populations, contributing to the long-term success of the\nproject.\nKaridja project includes an important package to support sustainable economic transition, social\ninfrastructures improvement and trainings to provide long term social co-benefits to local communities.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nSectoral Scope: 14.

CCX is the Project Proponent (PP) of the carbon offset project\ncalled \u201cBan Odisha01\u201d in all districts of Odisha. The carbon credit rights is transferred to CCX which in\nturn will share the carbon revenue to farmers on realisation of carbon credits. The individual farmers are\nthe owners of the lands on which trees are being grown to sequester carbon and reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions from the atmosphere. CCX has mobilized the farmers in the selected states of India to plant\nvarious tree species on their lands. These tree species range from fruit bearing trees like Indian\nblackberry, Guava, Mango, lemon to commercial species like cashew, arjuna, asana, teak, mahogany,\netc. Simple tree cultivation techniques involving planting saplings in the pits with minimum disturbance\nto the lands have been employed by the selected farmers.\nThe villages under the project area predominantly have an agrarian economy where most of its population\ndepends on agriculture. The condition prior to the project initiation was barren land or agriculture as\nmaize, chili, pulses and paddy or other commercial crops were grown by the farmers on their farmlands\nwith limited agroforestry species. The planation was done by the farmers and utilized the subsidies to\navail the saplings. The saplings do the sequestration of carbon dioxide at faster pace and ultimately\nreduces GHG emissions.\nThe Project Activity will lead to considerable carbon sequestration in the project areas and will contribute\nstrongly to the sustainable development of rural villages involved in the project.\nThe project quantifies the GHG removals occurring from agroforestry plantations through the use of AR-\nACM0003: \u201cAfforestation and reforestation project activities implemented on lands other than wetlands\u201d,\nVersion 02.0 developed under the Clean Development Mechanism for large-scale plantations. The project\nplans to generate carbon credits for the voluntary market under the VCS standard. Such planting activity\nwould result in carbon credits that would be sold in the carbon market to generate revenue. As per the\nCarbon-offset agreement entered into between the farmers and CCX, 60%-80 of the carbon income\ngenerated from the sale of carbon credits would be distributed among the farmers. The project activity\nwas implemented in 1900 hectares.

The\nproject is designed to establish forests on degraded lands previously deforested and\/or converted\n(croplands or settlements).\nMost of the lands to be planted were deforested since 1950s. Significant deforested lands were\nconverted to croplands and settlements to support livelihood for increased residents. Other land\nremained as barren lands and have never been reforested since then. Due to human disturbance,\ndesertification and sandification as well as soil erosion, the barren lands are degraded and degrading\nwhich would continue under the without project scenario.\n2,059.4 ha of forest is to be established by direct planting on degraded lands in 12 forestry farm of\nYitulihe Forestry Bureau and 12 forestry farms of Genhe Forestry Bureau. 66.3%% of reforestation\nactivities are carried out in a mixture of different tree species for a purpose of enhancing resilience.\nMajor species and Afforestation models include 480.64 ha of Spruce (Picea meyeri Rehd.et Wils),\n214.6 ha of Mongolian Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica Litv.), 546.0 ha of mixture of spruce\nand larch (Larix gmelinii (Rupr.)

However, intermittent flooded water regime\nrequires that irrigation and drainage can be controlled according to the growth needs of\nrice during its cultivation. Whereas, the low economic level leads to the low income of\nfarmers, which means that farmers have no additional economic capacity to afford the\nconstruction of the branch ditches which can practice controllable irrigation and drainage.\nTo improve the infrastructure conditions of agricultural production, increase food\nproduction, and promote sustainable agriculture, the project was implemented. Therefore,\nthe project was not implemented to generate GHG emissions for the purpose of their\nsubsequent reduction, removal, or destruction.\nSince the conditions existing prior to the project initiation is the same as baseline scenario,\nplease refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario) to see the detail information. Besides, this\nproject does not affect the environmental conditions, including climate, hydrology,\ntopography, soils, relevant historical conditions, type of vegetation, ecosystems, etc., so,\nthe present and prior environmental conditions of this project are the same, which are\nlisted as follows.\n8 The ex-ante investigation report of Anzhou in 2019 from Anzhou Bereau of Agricultural and Rural\nAffairs\n10","output":"{'project_name': 'Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation in Anzhou District', 'project_summary': 'The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Anzhou district within Mianyang City, Sichuan Province of China, with a total acreage of 16,084 ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\\r\\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%1 .

Combining sustainable development with carbon\nsequestration, TIST supports the reforestation and biodiversity efforts of about 87,000\nsubsistence farmers. Carbon credit sales generate participant income and provide project\nfunding to address agricultural, HIV\/AIDS, nutritional and fuel challenges. As TIST expands to\nmore groups and more areas, it ensures more trees, more biodiversity, more climate change\nbenefit and more income for more people.\nSince its inception in 1999, TIST participants organized into over 12,000 TIST Small Groups have\nplanted over 18 million trees on their own and community lands. GhG sequestration is creating a\nlong-term income stream and developing sustainable environments and livelihoods. TIST in\nUganda began in 2003 and has grown to about 14,500 TIST participants in about 2,200 Small\nGroups.\nUG PD-VCS-001 is a grouped AFOLU project, eligible under the Afforestation, Reforestation and\nRevegetation (ARR) category.

The technology comprises a natural\ncirculation steam boiler with 5% continuous rate of blow-down. The treated water is heated to\nreach its saturated temperature of 105\u00b0C in an economizer utilizing the return condensate and\nhot flue gases (at about 160\u00b0C).\nInside the combustion chamber in the boiler, the rice husks are mixed with air at an inlet\ntemperature of 170\u00b0C. The rice husks are kept in suspension using circulating fluidized bed\nmechanism by use of blowers at the bottom and induction fans at the top of the boiler. This\nfeeding system increases the overall boiler efficiency compared to normal feeding system which\nis a fuel efficient feature in this technology. In order to control the quality of the rice husk ash,\ntemperature inside the boilers need to be maintained at 450\u00b0C-650\u00b0C. This is achieved through\nthe design of internal inclined reciprocating grate which allows the ash to cool down prior to\nentering the ash collection system at the bottom of the boiler.
