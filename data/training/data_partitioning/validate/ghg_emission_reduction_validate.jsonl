As suggested\nby the tool, it is assumed that the implementation of the project activity increases the SOC content of the\nlands from the pre-project level to the level that is equal to the steady-state SOC content under native\nvegetation. The increase in SOC content in the project scenario takes place at a constant rate over a period\nof 20 years from the year of planting. The project meets the applicability conditions of this tool since:\n\uf0b7 the areas of land to which the tool is applied do not fall into wetland category, do not contain organic\nsoils and are not subject to any of the land management practices and application of inputs listed\nin Tables 1 and 2 of the tool;\n\uf0b7 Since the land use prior to project start is grassland, only Table 2 applies. For the temperate warm\nmoist climate region corresponding to the project activity, none of the three combinations included\nin Table 2 are applicable;\n\uf0b7 litter remains on site and is not removed and soil disturbance is in accordance with appropriate\nconservation practices, limited to site preparation and not repeated within 20 years.\nTable 13. Parameters used for estimation of SOC\nSOC at the beginning of the project (SOC ) is estimated by multiplying the factors in Table 13 by the INITIAL,i\nreference SOC. As per the tool, a loss in SOC (SOC ) is applied in the case that soil disturbance occurs LOSS,i\non more than 10 per cent of the land area, which is the case of Guanar\u00e9\/FAS project.

Introduction of Monitoring Plan\nThis Monitoring plan will set out a number of monitoring tasks in order to ensure that all aspects of\nprojected greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions for the proposed project are controlled and\nreported. This requires an on going monitoring of the Project to ensure performance according to its\ndesign and that claimed Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) are actually achieved.\nThe monitoring plan of the proposed project is a guidance document that provides the set of procedures\nfor preparing key project indicators, tracking and monitoring the impacts of the proposed project. The\nmonitoring plan will be used throughout the defined crediting period for the Project to determine and\nprovide documentation of GHG emission impacts from the proposed project. This monitoring plan fulfils\nthe requirement set out by the Kyoto Protocol that emission reductions projects under the CDM have real,\nmeasurable and long-term benefits and that the reductions in emissions are additional to any that would\noccur in the absence of the certified project activity. The monitoring plan provides the requirements and\ninstructions for:\n(cid:1) Establishing and maintaining the appropriate monitoring systems for electricity generated by the\nproject;\n(cid:1) Quality control of the measurements;\n(cid:1) Procedures for the periodic calculation of GHG emission reductions;\n(cid:1) Assigning monitoring responsibilities to personnel;\n(cid:1) Data storage and filing system;\n(cid:1) Preparing for the requirements of an independent, third party auditor or verifier.\n2. Management structure responsibility\nThe monitoring of the emission reductions will be carried out according to the diagram shown in\nFigure B.7.2-1. The Vice general Manager will hold the overall responsibility for the monitoring process\nand approval of the monitoring report. The plant operation staff, is responsible for the measurement of the\nmonitored data, and assisted the monitoring officer on the plant site.\nThe monitoring officer will be appointed by the vice general manager. The monitoring officer will be\nselected from among the senior technical or managerial staff. Before he\/she commences monitoring\nduties, he\/she will receive training on CDM monitoring requirements and procedures.\nThe monitoring officer will be responsible for carrying out the following tasks:\n\u2022 Supervize and verify metering and recording:\nThe monitoring officer will coordinate with plant operation staff to ensure and verify adequate metering\nand recording of data, including power delivered to the grid.\n\u2022 Collection of additional data, sales \/ billing receipts:\nThe monitoring officer will collect sales receipts for power delivered to the grid, billing receipts for\npower delivered by the grid to the hydropower station and additional data such as the daily operational\nreports of the hydropower station.\n\u2022 Calibration:\n\n[['Plant Operation Staff'], ['Onsite monitoring']]\n[['Monitoring Officer'], ['Monitoring implementation and managing']]\n[['Vice General Manager'], ['Overall responsible']]\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM PDD) - Version 03.1\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board\npage 39\nThe monitoring officer will coordinate with staff of the Project owner to ensure that calibration of the\nmetering instruments is carried out periodically in accordance with regulations of the grid company and\nin accordance with relevant industry standards.\n\u2022 Calculation of emission reductions:\nThe monitoring officer will calculate the annual emission reductions on the basis of net power supply to\nthe grid. The monitoring officer will be provided with a calculation template in electronic form by the\nProject\u2019s CDM advisors.\n\u2022 Preparation of monitoring report:\nThe monitoring officer will annually prepare a monitoring report which will include among others a\nsummary of daily operations, metering values of power supplied to and received from the grid, copies of\nsales\/billing receipts, a report on calibration and a calculation of emission reductions.\nFigure B.7.2-1 Management structure for monitoring\n3.

As addressed in the PD, this is\ndue to the manner in which the Project is operated, such as: no vehicles, manual labor\nconducted by the small-hold farmers on their own land, restrictions on chemical fertilizers, no\nclearing of baseline trees and minimal disturbance of the ground for planting.\nProject Removal Calculations\nThe following provides the step-by-step procedure used to determine the Project GHG\nremovals:\nStep 1. Because of the difference in species and age of the trees and location, ownership\nand management of the project areas, each project area is monitored. They are\ndocumented in the \"PA Summary\" worksheet of Appendix 14. The location of each PA was\nobtained with a GPS and is also provided in the \"PA Summary\" worksheet of Appendix 14.\nThe boundary of each project area was obtained using a GPS and provided in PD Appendix\n03. The area was calculated and is listed with each project area in the \"PA Summary\"\nworksheet of Appendix 14.\nStep 2. The strata for the ex-post estimation of the actual net greenhouse gas removals was\ndone by species and year similar to the ex-ante estimate as described in PD Section 3.2.\nStratification was done within each individual project areas. The area of a stratum in a\nproject area (\"Area of a Stratum (ha)\") was determined by multiplying the area of project area\n(see Step 1) by the percentage of trees of that stratum in the respective project area. The\nresults are provided in the \"Ex-post Strata\" worksheet of Appendix 14.\nStep 3. Where a tree species exceeded 10% of the total tree inventory, it was assigned to a\nMajor Strata. All other tree species were assigned to an \"Other\" strata. Based on the\ntabulations in Appendix 14, there are four major strata: eucalyptus, grevillea, cypress and\nother.\n21\n\nMonitoring Report: VCS Version 4.0\nStep 4. Allometric equations were used to convert DBH values to biomass. An allometric\nequation for each Major Strata was identified. If a species specific equation for a Major\nStrata was unavailable, it used the \"Other\" equation as a default. Allometric equations were\nresearched and the most appropriate ones identified by the Proponent were assigned to the\nmajor strata. Because no better allometric equation could be found for grevillea and cypress,\nthey were assigned to the \"Other\" equation. The following is the assignment.\nEucalyptus14: Log Y = -2.43 + 2.58 Log C\nGrevillea: no species specific equations, will use \"Other\" equation\nCupressus: no species specific equations, will use \"Other\" equation\nOther (default)15: Y = (0.2035 x DBH2.3196) x 1.2\nWhere:\nY= aboveground dry matter, kg (tree)-1\nDBH = diameter at breast height, cm\nC = circumference at breast height, cm\nln = natural logarithm\nexp = e raised to the power of"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}
