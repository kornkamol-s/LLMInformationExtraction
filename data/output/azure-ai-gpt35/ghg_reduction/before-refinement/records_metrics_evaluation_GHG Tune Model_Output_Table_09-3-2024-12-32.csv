PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
3.2 Project Emissions
The project activity involves harnessing of wind energy and its conversion to electricity. Hence,
according to the methodology ACM0002, Version 17.0, there will be no project emissions, i.e. PE y
= 0.
3.3 Leakage
As per the methodology ACM0002, Version 17.0, no leakage has been considered, therefore,
LEy = 0.
3.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
Ex-ante calculation of emission reductions is equal to ex-ante calculation of baseline emissions
as project emissions and leakage are nil.
BE = EG * EF y PJ, y grid, CM, y
Where:
BE = Baseline emissions in year y (tCO /yr) y 2
EG = Quantity of net electricity generation that is produced and fed into the grid as a PJ,y
result of the implementation of the CDM project activity in year y (MWh/yr)
EF = Combined margin CO emission factor for grid connected power generation in grid,CM,y 2
year y calculated using the latest version of the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for
an electricity system” (tCO /MWh) 2
Baseline emission factor (Combined Margin) (EF ) = 0.9777tCO e/MWh grid, CM, y 2
Since, the project activity is the installation of a new grid - connected renewable power plant,
EG = EG PJ,y facility,y
EG = Quantity of net electricity generation supplied by the project plant/unit to the grid facility,y
in year y (MWh/yr)
Therefore, annual electricity supplied to the grid by the project (EG ) has been calculated as: facility,y
EG = 59.4.MW (Capacity) x 18% (PLF) x 8760 (hours) facility,y
= 93346.560 MWh
As,
EG = EG , PJ,y facility,y
EG = 93346.560 MWh/yr PJ,y
Therefore, annual Baseline Emissions (BE ) = EG * EF y PJ, y grid, CM, y
= EG * EF facility,y grid, CM, y
= 93346.560 MWh x 0.9777 tCO e/MWh 2
= 91266 tCO e/yr 2

3.2.3 Leakage
The leakage is estimated as follows:
𝐿𝐾 = 𝐿𝐾 (11) 𝑡 𝐴𝐺𝑅𝐼𝐶,𝑡
Where:
𝐿𝐾 𝑡 = GHG emissions due to leakage, in year t; tCO 2-e
𝐿𝐾 = Leakage due to the displacement of agricultural activities in year 𝐴𝐺𝑅𝐼𝐶,𝑡
t, as estimated in the tool “Estimation of the increase in GHG
emissions attributable to displacement of pre-project agricultural
activities in A/R CDM project activity”; tCO -e 2
According to the A/R Methodological tool “Estimation of the increase in GHG emissions attributable
to displacement of pre-project agricultural activities in A/R CDM project activity”, leakage emission
resulting from displacement of the activities is composed of decrease in carbon stock in the carbon
pools of the land and change in soil organic carbon stock due to land-use change in the land.

Where:
𝐿𝐾 = Leakage due to the displacement of agricultural activities in year 𝐴𝐺𝑅𝐼𝐶,𝑡

∆𝐶 = Decrease in carbon stock in the carbon pools of the land 𝐵𝐼𝑂𝑀𝐴𝑆𝑆,𝑡
receiving the activity displaced in year t; t d.m
∆𝑆𝑂𝐶 = Change in soil organic carbon (SOC) stock due to land-use 𝐿𝑈𝐶,𝑡
change in the land receiving the displaced activity in year t; tC ha
The project was implemented by manual operation, rather than mechanical operation. Besides, no
weeding, chopping, pruning, intermediate cutting activities are going to be conducted during the
crediting period because of the natural condition, the economic condition and the slow growth
pattern. Fertilization and watering are not going to take place, neither. Therefore, there is no
expected leakage due to decrease in carbon stock in the carbon pools of the land and change in
soil organic carbon stock. In other words, there is no expected leakage due to the displacement of
agricultural activity from the project activity.
Therefore, leakage is zero for the proposed project.
3.2.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
Net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks
The net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks shall be calculated as follows:

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
Per the VCS guidelines, a mandatory baseline re-evaluation is to be executed at a minimum of every 10
years after the project start. Therefore, there will be a mandatory baseline re-evaluation on or before 1
June 2027 and on or before 1 June 2037.
PDR.9 A timeline including the first anticipated monitoring period showing when project
activities will be implemented.
The first monitoring period extends from the project start date of 1 June 2017 through 31 December
2019. Project measures have already been implemented within the initial Kamlapar ILG. These
measures include forest patrols and remote sensing of natural and anthropogenic disturbances within
the PAI. These are discussed in more detail in section 5.
PDR.10 A timeline for anticipated subsequent monitoring periods.
The first monitoring period extends from the project start date of 1 June 2017 through 31 December
2019. Project activities have already been implemented within the Kamlapar ILG, the first PAI included
in the project. These activities include forest inventories including land use patrols, remote sensing of
disturbances, and community engagement focused on education and capacity building. These activities
and measures are discussed in more detail in section 5. The project expects to verify every one to two
years to incorporate additional project activity instances.
The timeline for subsequent monitoring periods is flexible, but will likely happen annually when an
additional PAI is added to the project or every other year if no additional PAI is added in the first year of
that respective monitoring period. The project proponent anticipates the addition of a PAI each year,
which would result in one year monitoring periods for the entirety of the project lifetime.

Table 1 provides an ex-ante estimate of credit generation across the project lifetime. These numbers
use estimates that the project will expand over time to include additional PAIs similar to the initial
Kamlapar PAI. These are explained in more detail in Section 4.2.4.

1.11 Description of the Project Activity
The project has identified several factors responsible for deforestation:
 Industrial timber operations, including high-grading and unsustainable extraction.
 Harvest of tropical roundwood for international export.
 Access of secondary agents of deforestation to forested areas and lack of alternative livelihood
options
In order to mitigate these factors and achieve solutions that will reduce deforestation, the project has
planned the following series of actions:
 Preventing large-scale unsustainable industrial timber harvesting and production. This is
undertaken by the project proponent and will reduce the amount of GHG emissions by
preventing large amounts of forest degradation.
 Monitoring of the region to identify and prevent further illegal logging. This will reduce the
amount of deforestation caused by secondary agents of deforestation, thus reducing the
amount of GHG emissions from the project area. NIHT is working with the Kamlapar ILG in the
first PAI to ensure the monitoring and reporting of any illegal logging on their land is carried out.
 Providing electricity in region, either through solar, water, or geothermal means directly reduce
the demand for logged or harvested firewood. This may also indirectly reduce the supply of
wood products by increasing incomes in these areas and providing alternative livelihood
options that do not exploit forest resources. NIHT will be supporting the implementation of this
project activity with clan guidance and input.
 Increasing access to co-benefits such as education, technology, clean water, and healthcare in
the region will aid in expanding opportunities for alternative livelihoods, as well as increase
local stakeholder capacity and support of the project which has the potential to indirectly
decrease pressure on local forests. The project proponent will assist in building partnerships
with relevant institutions and organizations that can support the clans in implementing these
activities through sustainable development pathways.
 Supporting clan business ventures and economic opportunity through supporting sustainable
business options (coconut oil) and offering gainful employment in project activities that will
provide alternative livelihoods that do not result in damage to the forest. The clan committees,
specifically the community development and distribution committees, will work together to

Comparison of actual emission reductions with ex ante estimates:
The monitoring period 19-Jan-2020 to 31-Oct-2021 covers 652 days, and the emission
reductions would have been 232,198 tCO 2e 45 according to the ex ante estimates. The actual
emission reductions achieved during this monitoring period are 205,738 tCO e, which is 11% 2
lower46 than the estimated emission reductions. This is mainly because not all generators were
in operation during the initial months of the monitoring period.
If the actual number of days in operation of each generator taken into consideration, the actual
emission reductions achieved during this monitoring period are 3.10% lower than the ex ante
emissions, as calculated in Table 6-1.

Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.1
As mentioned in section 4.1 above, the only GHG emissions applicable to Salto Pilão project
is from water reservoirs of hydro power plants (PE ). However, considering that the project has a HP,y
power density of 1,279.2 W/m2, there are no project emissions involved in the project.
4.3 Leakage
According to the methodology, “no other leakage emissions are considered. The emissions
potentially arising due to activities such as power plant construction and upstream emissions from
fossil fuel use (e.g. extraction, processing, transport etc.) are neglected”.
4.4 Estimated Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
According to the selected approved methodology ACM0002, emission reductions are
calculated as follows:
E R y = B E y − P E y Equation 9
Where:
ER Emission reductions in year y (tCO e/yr); y 2
BE Baseline emissions in year y (tCO e/yr); y 2
PE Project emissions in year y (tCO e/yr). y 2
Considering equation 1, estimated emission reductions of Salto Pilão project is presented in
the table below.

1.8 Description of the Project Activity
The proposed project activity is installation and operation of 48 WEGs of 800kW each, totalling to
38.4MW. Wind World (India) Limited is the technology supplier. Technical description of technology that
will be installed has already been detailed out in section 1.1 of VCS PD.
The average lifetime of WEG model WW-53 is 20 years. PP conducted third party PLF Assessment for
the proposed project activity. As per the third party report, Plant Load Factor has been calculated to be
22.30%.
The proposed project activity is a Greenfield project and envisages supplying clean energy to NEWNE
regional grid. In the absence of the proposed project activity, equivalent amount of electricity would have
been supplied to the grid by more GHG-intensive means (operation of existing grid-connected power
plants and addition of new generation sources).
Scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project activity has been detailed out in section 1.1
and 1.10 of VCS PD.
The proposed project activity is grid-connected, Greenfield, renewable energy project, which harnesses
the available wind energy in the region, in order to generate electricity and supply the same to the
NEWNE regional grid. The proposed project activity does not consume any amount of fossil fuel, thereby
reducing GHG emissions, which would have otherwise been generated by operation and addition of more
GHG-intensive means.
1.9 Project Location
The proposed project activity is located in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan, India. The exact location of all
the WEGs implemented under the proposed project activity has been detailed below:

3.3 Leakage
The only leakage emission source considered in the selected methodology is leakage due to the
displacement of agricultural activities, and must be calculated using the tool AR-TOOL1531.
In the project area of the first activity instance, as described in sections 1.1, 1.13 and 2.4., there
was not any agricultural activity pervious to the project activity. Therefore, there will not be
displacement of agricultural activities and leakage for the first instance will be set equal to zero
(LK =0). ,t
In future project activity instances, if displacement of agricultural activities occurs, then leakage
will be calculated using equation 5 of AR-AM0014 and equations 1, 2 and 3 of AR-TOOL15.
3.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
Net GHG removals by sink are calculated using the following equation of AR-AM0014:
ΔC = ΔC - ΔC - LK (Equation 21, 6 of AR-AM0014) ARR-VCS,t ACTUAL,t BLS,t ,t
Where:
ΔC = Net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t CO -e ARR-VCS,t 2
ΔC = Actual net GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t CO -e ACTUAL,t 2
ΔC = Baseline net GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t CO -e BLS,t 2
LK = GHG emissions due to leakage, in year t; t CO -e ,t 2
Ex ante estimations of the net GHG removals by sinks in the first project activity instance are
described in the following table.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
According to the A/R Methodological tool “Estimation of the increase in GHG emissions
attributable to displacement of pre-project agricultural activities in A/R CDM project activity”,
leakage emission resulting from displacement of the activities is composed of decrease in carbon
stock in the carbon pools of the land and change in soil organic carbon stock due to land-use
change in the land.
44 LK = ×(ΔC +ΔSOC )40
AGRIC,t 12 BIOMASS,t LUC,t
Where:
LK = Leakage due to the displacement of agricultural activities in
AGRIC,t year t; tCO -e 2
ΔC = Decrease in carbon stock in the carbon pools of the land
BIOMASS,t receiving the activity displaced in year t; t d.m
ΔSOC = Change in soil organic carbon (SOC) stock due to land-use
LUC,t change in the land receiving the displaced activity in year t; tC
ha
The project was implemented by manual operation, rather than mechanical operation. Besides,
no weeding, chopping, pruning, intermediate cutting activities are going to be conducted during
the crediting period because of the natural condition, the economic condition and the slow growth
pattern. Fertilization and watering are not going to take place, neither.41 Therefore, there is no
expected leakage due to decrease in carbon stock in the carbon pools of the land and change in
soil organic carbon stock. In other words, there is no expected leakage due to the displacement
of agricultural activity from the project activity.
Therefore, leakage is zero for the proposed project.
3.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
The net anthropogenic GHG removals by the project shall be calculated as follows:
∆𝐶 = ∆𝐶 −∆𝐶 −𝐿𝐾 (1) !"",! !""#$!%,! !""#,! !
Where:
∆𝐶 !"",! = Net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t CO 2-e
∆𝐶 !""#$!%,! = Actual net GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t CO 2-e
∆𝐶 !""#,! = Baseline net GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t CO 2-e
𝐿𝐾 ! = GHG emissions due to leakage, in year t; t CO 2-e
From the previous calculation on baseline emissions and leakage emissions, we learn that
estimated baseline emissions is 6,662.75tCO e for the project, and estimated leakage emissions 2

4.3.1.2. GHG emissions by sources increased as result of project activity
GHG emissions as a result of project activities will be calculated according to the
approved methodology. The project takes into account the increase in emissions of
GHG gases resulting from use of fossil fuel, biomass loss and the use of fertilizer.
Fossil fuel combustion, for instance, occurs during thinning and harvesting activities,
but the methodology excludes transportation fuel.
where:
GHG Annual GHG emissions as result of the implementation of the A/R project activity within the E,t project boundary; tonnes CO-e yr-1 in year t 2 E CO emissions from combustion of fossil fuels within the project boundary; tonnes CO-e yr-1 FuelBurn,t 2 2
in year t
E GHG emissions from the loss of biomass in site preparation and conversion to A/R within the BiomassLoss,t project boundary; tonnes CO-e yr-1 in year t 2
E Non-CO2 emission as a result of biomass burning within the project boundary; tonnes CO-e Non- 2 yr-1 in year t CO2,BiomassBurn,t
T Ranges from 1 to end of crediting period; years
The project participants assume that a small amount of GHG emissions will result
from site preparation and plantation management activities. However, the proposed
A/R project activity does not engage in any burning practices during site preparation.
Further, conversion of herbaceous vegetation can be neglected, and the loss of GHG
sequestered in woody biomass will not occur since trees and shrubs will not be
removed.
However, for the project participants, it is a difficult task to estimate ex ante GHG
emissions with a high degree of accuracy. To maintain a conservative approach for
the ex-ante calculation, the proposed A/R project activity applies a default 10%
project GHG emission value based on the CO2-e stock in living biomass of trees in
the project scenario However, this value will probably be adjusted during the
verification process.

4.3.2. Leakage
See 9 Baseline Report (Step 8), and 10 Monitoring (7. Monitoring leakage).
The methodology AR-AM0005 considers two sources of leakage:
LK = LK +LK
t Displacement_grazing,t Fuelwood,t
where:
LK Increase of GHG emissions outside the project boundary; tonnes CO-e yr-1 in year t t 2
LK Increase of GHG emissions outside the project boundary resulting from displacement of Displacement_grazing,t grazing activities; tonnes CO-e yr-1 in year t 2
LK Increase of GHG emissions outside the project boundary resulting from displacement of fuel Fuelwood,t wood collection; tonnes CO-e yr-1 in year t 2
T Ranges from 1 to end of crediting period; years
However, the displacement of grazing activities to other grasslands (without
overgrazing) does not result in leakage. Generally it is assumed that grazing activities
continue to be executed in an extensive manner within the project boundaries and
commercial animal farming is not present. Hence, leakage from displacement of
grazing activities is considered to be zero:
Further, there is no collection of firewood in the baseline scenario of the project area.
Therefore, this variable is set to zero:
139 Project emissions are estimated to be a percentage of the estimated accumulated tCO2e sequestered through the
A/R project activity.

5.5 LEAKAGE (CL2)
As the baseline scenario is primarily driven by illegal commercial logging there is potential activity –shifting and
market-effects leakage. As identified by the timber study, the activity-shifting leakage is geographically
constrained by proximity to transportation routes and accessibility.
5.5.1 ESTIMATING EMISSIONS FROM LEAKAGE
Emissions from leakage are quantified two approaches for the purposes of ex-ante estimates. First, leakage is
quantified by defining a leakage area and adjusting baseline rates of deforestation and degradation in the leakage
area using leakage cancellation rates. And second, by making reasonable assumptions about the proportion of
merchantable biomass in the project region based on the results of the timber study to apply a conservative
market-effects leakage discount. The first approach is summarized in Section 5.5.2 while the second in Section
5.5.5. All calculations are provided in VM0006 Accounting ACAPA-BMF v10.15.xlsm.
For the purposes of ex-post estimates, the leakage area is monitored for increases in deforestation and
degradation relative to predicted baseline levels. The market-effects discount factor is applied until the time of
baseline reassessment.
5.5.2 ESTIMATE LEAKAGE FROM GEOGRAPHICALLY CONSTRAINED DRIVERS
Ex-ante leakage from geographically unconstrained drivers is estimated by estimating the leakage-induced increase
in deforestation and degradation rates as a result of project activities and then adding this increase to the
predicted baseline rates of deforestation and degradation for the leakage area. The baseline rates of deforestation
and degradation are presented in Section 5.3.5 while the leakage-induced increase is described in Section 5.5.2.1.

BE = EG , * EF (1) y PJ y grid, CM, y
Where:
BE : Baseline emissions in year y (tCO e/yr) y 2
EG : Quantity of net electricity generation that is produced and fed into the grid as a PJ, y
result of the implementation of the CDM project activity in year y (MWh/yr)
EF : Combined margin CO emission factor for grid connected power generation in grid, CM, y 2
year y calculated using the latest version of the “Tool to calculate the emission
factor for an electricity system” (tCO e/MWh) 2
Thus, BE = EG , * EF y PJ y grid, CM, y
BE = 368,856 (MWh)* 0.99 tCO /MWh y 2
BE = 364,244 tCO y 2
Project Emissions
As per the para 36 of methodology ACM 0002 (Version 17.0), “For most renewable power
generation project activities, PE = 0. y
Leakage Emissions
As per para 5.6 of the methodology ACM 0002 (Version 17.0) does not consider any leakage
emissions.
Emission reductions
As per equation number (17) of the applied methodology, emission reductions are calculated as
follows:
ER = BE – PE (7) y y y
Where:
ER Emission reductions in year y (tCO e/yr) y 2
BE Baseline emissions in year y (tCO e/yr) y 2
PE Project emissions in year y (tCO e/yr) y 2
Thus, ER = 364,244 – 0 tCO y 2
= 364,244 tCO 2

Where
PD = Power density of the project activity, in W/m2
Cap = Installed capacity of the hydro power plant after the implementation of the PJ
project activity (W)
Cap = Installed capacity of the hydro power plant before the implementation of the BL
project activity (W). For new hydro power plants, this value is zero.
A = Area of the reservoir measured in the surface of the water, after the PJ
implementation of the project activity, when the reservoir is full (m2).
A = Area of the reservoir measured in the surface of the water, before the BL
implementation of the project activity, when the reservoir is full (m2). For new
reservoirs, this value is zero.
According to FSR, the installed capacity of the project (Cap ) is 65,000,000W and the increased PJ
submerged area of the project ( A PJ ) was measured to be 147,300m2 , thus the power density of
the project is calculated as (65,000,000 – 0) / (147,300 – 0)= 441 W/m2, greater than 10W/m2.

CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3
In sum, Scenario 3 is not feasible. Scenario 1, continuation of pre-project use (i.e. lands remain
barren), remains the possible baseline scenario.
STEP 3. Investment analysis (if needed)
Scenario 1 remains the only possible baseline scenario, which makes investment analysis not
necessary.
STEP 4. Common practice analysis
Different from forestry in other provinces, forest in Qinghai Province is mainly non-commercial
forest.14 Therefore Qinghai Province where the project located is selected as common practice
boundary.
According to Qinghai Forest Department, there were no other afforestation project on a scale
similar with the proposed project have been implemented previously except one project
“Reforestation Project in Qinghai Province 2012” which has been also registered as a VCS
project in 2015.
And there are two other similar projects currently underway in Xining City separately which are
also under development as VCS&CCB project implemented by the same project proponent.
Therefore, there is no similar afforestation activity identified within the common practice boundary,
so step 4 is satisfied.
Thus, the proposed project is not a common practice and the proposed afforestation project
activity is not the baseline scenario which is additional.
3.1.5 Additionality
The additionality has been demonstrated in the above section 3.1.4.
3.1.6 Methodology Deviations
N/A.
3.2 Quantification of GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
3.2.1 Baseline Emissions
Baseline net GHG removals by sinks
As described above, the baseline scenario is the continuation of existing land use i.e. lands
remain barren. Based on the applied methodology AR-ACM0003 (Version 2.0.0), the baseline net
GHG removals by sinks is estimated as follows:

According to the methodology, the emissions considered occur in two ways:
• Through the burning of fossil fuel during the establishment practices, forest management and
explotation
• Burning of biomass or wood
The increase in emissions is defined by equation 100 of methodology AR-AM0004 / Version 03, as shown
below:

This component considers all plant material of the herbaceous and shrub-like type which is eliminated during
the establishment stages of the forest plantations: For the project conditions, the elimination of some coffee
shrubs in order to incorporate the forest system is estimated. The steps to be followed in the quantification of
emissions according to the methodology are:
Step 1: Estimate the amount of biomass removed. Said estimate is made in systems with existing non-woody
or shrub-like vegetation and for the pasture lands the maximum stock present is considered, in order to be
conservative. For coffee plantations it is carried out by counting the coffee trees eliminated per tree unit of
the tree stand model incorporated. The number of coffee trees removed is variable, given that their planting
density in the region ranges from 6,000 to 10,000 trees/ha. The biomass estimate per individual unit is carried
out through equations generated for the region are based on existing equations from the scientific literature
with data from the area51.
Step 2: Estimate the average biomass proportion harvested (with the information and procedures of step 1)
and apply the respective GHG emission factor. The emission factors established in Tables 3.A 15 and 3.A.16
of the IPCC GPG-LULUCF will be used.
Step 3: Estimating of GHG emissions resulted from the slash and burn based on revised IPCC 1996

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
VCS Version 3, CCB Standards Third Edition
Monitoring the reduction in carbon storage and increase in GHG emissions due to leakage of
displacement:
Procedures for control and quality assurance will be used the same applied to the monitoring of
deforestation in the Project area (section 1.2).
e) Data archiving
2.1. Monitoring of changes in carbon stocks and GHG emissions associated with the leak
prevention activities.
The following activities in leakage management areas may occasionally cause decrease in
carbon stock or increase in GHG emissions:
 Changes in carbon stock due to activities implemented in the areas of leakage management;
 According to the most recent VCS standard emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) derived from

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
PD = Power density of the project activity (W/m2)
Cap = Installed capacity of the hydro power plant after the implementation of the project activity PJ
(W)
Cap = Installed capacity of the hydro power plant before the implementation of the project activity BL
(W). For new hydro power plants, this value is zero
A = Area of the reservoir measured in the surface of the water, after the implementation of the PJ
project activity, when the reservoir is full (m2)
A = Area of the reservoir measured in the surface of the water, before the implementation of the BL
project activity, when the reservoir is full (m2). For new reservoirs, this value is
zero
Since the project activity has no reservoir, this step is not required and the project emissions are zero:
PE = 0 y
3.3 Leakage
No leakage emissions are considered as provided in the methodology:
LE = 0 y
3.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
Since project emissions and leakage emissions are zero, emission reductions are directly given as the
baseline emissions as follows:
ER =BE -PE -LE =BE (8)
y y y y y
Where:
ER = Emission reductions in year y (tCO e/yr) y 2
BE = Baseline emissions in year y (tCO /yr) y 2
PE = Project emissions in year y (tCO e/yr) y 2
PE = Project emissions in year y (tCO e/yr) y 2
Thus: ER = 99,992 tCO /yr y 2

traded as carbon credits to cover potential carbon loss in the case that the permanence of the
plantations or the project is not ensured. To estimate the non-permanence risk and the buffer to
be discounted, the “AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool” was used. For the first instance, the
analysis resulted in a buffer value of 0.14232.
6.4. Leakage
The leakage for the monitoring period from November 18th, 2016 to May 14th, 2021 is considered
zero given the following conditions:
1. Agricultural baseline: The agricultural activities carried out within the Flor Cue property did not
continue. Additionally, farmers were not affected since they were working in the land under
leasing contracts and the change of activity took place long after their termination.
2. Livestock baseline: Emissions leakage attributable to the displacement of grazing activities are
considered insignificant (zero) because the following condition referenced in the tool
“Estimation of the increase in GHG emissions attributable to displacement of pre-project
agricultural activities in A/R CDM project activity” is met:
● Animals are displaced to existing grazing land and the total number of animals in the
receiving grazing land (displaced and existing) does not exceed the carrying capacity of the
grazing land (section 4.3).
6.5. Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
The net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks will be calculated based on the information
previously estimated and equation 5 of the AR-ACM0003 methodology:
∆𝐶 =∆𝐶 −∆𝐶 −𝐿𝐾 𝐴𝑅−𝐶𝐷𝑀,𝑡 𝐴𝐶𝑇𝑈𝐴𝐿,𝑡 𝐵𝐷𝐿,𝑡 𝑡

4.3 Leakage
Leakage emission shall be estimated as follows:
𝐿𝐾 = 𝐿𝐾 Where: 𝑡 𝐴𝐺𝑅𝐼𝐶,𝑡
LK = GHG emissions due to leakage, in year t; t ,t CO2-e
LK = Leakage due to the displacement of agricultural activities in year t, as AGRIC,t
estimated in the tool “Estimation of the increase in GHG emissions
attributable to displacement of pre-project agricultural activities in A/R
CDM project activity”; t CO2-e
In the project area there is no agricultural or any other kind of activity implemented, hence, no
leakage is foreseen. So as far as our project activities:
LK=0 t
4.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
The net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks shall be calculated as follows:
∆𝐶 = ∆𝐶 −∆𝐶 −𝐿𝐾 Equation (7) 𝐴𝑅,𝑡 𝐴𝐶𝑇𝑈𝐴𝐿,𝑡 𝐵𝑆𝐿,𝑡 𝑡
Where:
ΔC = Net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks, in yeart; t AR,t CO2-e

ΔC = Baseline net GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t BSL,t CO2-e
LK = GHG emissions due to leakage, in year t; t ,t CO2-e
As stated in the previous sections, baseline emissions, as well as emissions due to leakage, are
accounted as zero.

1.8 Description of the Project Activity
The Project will use carbon financing to protect the forest and avoid harvesting of the forest for the
valuable timber and conversion to agriculture. The primary methods employed to achieve the desired
result is maintaining and increasing a robust presence both at the main facility and implementing regular
patrols of the property to prevent incursions and illegal logging. In addition, an integrated monitoring
program that addresses both carbon and biodiversity will be implemented to insure permanence for the
climate and biodiversity benefits. Furthermore, the need to staff the facility, patrol the forest and river and
monitor the forest biomass and biodiversity will require hiring and training of additional staff from the local
community of Puerto Miguel. Finally, Yacumama management will be able to continue supporting health

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
6. According to Candel et al. (2006)43, the carrying capacity in semi-arid tropic regions of India is
estimated as 1.024 LUs per ha which is slightly higher than the status of LUs per ha in the
project. Moreover, this carrying capacity is very conservative for the project area being moist
tropical condition with significantly higher dry matter production than semi-arid lands.
Therefore leakage emission attributable to the displacement of grazing activities is considered
insignificant in this project.
3.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
The ex-ante net anthropogenic GHG emission reductions and removals are calculated using
equation 5 of the methodology. The results for this project are shown below.

6.4 Leakage
No leakage emissions are considered. The main emissions potentially giving rise to leakage
in the context of electric sector projects are emissions arising due to activities such as power
plant construction and upstream emissions from fossil fuel use (e.g. extraction, processing,

The emission reductions estimated in the PDD were 1,428,041 tCO e (727,982 2
tCO e/365d*716d) during this monitoring period. The actual emission reductions in this 2
monitoring period (716days) were 1,535,574 tCO e, the actual emission reductions in this 2
monitoring period are 7.00% more than the estimation in the registered PDD. The higher
electricity exported has no impact on the additionally of the project activity as the sensitivity
analysis of the project activity shows that the IRR will not exceeds benchmark until an 8.2%
increase in Grid-connected electricity.

fire, in year t; t CO2e
Emission of non-CO2 GHGs resulting from the loss of dead organic matter due to fire is calculated using the
dead organic matter stock.
However, since PP has selected not to account for the dead organic matter pool, the dead organic matter
stock shall be considered zero and non-CO2 GHG emissions from fire are not accounted.
Therefore, ex-ante emission of non-CO2 GHGs resulting from burning of biomass and forest fires = zero

5 MONITORING
5.1 Data and Parameters Available at Validation
Monitoring will be organised according to Section 06 of the AR-ACM0003 (Version 02.0). All the data
mentioned in this section will be collected and archived electronically and kept for 2 years after the end of
the last crediting period.
Project Boundary
Keeping records of the project boundary is one of the most important activities during monitoring. The
geographic coordinates of the project boundary and all stratifications within the project have been
established and will be recorded. Field surveys using GPS, satellite images and land use maps have been
used in this activity.
This activity will be done throughout the project period to ensure there are no errors in the definition of the
project boundary. The project participant has a GIS Expert who will be coordinating this activity. He has
knowledge to recording proper boundaries of the project.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1.8 Description of the Project Activity
The Recast Energy Louisville biomass project (hereafter, the “project activity”) is a thermal energy
generation project fuelled with locally available urban, forestry, and agricultural cellulosic residues
(i.e. primary mill residues, logging residues, clean pallets, tree care and landscape trimmings,
right-of-way maintenance, driftwood, and crop residues). The thermal energy from the biomass
system displaces thermal energy previously generated for the customers (Lubrizol and Zeon) by
OxyVinyls, L.P., and subsequently by Recast Energy Louisville, LLC, after the purchase of the
thermal energy plant from OxyVinyls by way of Lubrizol.
The Project Activity consists of converting an existing coal fired boiler built in 1981 to a biomass
fired boiler that will continue to provide thermal energy to the project customers. The biomass
boiler will be the predominant thermal energy source for the customers. Supplemental thermal
energy will be provided by natural gas boilers during periods when the biomass boiler cannot
meet full demand load.
The biomass is generated generally within a wood basket that has an abundant supply of
biomass feedstock potential. The wood basket encompasses a one hour drive time from the
project site (the “Target Feedstock Area”). On a case by case basis, some biomass may be
sourced up to two hour drive time. Within the Target Feedstock Area, an estimated 2.743,000
million short tons of green (wet) biomass is generated annually. The project is expected to
consume between 75,000 and 100,000 green tons per year based on historical thermal energy
demand.
Aside from displacing greenhouse gases from fossil fuels, the project activity also has an
economic benefit for the local community. A large portion of the biomass fuel used in the project
activity was previously unused and unsellable material, which generally remained in the field and
forest to decay or was landfilled. As a result of the project activity, the economy of the entire area
has benefitted through job creation in the collecting, processing and transport of materials. The
project activity creates roughly 30 permanent green collar jobs: 14 in plant and approximately 12
to 20 upstream in the fuel supply chain.
Although the project activity has the capacity to supply the project customer’s typical annual
steam load, the project proponent elects to maintain a natural gas boiler system as redundant
backup. When the biomass system is not able to meet the real-time full load, additional load is

emissions and the project emissions and project leakage. The table below shows the net
emissions reductions estimated during the project crediting period; actual annual emissions
reductions are expected to be within 25% of these estimates, varying primarily as the project
customer’s demand for steam varies. The start of each year commences on January 1.

4.4, below.
4.3 Leakage
For ex-post leakage, the methodology requires the monitoring of cropland, domesticated grazing
animals and domesticated roaming animals displaced by the project activity during the first
crediting period. If the indicators were less than 10%, leakage is set to zero. The monitoring
results provided in the PD indicated cropland and grazing leakage is below the thresholds that
require further monitoring and that the ex-post leakage can be set at zero.
4.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
The net GhG emissions reductions can be found in column AW, ""PA Summary"" worksheet. It
reflects the emission reductions calculated from the ""Ex-Post Strata"" worksheet, less the Pending

CCB + VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION
CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3
peat dams to block existing canals, we expect that no ecological leakage will occur in the project scenario.
We will monitor the effectiveness of rewetting activities to confirm that no ecological leakage is occurring at
each monitoring event. Monitoring of ecological leakage will take place by installing monitoring dip wells
within the vicinity of canal block positions inside and bordering the project area (see details in Annex 8).
3.2.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
This section provides an overview of total net emission reductions and details activity specific calculations
in the subsections. We calculated Net GHG emission reductions as the sum of total net GHG emission
reductions of the WRC project activity and total net GHG removals of the ARR project activity (39):

3.2.4.1 Uncertainty analysis
Using Module X-UNC as a guideline, we calculated WRC uncertainty of the SMPP in both the baseline and
project scenarios. Our project does not have a REDD component, so REDD uncertainty calculations were
not necessary. We modified the X-UNC equation (21) to the following equation (40):

organic carbon (DOC) from water bodies in the baseline and project scenarios, using the standard error
data from the peat emission factors in the IPCC Wetlands Supplement 2013 (see Annex 11).53 We
established that CH4 emission uncertainty was zero, as it was conservatively excluded from our emission
calculations. We also established that uncertainty from GHG emissions from peat burning was also zero in
the project scenario, as we assumed full fire prevention in the project area. However, we calculated
uncertainty from GHG emissions from peat burning in the baseline using the dry mass burnt per stratum
per year and their standard deviations converted to 95% confidence intervals. We combined emissions
data from CO2 and CH4 burning to produce an overall uncertainty in CO2 equivalent, because Module X-
UNC does not distinguish between these emissions.
We calculated the uncertainty for WRC as 34.79% and 22.29% for the years 2016 and 2017, respectively
in the baseline scenario. In the project scenario the uncertainty was calculated as 1.99% and 1.41%, for
2016 and 2017, respectively. This resulted in a total error in this project activity at 26.12% and 17.03, for
2016 and 2017, respectively. Assuming a threshold of 15% uncertainty, we deducted the VCUs for 2016
and 2017 by 11.12% and 2.03%, respectively. Further details on all calculations are provided in Annex 14.
3.2.4.2 Total net GHG emission reductions of WRC project activity
We calculated net GHG emission reductions related to WRC project activities by subtracting project
emissions and emissions due to leakage from baseline emissions (see Table 55).

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
As no displacement of agricultural production from within the project boundary occurs as a result of the
project activities, leakage emissions are considered to be zero for the life of the project.
4.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
The net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks are calculated as follows:
C C -C -LKt (Equation 7) AR-CDM ,t = ACTUAL,t BSL,t
where:
C =Net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks, in year t; tCO -e AR CDM ,t 2
C =Actual net GHG removals by sinks, in year t; tCO -e ACTUAL,t 2
C =Baseline net GHG removals by sinks, in year t; tCO -e BSL,t 2
LKt =GHG emissions due to leakage, in year t; tCO -e 2
Since baseline removals and emissions due to leaks were considered zero, net anthropogenic removals are
expressed according to the formula:
C C -C AR-CDM ,t = ACTUAL,t BSL,t
Project proponent applied a discount of a reserve of 10% to cover the aspects related to the risk of non-
permanence. The complete non-permanence risk analysis can be referred from the non-permanence risk
report.
Calculation of LA
According to the standard requirements, for those projects where harvesting practices is contemplated on
project activities, the loss of carbon due to harvesting shall be include in the quantification of the project
emissions. Due to the project activities contemplate an increment on project area with different rotation
periods per species the long-term average (LTA) GHG benefit was calculated as follows according to VCS
Standard:
Where:
LA The long-term average GHG benefit
PEt The total to-date GHG emission reductions and removals generated in the project scenario
(tCO2e). Project scenario emission reductions and removals shall also consider project emissions of CO₂,
N₂O, CH4 and leakage.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1.8 Description of the Project Activity
The Nam Chim Hydro Power Project activity involves the construction and operation of Nam
Chim 1 hydropower plant which is located on Nam Chim stream in Xim Vang commune, Bac Yen
district, Son La province, Vietnam.
The project activity generates renewable power with negligible greenhouse gases (GHG)
emissions, which displaces part of the electricity otherwise supplied by mainly fossil fuel fired
power plants. The project involves construction of a reservoir with an area5 of 18 ha and a power
density of 88.9 W/m2, accordingly. As the power density of this project is above 10 W/m2, GHG
emissions from the reservoir need not to be accounted in the project activity. Thus, this project
activity generates GHG emission reductions up to a total expected CO emission reduction of 2
80,244 tCO over the first crediting period of 2 years and three months 2
The project involves the construction of a two-generating unit hydropower plant which has new
hydro turbines and generators in order to convert potential energy available in the river flow into
clean electrical energy (without GHG emission) which is supplying to the national grid at the
connection point through the transmission line. The power metering systems are installed at the
connection point. They are digital and bi-direction type to measure the export and import
electricity of Nam Chim 1 hydropower plant.
The main equipment utilized in this project was imported from India. The project owner chose
suppliers via tender. The tender documents had set criteria for supplier to ensure that the turbines
and alternators are environmentally safe and sound technology.
The project activity will achieve GHG emission reduction by displacing power generated by fossil
fuel fired plants connected to the national grid. For CDM project activity, the crediting period will
be applied for a seven-year crediting period, renewable twice up to a total of 21 years

⚫ Guangxi Huanjiang IFM (conversion of logged to protected forest) Project activity is located in
Huanjiang Maonan Autonomous County, Hechi City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China.
Theannualmeantemperatureof the southern hills is 19.9 ℃ and the northern mountainous area is
15.7℃.The annual mean precipitation of the southern area is 1389.1 mm and the northern area is
1750.0 mm.
⚫ The project activity includes the Improved Forest Management (IFM) of the forests in 1,306
subcompartments spreading over Huashan forest farm, Chuanshan Town, Dongxing Town, Luoyang
Town, Minglun Town, Shuiyuan Town, Si’en Town, Da’an Township, Lonyan Township, Tiancai Township,
Xianan Township, Xunle Township, Changmei Township of Huanjiang Maonan Autonomous County by
the conversion of logged to protected forest. All the subcompartments had the legal right to harvest
issued by local forest bureau before the implementation of the project activity. Before 2016, they were
all forests which the trees could be logged and sold once reached the cutting rotation age based on
a timber harvest plan. After 01-July-2016, they are all converted to protected forests.
⚫ Huanjiang Maonan Autonomous County Huashan Forestry Investment Co., Ltd and Guangzhou
Guangtan Carbon Emission Development & Investment Co., Ltd together have overall control
responsibility for the project. The latter is also in charge of applying VCS project.
⚫ The purpose of strata is to improve accuracy and reduce the sampling cost. The strata is usually based
on the tree species, age and canopy density, but it does not mean all these factors should be
considered for all projects, more strata means more workload and cost. For this project, the factor of
species for strata could reduce the variation within the same stratum and reach the accuracy level of
90% under certain degree of freedom. So the strata are reasonable and feasible.
⚫ All the subcompartments are divided into 3 strata based on the tree species.
⚫ The implementation of the project activity includes the conversion from logged to protected forests in
the parcels mentioned above. After the activity, trees could be avoided to be logged and then the

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
3.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
The determination of which GHG emissions by sources, decreases in carbon pools, and leakage
emissions are significant for this Project Activity has been carried out using the “Tool for testing
significance of GHG emissions in A/R CDM project activities (Version 01)”. According to the tool,
the GHG emissions by sources, decreases in carbon pools and leakage emissions are all
considered significant, as their sums represent more than 5% of net emission reductions.
3.4.1 Calculation of ex-ante estimation of total net GHG emissions reductions
The net anthropogenic GHG emission reduction (STEP 9) of the proposed AUD project activity is
calculated as follows:
REDD = (CBSLPA + EBBBSLPA) – (CPSPA + EBBPSPA) – (CLK + ELK) t t t t t t t
Where:
REDD Ex ante estimated net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission reduction t
attributable to the AUD project activity at year t; tCO e 2
CBSLPA Sum of baseline carbon stock changes in the project area at year t; tCO e t 2
Note: The absolute values of CBSLPA shall be used in equation above. t
EBBBSLPA Sum of baseline emissions from biomass burning in the project area at year t; t
tCO e 2
CPSPA Sum of ex ante estimated actual carbon stock changes in the project area at year t
t; tCO e 2
Note: If CPSPA represents a net increase in carbon stocks, a negative sign before the absolute t
value of CPSPA shall be used. If CPSPA represents a net decrease, the positive sign shall be t t
used.
EBBPSPA Sum of (ex ante estimated) actual emissions from biomass burning in the project t
area at year t; tCO e 2
CLK Sum of ex ante estimated leakage net carbon stock changes at year t; tCO e t 2
Note: If the cumulative sum of CLK within a fixed baseline period is > 0, CLK shall be set to zero. t t
ELK Sum of ex ante estimated leakage emissions at year t; tCO e t 2

3.4.2 Calculation of ex-ante Verified Carbon Units (VCUs)
The number of Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) to be generated through the proposed AUD project
activity at year t is calculated as follows:
VCU = REDD – VBC t t t
VBC = (CBSLPA - CPSPA) * RF t t t t
Where:
VCU Number of Verified Carbon Units that can be traded at time t; t CO2-e t

Data collection procedures are the same as described in previous steps. This step involves
compilation of data from previous procedures to calculate ex post net anthropogenic GHG
emission reduction.
d) Quality control and quality assurance procedures.
A map showing Cumulative Areas Credited within the project area shall be updated and presented
to VCS verifiers at each verification event. The cumulative area cannot generate additional VCUs
in future periods.
e) Data archiving.
All maps and records generated during project implementation will be conserved and made
available to VCS verifiers at verification for inspection to demonstrate that the AUD project activity
has actually been implemented.
All documents and records will be kept in a secure retrievable manner for at least two years after

⚫ According to the 13th Five-year Forest Harvest Limit issued by State Council (Guohan [2016] No.32)11,
the total harvest volume limit from 2016 to 2020 is 25,403.6*104 m3, and annual forest logging
quota during the ""14th Five-Year Plan"" period issued by Notice of the General Office of the Hubei
Provincial People's Government (Hubei Provincial Government Office (2021) No. 4)3"", the total
harvest volume limit from 2021 to 2025 is 1013.1*104 m3. The planned harvest volume of the
project in 2018-2020 and 2021-2022 is 38.9*104 m3 and12*104 m3, accounting 0.02% and 1.18%
of the national harvest volume, respectively, which will not result in the significant national
concession and illegal logging; Regulations of the People's Republic of China on forestry law Article
38 and Article 39 clearly stipulates the punishment for the illegal logging. According to the volume
and quantity of illegal logging, punishment includes not only 5-10 times compensation of replanting,
but also 2-10 times economic penalty.
⚫ The annual extracted volume is unlikely increase within existing national concessions AND illegal
logging is strictly forbidden and will be severely punished by the law.
In summary, LF = 0 ME
The actual value will be monitored when verification.

4.4.2 Project Verified Carbon Units
The number of Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) for each year t in the project crediting period is the
greenhouse gas emission reductions and removals adjusted for uncertainty and risk.
Adjustment for uncertainty
Estimated greenhouse gas emissions and emission reductions from IFM activities have uncertainties
associated with parameters and coefficients including estimates of area, carbon stocks, regrowth and
expansion factors. It is assumed that the uncertainties associated with input data are available, either
as default uncertainty values given in most recent IPCC guidelines, or as statistical estimates based on
sampling.
Uncertainty at all times is defined at the 95% confidence interval where the estimated variance exceeds
+/- 15 percent from the mean. Procedures including stratification and the allocation of sufficient
measurement plots will help ensure that low uncertainty results and ultimately full crediting can result.
Uncertainties arising from the measurement and monitoring of carbon pools and greenhouse gases
shall always be quantified. Errors in each pool shall be weighted by the size of the pool so that projects
may reasonably target a lower precision level in pools that only form a small proportion of the total
stock.
For both the baseline and the with-project case the total uncertainty is equal to the square root of the
sum of the squares of each component uncertainty and is calculated at the time of reporting through
propagating the error in the baseline stocks and the error in the project stocks.
Therefore, total uncertainty for LtPF project is calculated as:

Where:
U total uncertainty for LtPF Project, dimensionless; total|LtPF
U total uncertainty for the improved forest management activities in |PRJ
