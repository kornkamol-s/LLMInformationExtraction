Wind power is one of the cleanest sources of renewable energy, with no
associated emissions and waste products. As per the Schedule 1 of Ministry
of Environment and Forests (Government of India) notification9 dated
September 14, 2006, wind power projects do not require an Environmental
Impact Assessment. However, certain foreseen impacts due to the project
activity are discussed below:
Noise Pollution
Most of the wind turbines are in isolated areas or on designated wind zones
and hence do not cause any concern to the residents of the area. In the same
vein, construction activities also have not caused noise pollution due to the
isolated nature of the area.
Water Pollution
There is no gaseous, liquid or solid effluent from the Wind Turbine
Generators. Hence there is no contamination of water bodies due to
operation of Wind Turbine Generators.
Air Pollution
Minimal air pollution might have occurred during the construction of the
Project due to transportation. However, these were not found to affect the
surrounding persons nor the environment in any significant manner. Wind

energy plants are known to contribute to zero atmospheric pollution as no
fuel combustion is involved during any stage of the operation.
Hence it can be concluded that there are no negative impacts associated
with the mentioned Project.
5 Environmental Impact:
The project activity is a clean energy project using renewable source of
energy, wind, to generate power. It has already received permission from
Maharashtra Energy Development Agency (MEDA) which is a department

Determination of EF BL, c
However, the baseline emission factor for continuously flooded fields without organic
amendments (EF ) can be determined ex-ante prior to the start of the project activity, in this BL, c
case, the ex-ante value should be used to calculate emission reduction during the crediting
period. It should be measured by using Closed Chamber in three reference fields which are
chosen in the project area.
According to the guidance on methane measurement in the appendix of AMS-III.AU Methodology,
the implementation of methane measurement in rice fields requires the involvement of experts
in this field or at least experienced staff trained by experts (i.e., from research institutions). These
guidelines cannot replace expertise in setting up chamber measurements. They rather set
minimum requirements that serve for standardizing the conditions under which methane
emissions are measured for projects under this methodology.
1) The Closed Chamber measurement requires the cooperation of the experts from Huazhong
Agricultural University and the staff of the Agricultural Bureau of Qianxi City and Agricultural
Bureau of Jinsha County. Huazhong Agricultural University is an institution of higher learning
of agriculture in China. The experts set up the chamber measurements on 10-April-2017. The
base is embedded just before transplanting, and the first gas sampling began on the second
day after transplanting, followed by sampling every 7 days. After sampling, as is stored in the
evacuated vial, and the samples collected after three times should be taken together for
laboratory analysis.
2) Project proponent shall prepare a detailed plan for the seasonal methane measurements
before the start of the season. The plan shall include the schedule for the field and laboratory
measurements, the logistics that are necessary to get the gas samples to the laboratory and
a cropping calendar. The plan shall also include all reference field specific information
14 For all scaling factor used in this methodology, the average values in 2006 IPCC Guidelines for
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories are chosen.

Soil organic carbon
Estimations of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks were done in accordance to the “Tool for the estimation of
change in soil organic carbon stocks due to the implementation of A/R CDM project activity”. As suggested
by the tool, it is assumed that the implementation of the project activity increases the SOC content of the
lands from the pre-project level to the level that is equal to the steady-state SOC content under native
vegetation. The increase in SOC content in the project scenario takes place at a constant rate over a period
of 20 years from the year of planting. The project meets the applicability conditions of this tool since:
 the areas of land to which the tool is applied do not fall into wetland category, do not contain organic
soils and are not subject to any of the land management practices and application of inputs listed
in Tables 1 and 2 of the tool;
 Since the land use prior to project start is grassland, only Table 2 applies. For the temperate warm
moist climate region corresponding to the project activity, none of the three combinations included
in Table 2 are applicable;
 litter remains on site and is not removed and soil disturbance is in accordance with appropriate
conservation practices, limited to site preparation and not repeated within 20 years.
Table 13. Parameters used for estimation of SOC
SOC at the beginning of the project (SOC ) is estimated by multiplying the factors in Table 13 by the INITIAL,i
reference SOC. As per the tool, a loss in SOC (SOC ) is applied in the case that soil disturbance occurs LOSS,i

Where,
BE - Base Line Emission for the year ‘y’ y
ER - Emission reductions for the year ‘y’ y
PE - Project Emissions for the year ‘y’ y
L - Leakage for the year ‘y’ y
The emission reductions will be calculated based of actual net electricitysupplied to the

5 Environmental Impact:
As per the prevailing local /host country laws no environmental impact assessment is
required, (the Schedule 1 of Ministry of Environment and Forests (Government of
India) notification dated September 14, 2006), 38 activities are required to undertake
environmental impact assessment studies. The details of these activities are available at
http://envfor.nic.in/legis/eia/so1533.pdf.
However the project participant has carried out Aspect and Impact analysis of all the
activities of the project and concluded that there is no negative environmental impact
due to the project activity and wind energy is one of the cleanest sources of energy.

3.4 Summary of GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
Ex-ante calculation of emission reductions:
Simple Operating margin (OM)
As also explained above, for the computation of the Simple OM, the Ex-Ante option is selected, at the
time of PDD submission to the DOE, the data vintages that were most recent, belongs to the years
2008, 2009 and 2010. All the data used in calculation of the Simple OM are taken from the TEİAŞ
website, details of which are given below. Taking into account the available data “Simple OM” method
“Option B” is the appropriate method for the project activity. TEİAŞ publishes the annual heating
values of the fuels consumed in the power plants, the heating values are directly related to fuel
consumption and are used to calculate average Net Calorific Values (TJ/kt) (Table 10).
The heating values of fuels consumed in thermal power plants are announced by TEİAŞ, the unit of
the heating values are Tcal. Tcal is converted to GJoule by using the conversion factor 1cal = 4.1868
Joule. Then the heating values in GJ are divided by Fuel Consumption (FC ) to get the Net Calorific i,y
Values of the fuels consumed in TJ/kt as follows:

The emission factors of fuels required are taken from IPCC 2006 guidelines for GHG inventories33. All
data used for the calculations can be found in Annex-2 (See Table 1 and Table 2 to in Annex -2).
Table 11 shows total CO emission by fuel types calculated using lower IPCC emission factors and 2
available data from the TEİAŞ website.
Table 11: Calculation of emission by electricity generation (2008-2010)
Net electricity generated and supplied to the grid by thermal power plants has been calculated using
data obtained from TEİAŞ web page. The ratio between total gross and total net generation (including
low-cost/must run plants) has been calculated for each year. The same ratio is assumed to be valid
for all thermal plants and total net generation by the plants has been calculated accordingly. Summing
up total net generation with the imported electricity, total supply excluding low cost / must run sources
for each year is determined and given in Table 12.
Table 12: Net Electricity Generation from thermal power plants (units in GWh)
32 It is shown as zero as in year 2008 and 2010 there was no LPG consumption in the grid.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
The OM Emission Factor for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 are calculated by dividing the total CO 2
emissions for those years (Table10) to the Net Electricity Generation (Table 12) for the subject year.
The annual OM emission factors are calculated as follows (Table 13):
Table 13: Annual OM Emission Factors
2008 0.65959
2009 0.65195
2010 0.65670
Finally, OM emission factor is calculated as a generation weighted average for the three most recent
years. The resulting OM Emission Factor is;
EF = 0.65613 grid,OMsimple
Build margin (BM)
As mentioned above we have preferred the Option 1, calculating the Build Margin Emission factor, “ex
ante”, for the first crediting period.
Between the SET and SET , the sample group that comprises the larger annual generation is 5-units ≥20%
SET , hence the set of capacity additions in the electricity system that comprise 20% of the system ≥20%
generation is used.
The amount of electricity produced by the SET is calculated to be 4,288.65 GWh. (= AEG 5-units SET-5-
). units
The gross electricity generation in year 2010 is taken as reference for determination of plants that
comprise 20% of the system generation. The gross generation in year 2010 was 211,207.70 GWh
(Table 11) in 2010 out of this amount 7,053.40 GWh was identified34 to be produced by projects that
claimed VERs, excluding this number from the gross generation we end up with 195,992.70 GWh of
electricity which is our AEG and 20% of that amount is calculated as 39,198.54 GWh. TOTAL
Comparing the AEG and 20% of AEG , it is seen that 20% of AEG , is higher than SET-5-units TOTAL TOTAL
AEG SET-5-units.
Thereforethe 20% of AEG with a value of 39,198.54 GWh is to be compared to the capacity TOTAL
additions in the recent years.
Summing up electricity the generations of all the plants added to the Turkish National Grid in 2010
and 2009, but excluding the projects that claimed VERs, their total generation is 47,745.76 GWh.
The total generation by the power plants added in year 2010 is 26,256.04 GWh which is still less than
the 20% of AEG value of 39,198.54 GWh, however we are unable to identify the date of addition TOTAL

Capacity Projection report published by TEIAS (http://212.175.131.171/projeksiyon/KAPASITEPROJEKSIYONU2011.pdf). We

1.7 Project Scale and Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals
The estimates of emission reduction are provided to facilitate evaluation of emission reduction from the
Project. The total estimated emission reduction to be achieved by the project is about 82,553 tons of
CO2e over the crediting period.
With an average annual generation of approximately 92.101 GWh, the Project will reduce emissions by
56,427 tons of CO2e per year and hence the project activity is categorized as “Projects”.

The closed chamber measurement requires the involvement of technicians trained by expert
from Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences under the jurisdiction of the Anhui Agricultural
Bureau. Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences is a comprehensive agricultural research
institution directly under the provincial government. The expert who is the leader of the
experiment has a doctoral degree and her field of study is rice cultivation and GHG
monitoring33 . The chamber measurements were conducted by technicians trained by the
expert on 07 March 2017 for the early season and 10 July 2017 for the second season,
respectively34. The base is embedded just before transplanting, and the first gas sampling
began on the second day after transplanting, followed by sampling every 7 days. After
sampling, the gas is stored in the evacuated vial, and the samples collected after three times
should be taken together for laboratory analysis.
2. Project proponents shall prepare a detailed plan for the seasonal methane
measurements before the start of the season. The plan shall include the schedule for the
field and laboratory measurements, the logistics that are necessary to get the gas
samples to the laboratory and a cropping calendar. The plan shall also include all
reference field specific information regarding location and climate, soil, water
management, plant characteristics, fertilizer treatment and organic amendments.

3.3 Leakage
In accordance with the applicability conditions of the required tool: “Estimation of the increase in
GHG emissions attributable to displacement of pre-project agricultural activities in A/R CDM
project activity”, SNP Patagonia Sur utilized the “Guidelines on conditions under which increase
in GHG emissions related to displacement of pre-project grazing activities in A/R CDM project
activity is insignificant” to demonstrate that leakage in the initial project activity instance is
insignificant. For evidence of the use of this tool and its guidance, please see supporting
document titled “Sec 1.13 Leakage Statement”.
Due to this assessment of insignificance, Equation (7) of the Baseline Methodology Procedure
was not used to calculate leakage (See supporting document titled “Sec 3 Baseline Procedure
Document”).
3.4 Summary of GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals have been estimated in accordance with the AR-
ACM0001 Baseline Methodology Procedure, Sections II-7 and II-7.1. (In addition to this section of
the Project Description, refer to supporting document, “Sec 3 Baseline Procedure Document”).
7. Net Anthropogenic GHG Removals by Sinks
The net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks is the actual net GHG removals by sinks minus
the baseline net GHG removals by sinks minus leakage, therefore, the following general formula
can be used to calculate the net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks of an A/R CDM project

Step 9.0. Ex ante total net anthropogenic GHG emission reductions
Step 9.1. Significance assessment
Only the carbon stored in the above and below ground biomass pools were considered by the project.
While the above-ground pool is mandatory, the below-ground pool is optional but recommended by
the methodology, since it represents between 25% of the carbon stored in above-ground biomass and
is therefore a significant pool. Root-to-shoot ratios and data to estimate the carbon stocks in the
below-ground biomass pool were taken from IPCC GPG (2003).

Step 9.2. Calculation of ex-ante estimation of total net GHG emissions reductions
The ex-ante estimation of total net GHG emission reductions to be generated through the project
activity is calculated as follows:
∆REDDt = (∆CBSLPAt + EBBBSLPAt) – (∆CPSPAt + EBBPSPAt) – (∆CLKt + ELKt) .....equation 8
Where:
 ∆REDDt Ex ante estimated net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission reduction
attributable to the AUD project activity at year t; tCO -e ha-1 2
 ∆CBSLPAt Dum of baseline carbon stock changes in the project area at time t; tCO2-e
 EBBBSLPAt Sum of baseline emissions from biomass burning in the project area at time t;
tCO2-e;
 ∆CPSPAt Sum of ex ante estimated actual carbon stock changes in the project area at
time t; tCO2-e
 EBBPSPAt Sum of (ex ante estimated) actual emissions from biomass burning in the
project area at year t; tCO2-e
 ∆CLKt `Sum of ex ante estimated leakage net carbon changes at year t; tCO2-e
 ELKt Sum of ex ante estimated leakage emissions at year t; tCO2-e
Calculation of ex-ante Verified Carbon Units (Step 9.3 VM0015 v1.1)
The verified Carbon Units (VCTs) are calculated by subtracting the number of Buffer Credits (BCt)
deposited in the VCS Buffer at time t; t CO2-e from Ex ante estimated net anthropogenic greenhouse
gas emission reduction (∆REDDt ) attributable to the AUD project activity at year t; tCO2-e ha-1
(equation 9)
VCUt = ∆REDDt – VBCt ……….equation 9
Where:
VCUt Number of Verified Carbon Units that can be traded at time t; t CO2-e
∆REDDt Defined above
The Buffer for risk carbon unit are calculated by subtracting the total ex ante estimated actual
carbon stock changes in the project area at year t; tCO2-e ha-1 from the gross baseline carbon stock
changes in the project area at year t; tCO2e and multiplied by Risk factor (equation 10). Ex-ante
buffer credits are calculated based on a 15% risk factor estimated through the VCS non-permanence
risk tool.

are calculated as follows:
ERy = BEy – PEy - LE y
ERy = Emission reductions in year y (tCO2e/yr)
BEy = Baseline emissions in year y (tCO2e/yr)
PEy = Project emissions in year y (tCO2e/yr).

Estimating carbon stock in trees at a point in time:
To estimate the carbon stock in tree biomass at a point in time. the following tool was used: “Estimation of
carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in A/R CDM project activities AR-TOOL14
Version 04.1”. According to section 8.2 of this tool. this method is used for ex-ante estimation (projection)
of carbon stock in tree biomass. Under this method. existing data are used in combination with tree
growth models to predict the growth of trees and the development of the tree stand over time.
- Step 1: Tree carbon estimation
According to point 6 of Annex 1 of the AR-TOOL 14, for ex-ante estimation the allometric equation
applied to a tree species shall be selected from the following sources:
a) Existing data applicable to local situation (e.g. represented by similar ecological conditions).
b) National data (e.g. from national forest inventory or national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory).
c) Data from neighbouring countries with similar conditions.
d) Globally applicable data.
An equation for H. Brasilensis derived from national inventories has not been developed for Colombia.
The equation available for this specie in the country depends on allometric parameters and there is not an

available database with allometric parameters that allow us to adjust a time equation to estimate the ex-
ante carbon stocks. Considering this, a time-equation based on data from a neighbour country with
similar conditions was used96.
Table 14 shows the carbon accumulation model (Car) for Hevea brasiliensis and its respective
parameters. Parameters were estimated calculated by Wauters et al. (2008)97through the adjustment of a
Gompertz model, which matched the evolution of carbon stocks in total tree as a function of stand age.
The Gompertz equation was fitted with 80 data from Mato Grosso, Brazil. This site has not the same, but
similar environmental conditions to the project area: annual rainfall ranges from 1,500 to 2,000 mm and
annual temperature between 20 and 25 °C.

*Where: Y= above+below ground tree carbon (tCha-1); A= age (year); α. β and k are parameters estimated by
Wauters et al. (2008).
The allometric equation described in Table 14 has a R2 greater than 0.85 and a size sample greater than
30. According to point c of paragraph 6 of the tool “Demonstrating appropriateness of allometric equations
for estimation of aboveground tree biomass in A/R CDM project activities”, the equation developed by
Wauters et al. (2008) meet all the requirements.

- Step 4: soil organic carbon
Estimations of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks were done in accordance to the ―Tool for the estimation
of change in soil organic carbon stocks due to the implementation of A/R CDM project activity version
1.1.0‖ (Annex 12). As suggested by the tool. it is assumed that the implementation of the project activity
increases the SOC content of the lands from the pre-project level to the level that is equal to the steady-
state SOC content under native vegetation. The increase in SOC content in the project scenario takes
place at a constant rate over a period of 20 years from the year of planting. The project meets the
applicability conditions of this tool in the area managed with rubber plantations:
The areas of land to which the tool is applied do not fall into wetland category, do not contain organic
soils and are not subject to any of the land management practices and application of inputs listed in
Tables 1 and 2 of the tool.
Since the land use prior to project start was grassland, only Table 2 applies. For the Tropical, moist
climate region corresponding to the project activity, none of the three combinations included in Table 15
are applicable; litter remains on site and is not removed and soil disturbance is in accordance with
appropriate conservation practices, limited to site preparation and less than 10%. As the main goal of the
project is not the wood harvesting, but the rubber. Not additional site preparations will be developed at
least for the first 35 years of the rubber productivity cycle (less than 20 years).
The initial SOC stock at the start of the Project is estimated as follows:
(4)
= SOC stock at the beginning of the A/R CDM project activity in stratum
i of the areas of land; t C ha-1
= Reference SOC stock corresponding to the reference condition in
native lands (i.e. non-degraded. unimproved lands under native
vegetation ñ normally forest) by climate region and soil type
applicable to stratum i of the areas of land; t C ha-1
= Relative stock change factor for baseline land-use in stratum i of the
areas of land; dimensionless
= Relative stock change factor for baseline management regime in
stratum i of the areas of land; dimensionless
= Relative stock change factor for baseline input regime (e.g. crop
residue returns. manure) in stratum i of the areas of land;

Determination of EFBL,c
However, the baseline emission factor for continuously flooded fields without organic
amendments ( ) can be determined ex ante prior to the start of the project activity, in this
case, the ex ante value should be used to calculate emission reduction during the crediting 𝐵𝐵𝐸𝐸𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵,𝑐𝑐
period. It should be measured by using closed chamber in three reference fields which are
chosen in the project area.
According to the guidance on methane measurement in the appendix of AMS-III.AU
Methodology, the following requirements should be met.
1. The implementation of methane measurement in rice fields requires the involvement of
experts in this field or at least experienced staff trained by experts (i.e. from research
institutions). These guidelines cannot replace expertise in setting up chamber measurements.
They rather set minimum requirements that serve for standardizing the conditions under
which methane emissions are measured for projects under this methodology.
The closed chamber measurement requires the involvement of technicians trained by experts
from Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences under the jurisdiction of the Anhui Agricultural
Bureau. Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences is a comprehensive agricultural research
28 For all scaling factor used in this methodology, the average values in 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories are chosen.

experiment has a doctoral degree and her field of study is rice cultivation and GHG
monitoring29. The expert set up the chamber measurements on 22 March 2017 for the early
season and 29 July 2017 for the second season, respectively. The base is embedded just
before transplanting, and the first gas sampling began on the second day after transplanting,
followed by sampling every 7days. After sampling, the gas is stored in the evacuated vial,
and the samples collected after three times should be taken together for laboratory analysis.
Project proponents shall prepare a detailed plan for the seasonal methane measurements
before the start of the season. The plan shall include the schedule for the field and laboratory
measurements, the logistics that are necessary to get the gas samples to the laboratory and
a cropping calendar. The plan shall also include all reference field specific information
regarding location and climate, soil, water management, plant characteristics, fertilizer
treatment and organic amendments.
The details of the reference fields for measuring EFBL,c and the plan for the seasonal
methane measurements before the start of the season is shown as following:

1.10 Project Scale and Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals
REFORESTADORA CUMARE SAS afforestation of lands except wetlands is classified as a “project”,
according to its scale. It will remove a total amount of 2,918,000 tCO e during a period of 100 years (ex 2
ante LTA estimation). This means an average of 29,180 tCO e per year. 2
5 First plantations started in 2013, but these are not part of the project activity given the retroactive period allowed by
VCS.

Ex-ante total net reduction of GHG anthropogenic Emissions
Significance Assessment
Based on the document ""EB-CDM approved"" “Tool for testing significance of GHG emissions in
A/R CDM Project activities”, we could verify that the above-ground biomass will contribute with 85% of the
expected emissions in the baseline scenario. On the other side, below-ground biomass will contribute
with 15%.
Ex-ante estimate calculation of GHG emissions total net reduction
VM0015 Equation 19 has been used to calculate the ex-ante estimate of the project emission
reduction.
Ex-ante calculation of Verified Carbon Units (VCUs)
VM0015 Equation 20 was applied to estimate the number of VCUs. The project Risk Factor
parameter was estimated using the VCS AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool, resulting in 10%.

The number of credits to be held in the permanence risk buffer (as per the VCS) is determined as a
percentage of the total carbon stock benefits. This is equal to the net emissions in the baseline minus
emissions from fossil fuel use and fertilizer use minus the net emissions in the project case minus
emissions from fossil fuels and fertilizer use. Leakage emissions do not factor into the buffer calculations.

4.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
According to ACM0002 “Consolidated baseline methodology for grid-connected
electricity generation from renewable sources”(Version 20.0), the net GHG emission
reductions are calculated as follows:
Emission Reductions (ER ) =BE -PE -LE y y y y
Baseline emissions:
BE = EG * EF y facility,y grid,CM , y
According to the feasibility study of the proposed project, the net electricity generated
is approximately 101,689MWh i.e. EG =101,689MWh; facility,y
Based on section B.6.1, the baseline emissions factor (EF ) of ECPG is grid,CM,y
calculated as 0.8269 tCO e/MWh. 2
BE = EG * EF =101,689 (MWh)×0.8269(tCO e/MWh)= 84,086 tCO e y facility,y grid,CM , y 2 2
