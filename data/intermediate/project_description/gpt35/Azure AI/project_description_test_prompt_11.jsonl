These shares can be agro-forestry and pasture\nsystems, which provide food (plant and animal) and wood products from plantations with native\nspecies in combination with agricultural crops or livestock systems. These systems can be a source of\nsmall timber for building houses, fences, barns and other facilities that are required by the RIU-SM, so\nthat they can replace those from secondary forests and ensure that these forests can be transformed\nto primary forests.\u201d\nActivity A2.2: To design and to develop a training and education program plan for the administration\nand management of natural resources RIU-SM.\nActivity A2.3: To manage resources for project design and establishment of production chains.\n\uf0b7 Product 3: A mechanism for valuation and compensation for environmental services generated in the\nRIU-SM, validated and verified.\nActivity A3.1: To validate a REDD+ Project with international standards.\nActivity A3.2: To verify the project and to record the units of forest compensation for avoided\ndeforestation.\nProject Size\nThe following considerations are taking account:\n- Resguardo Ind\u00edgena Unifcado \u2013 Selva de Matav\u00e9n (RIU-SM) has an area of 1,856,836 hectares.\n- Resguardo Ind\u00edgena Unifcado \u2013 Selva de Matav\u00e9n (RIU-SM) has a forest area of 1,477,115 hectares\n(79.6% of RIU-SM is forest). 1,233,250 hectares are primary forests, 232,536 hectares are flooded\nprimary forests and 11,329 hectares are secondary forests.\n- The Region Reference to project deforestation rate (RRD) has an area of 1,444,805 hectares.\n- The Project Area (PA) has an area of 1,150,212 hectares.\n- The Leakage Belt (LB) has an area of 486,211 hectares.\n- The Region Reference to project the location of deforestation (RRL) has an area of 2,028,439\nhectares, of which 1,636,423 hectares are forests and 392,016 hectares are not forests.\nv3.0 19\n\nJOINT PROJECT DESCRIPTION & MONITORING REPORT: VCS Version 3\nIt is expected to avoid the emission of 140,487,762 tons of CO2 equivalent (t CO e) in the baseline 2\nscenario during the lifetime of the project (30 years) (average annual emission of 4,682,925 tons of CO ). 2\nProject emissions are 21,876,151 tons of equivalent CO (t CO e) (with an annual average of 729,205 2 2\ntons of CO ); shifting leakage emissions due to the project activities are 9,941,049 tons of equivalent CO 2 2\n(t CO e) (with an annual average of 331,368 tons of CO ), involving the addition of emissions within the 2 2\nleakage belt in the baseline scenario (9,054,489 tCO e) and emissions outside the leakage belt in the 2\nbaseline scenario (886,560 tCO e). 2\nThe net total emission reduction discounting Project emissions and leakage is 108,670,562 tons of\nequivalent CO (t CO e) (with an average of 3,622,352 tons of CO ). 2 2 2\nThe net total of GHG reductions for project activities adjusted for uncertainty in the baseline scenario is\nequal to the net total of emission reduction of the Project, which is deducted to obtain a cumulative\nuncertainty of 8.4%, with a probability of 95%, which is 15% below of defined by the standard.\nThe value of discount credits to be deposited into the buffer is 20,163,974 tons of equivalent CO , with an 2\nannual average of 672,132 tons of CO . 2\nThe estimated total number of VCUs in the lifetime of the project is 83,578,228, with an annual average of\n2,785,941 and for the first crediting period of Baseline (during its first 10 years) have 3 million net \/ year\nVCUs.2\n1.1.2 Implementation Status of the Project\nProduct 1:\n\uf0b7 Activity A1.1: Captains, zone coordinators and members were trained and they apply environmental\nknowledge (Annex 1).

Hiring advertisements include an explicit statement regarding discrimination to let potential\napplicants know that they are welcome to apply regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity.\n2. Managers are instructed in the importance of avoiding the act or the appearance of\nfavouritism based on gender, race, or ethnicity.\n3. Hiring and promotions are reviewed for potential discrimination by human resources\nspecialists and upper management in the US to confirm fair treatment of potential hires and\nstaff eligible for promotion.\n3.2 Evidence of Right of Use (G5)\nThe property is owned in fee simple ownership under the laws of Belize. Titles have been\nproduced and reviewed by the auditors. The project is authorized by virtue of approval for\nselective harvesting as indicated by a forest license and an approved sustainable harvest\nmanagement plan.\n3.3 Emissions Trading Programs and Other Binding Limits (CL1)\nCredit sales will be tracked using the APX13 registry. Emissions reductions or removals\ngenerated by the project will not be used for compliance with an emissions trading program or to\nmeet binding limits on GHG emissions. Belize currently does not have a national, legally binding\nlimit on greenhouse gas emissions, and there currently is no compliance emissions trading\nprogram which accepts REDD credits in Belize.\n3.4 Participation under Other GHG Programs (CL1)\nThis is the first and only application for this project to a GHG program.\n3.5 Other Forms of Environmental Credit (CL1)\nNo other environmental credit has been created by this project. The co-benefits of the project\nhave been proposed for validation to the Climate, Community, and Biodiversity Alliance using the\nClimate, Community and Biodiversity Standard 3rd Edition. Gold level validation is proposed\nbased on exceptional biodiversity benefits.\n3.6 Projects Rejected by Other GHG Programs (CL1)\nThis is the first and only application for this project to a GHG program.\n3.7 Respect for Rights and No Involuntary Relocation (G5)\nFree, Prior, and Informed Consent\nTFG owns the property fee simple.
