Wetlands,\ndegraded forests and other sites are protected as part of the FSC certification scheme.\nAccording to the soil classification of the IPCC, all gleysols are considered wetland soils and\ntherefore the respective areas are treated commonly as wetlands.\nAccording to internal SOP\u2019s, plantations are not established on wetlands. Soil analysis of the\nplantations, which were conducted by independent consultants confirm this procedure. The most\nrepresented soil types on the FMU 9 are Rhodic Ferralsol and Rhodic Acrisols. The data of a\nRhodic Ferralsol, which occurs on 1,100 ha of the FMU 9 is shown in Table 11. Very common are\nalso Rhodic Acrisols in FMU 9 (700 ha). These soil types belong to the IPCC class of \u201cLow activity\nclay soils\u201d. However, some FMUs, incorporate gleysols typical for wetlands. Whenever this is the\ncase, these areas are protected and not used for afforestation or any other purposes. This is\nsupported by baseline and project land use plans. The plantations are established only on former\nagriculture or pasture land. Further, soil analysis results are available upon request.\n\nTable 11.

The maximum density of plantations uses a spacing of 5 x 2 m, with a\nseparation of 5 meters between lines and 2 m between trees for pure plantations. In the case of\nsilvopastoral systems, trees are established in double rows of 5 x 2 m like pure plantations, and\nthen separated by a wider alleyway in between of 9 m.

{"input":"Question: What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?\n\nContext: \n\n1 PROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nThe project changing from continuously flooded to intermittently flooded conditions during rice\ncultivation is conducted in the west of Tongren City, Guizhou Province, China, with a total acreage\nof 18,892 ha for single-cropping rice. Without the project, which provides ditches to conduct\nintermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously flooded method would be continued,\nso the scenario that rice was cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline\nscenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded conditions can emit a large amount\nof methane because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittently flooded method is more\nbeneficial to water conservation, production increase, and less methane emission reduction than\nthe continuously flooded.\nThe implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir\nconstruction, pumps and valves installation, training, etc. According to the needs of rice growth,\nfarmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water\nresources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic\nconditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice\npaddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in\nthe rainy season. In this case, the methane emission can be declined by an average of 48%.\nHence, with the proposed project activity, the estimated GHG reduction from rice is 3.13\ntCO e\/ha. 2\nThe implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to\n413,980 tCO e in the first seven-year period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 2\n59,140 tCO e.

This reduces the country\u2019s \nreliance on fossil fuels, majority of which is imported and provides economic \nvalue to crop residues, which previously had no commercial value.  \n  \nEnvironmental well being  \n \nThe project activity will result in GHG emission reduction by utilising biomass \nresidues as fuel and avoiding use of displacing fossil fuel. In addition to the reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions the project implementation will \navoid the emission of other harmful gases (NOx and SOx) that arise from the \ncombustion of coal used in heat generation.

The Project Area has ecological, scientific,\neducational and aesthetic value in its present state as a natural area that has not been subject to\ndevelopment or severe resource exploitation.\nThe Project Area is comprised of primarily native forest types characteristic of the region. The forest\nprotects the West Kammerdiner Run and McElhattan Run, headwaters of the Susquehanna River and the\nChesapeake Bay. The Project Area contains significant stands of diverse mixed hardwoods as well as\noak hickory forest types and wetlands that provide habitat for a multitude of species and natural\ncommunities.\nIn the 20 years preceding the project\u2019s inception, the forest across the property have been largely\nunmanaged. The tracts have been heavily influenced by fire, deer browse pressure, ice damage and\nforest pests but these factors have led to different trajectories of forest development based on soils,\naspect and other ecological and management factors. Major portions of Lock Haven City Authority\n(LHCA) properties have been high-graded. Overall, LHCA tracts can be characterized as fully stocked,\nmid-successional dominated, dry hemlock\/white pine and mixed oak stands that have degraded\nunderstory conditions with moderate encroachment of undesirable competing plants that are negatively\nimpacting stand dynamics surrounding composition, structure, and regeneration.\nThe project will extend the rotation age of the timber resource on the property by approximately 45 years\ncompared to Common Practice, thereby reducing carbon emissions and increasing carbon sequestration.\nThe project activity will employ a sustainable level of harvesting, as specified in the FSC compliant\nmanagement plan required by the conservation easement, and will facilitate improvements in the overall\nhealth of the forest. The project on average will generate 6,383 mtCO2e annually and 370,187 mtCO2e\ntotal GHG emission reductions and removals.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThe Project is within sectoral scope 14; Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU).

The system\nconsists of four sets of WHR preheater boilers equipped with evaporator and super-heater,\n8\n\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\nThis project activity intends to eliminate the need for importing 13.25 MW from AVVNL and\ngenerate it in-house by installation of the Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) Captive Power Plant,\nutilizing the exit gases from preheater, AQC and also DG. In the absence of the project\nactivity, the power demand would have been met by grid which is predominantly based on\nfossil-fuel fired generation plants. The project activity itself, would not contribute to any\nadditional GHG emissions since the chemical composition of the waste gas at the inlet and\noutlet of the WHR boilers remains same and no other secondary fuel is fed in the boiler.\nThereby the project activity reduces the dependence on fossil fuel based generation units\nand as there are no associated emissions with this project it contributes to the reduction of\ngreenhouse gases (GHG) emissions.\n1.14 Compliance with Laws, Statutes and Other Regulatory Frameworks\nThere is no a legal requirement for cement industries in India to utilize the heat content of\nwaste gases from the manufacturing process to generate electricity. The project proponent\nwould implement the project activity over and above the national or sectoral requirements\nwith an objective to utilize waste resources available from manufacturing process and use it\nto generate electricity for its own utilization. The project proponent received the Consent to\nOperate from local Pollution Control Board. It also received Host Country Approval (HCA)\nfrom India\u2019s CDM DNA \u2013 Ministry of Environment and Forest for registration in UNFCCC\nCDM. In the absence of the project activity the equivalent electricity requirement of the\nfacility would be met by AVVNL grid supply resulting in CO emissions from the thermal 2\npower stations (supplying electricity to grid). However, due to project activity, project\nproponent would be able to replace equivalent amount of generation mix, resulting in\nreduction of corresponding CO emissions at the thermal power plants. 2\n1.15 Participation under Other GHG Programs\nProjects Registered (or seeking registration) under Other GHG Program(s)\nProject has been registration with UNFCCC under Clean Development Mechanism program,\nRegistration reference number is 02842.\nProjects Rejected by Other GHG Programs\nThe Project is not rejected by any other GHG programs.\n1.16 Other Forms of Credit\nEmissions Trading Programs and Other Binding Limits\n2 https:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/Projects\/DB\/TUEV-SUED1140718710.42\/view\n12\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\nIndia is Non-annex1 country and there is no compliance with an emission trading program\nor to meet binding limits on GHG emissions for this project activity.

Various benefits associated\nare as follows:\nSocial Well-being - Project activity would increase small fraction of employment for semi-\nskilled and skilled labour and professionals in the region by providing direct and indirect\nemployment.\nEconomic Well-being - The project activity brings in related economic benefits for the local\ncommunity and would lead to sustainable economic and industrial growth in the region. The\nproject activity shows less dependence of project proponent on grid-supplied electricity.\nEnvironmental Well-being- A major share of the region\u2019s electricity is generated from fossil\nfuel sources, mostly from coal based thermal power plants. The project activity would be\nable to displace\/ replace electricity generated by grid-connected power plant thus saving\nfurther exploitation and depletion of natural resources \u2013 coal, or else increasing its\navailability to other important processes.\n13","output":"{'crediting_period_start': '2008-04-01', 'crediting_period_end': '2018-03-31'}"}

{"input":"Question: What is the methodology of this project?\n\nContext: \n\nVCS Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report Template, v4.3\nSince parameters \u0394SI and \u0394SI were deemed significantly different (via Z test control,t=4 wp,t=4\napplied as shown in equation (A5) of VCS VM0047), the project demonstrates additionality for\nthe performance benchmark in the first verification at time t=4. The result of the Z test\nperformed is 2.071, and the full process followed to obtain it is outlined in section 7.2. Baseline\nemissions.\nInvestment barrier\nAs per the Tool 1 Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality - Version 07.0.0\nthe aim of the present step is to determine whether the proposed project activity is not\neconomically or financially feasible, without the revenue from the sale of certified emission\nreductions (CERs). As the project consists in providing freely to the communities and farmers\nfruit trees in order for them to introduce agroforestry, raising their own revenues, there is no\nrevenue for the project activity, thus the investment analysis is non applicable.\n3.6 Methodology Deviations\nThe project uses an area-based approach to all its territories with a deviation that set\nleakage is set 0 as the project matches almost totally with the VCS - VM0047 requirement for\ncensus-based approach of \u201cnot produce continuous vegetative cover (associated with the\nplanting units) on any contiguous area exceeding one hectare\u201d. This requirement justifies that\nin this type of project leakage is set to 0, and there are no pre-existing activities that could\ninadvertently transfer emissions (leakages).\nThe objective of the project was to plant millions of trees in an immense territory on the lands\nof thousands of small subsistence farmers, to benefit local communities, and due to the\ncharacteristics of land ownership in Zambia, this means that some plots have an area less\nthan 1ha, although the average of the 1,715 plots finally included in the project is 1.22 ha.\nA few plantation plots (only 7, less than 0.3%), are smaller than 0.09 ha or narrower than 30\nmeters, equivalent to just one Landsat pixel (30x30 meters, or 0.09 ha) so for the generation\nof the performance benchmark project plots must be eliminated from the selection to ensure\nhaving good quality stocking indexes calculations.\nSatellite images have been chosen to have each year a complete coverage for the dry season,\nto minimize the effect of grass vegetation, when available. However, for year 2010 (t-10) there\nare not enough images to have a complete coverage of the area and some of the images have\nclouds that affect the project plots, so a coverage for year 2009 (complete and cloud free\nwithing the working area) will be used as initial reference.\n77\n\nFig 14. Landsat 5 coverage for year 2010 and project plots within Western Zambia.\nFig 15.

The project activities building on to its establishment and consequent\nimplementation have all been in compliance with the approved methodologies (including the\nVERRA standard) being applied and the safeguards. The Project has followed all the\nrecommendations in the Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA for the CIDP)\nas summarized in the Environmental Social Management Plan. A monitoring plan is in place\nand will be adhered to throughout the project monitoring period covering mainly the following\nkey steps;\n1. Geo Mapping of the Cashew fields using a designed project specific app\n2. Random sampling (using R Program) of the plots in the cashew field growing areas\nacross the Project Landscape for carbon estimation. With the selection of the plots,\nthe carbon in each of the plots is quantified through the field measurements and remote\nsensing determining emissions reductions (or removals) and providing the basis for\nascertaining project performance.\n3. Additionality and the baseline of the project are determined with the performance\nbenchmark, comparing the project plots with the control plots.\nCurrently, data and documentation for the verification process are being collected\nsystematically and prepared along with the project implementation activities.\nA thorough stakeholder mapping has been conducted and the engagement plan in place to\nprovide the basis for integrating concerns in the design and implementation strategy. The Local\nStakeholder Consultations (LSC) has created awareness and built confidence in the project\nthereby enhancing transparency and addressing core issues that if not observed would\nadversely affect the project.

{"input":"Question: What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?\n\nContext: \n\nJoint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.0\n1 PROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nThe proposed VCS grouped project \u201cAfforestation in Eucalyptus and Acacia plantations for\nBurapha Agroforestry Co., Ltd.\u201d (hereafter \u2018Burapha\u2019), represents one of the first major\nafforestation projects of the private sector in Lao PDR. It promotes and implements\nafforestation of Eucalyptus and Acacia agroforestry plantations on degraded areas. These\nareas are either village owned or part of governmental \u201cForest Protection Areas\u201d, which entirely\nare degraded by swidden agriculture for rice cropping by local communities.\nThe plantations are established in the Prefecture of Vientiane and the Provinces of Vientiane,\nXayabouly, and Saysomboun in Lao PDR. Local villagers are allowed to use the plantations for\nintercropping or grazing, which is part of the Agroforestry approach of the project. Burapha is a\nLao-Swedish company that aims to produce high quality timber for the veneer, plywood and\nsawmill industry. The project generates GHG removals through tree and soil carbon\nsequestration. These credits are generated using the CDM methodology AR-ACM0003:\n\u201cAfforestation and reforestation of lands except wetlands\u201d (version 2).\nBurapha is also FSC certified and managed to plant successfully about 3,475 ha by 2020,\ncontracted from 23 villages and plans to scale up its plantations to 15,000 ha by 2021. The\nfuture goal is to manage 68,750 ha of forests in total, consisting of approximately 55,000 ha of\nplantations and 13,750 ha of protected areas. These protected areas correspond to 20% of the\ntotal area, which are set aside for conservation management.\nThe main tree species of the project are the exotic species of Eucalyptus cumadulensis or cross\nwith E. urophylla, E. pellits, or E. grandis) which is planted on 66% of the area and Acacia\nauriculiformis with subsequent 33% of the planting area. The rotation period is 7 years and\nduring the first years the local farmers can do intercropping. Between years 3 to 7 cattle\ngrazing is allowed on the plantation areas and in the years 3 and 4 the plantations get thinned\nout. After the first rotation the Eucalypts get coppiced and replanted after each second rotation.\nThe project will generate average removals of 130.2 t CO2\/ha. Over a crediting period of 20\nyears the project will generate 408,682 tCO e and 20,434 tCO \/yr. 2 2\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\n5\n\nJoint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.0\nAccording to VCS Standard document version 4, the project activities fall under the eligible\nAFOLU project category of \u201cAfforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR).\nThe proposed project is designed as a VCS grouped project.\n1.3 Project Eligibility\nThe project supports the scope of the VCS program by initiating project activities that sequester\ncarbon through afforestation of degraded lands.\nA) 10 years no clearance of native ecosystems\nAccording to the VCS Standard (V4), eligible ARR areas must be areas that have been cleared of\nnative ecosystems at least 10 years prior project establishment (Appendix 1.1). Furthermore,\nthe VCS Program (V4, AFOLU requirements) states: \u201cActivities that convert native ecosystems to\ngenerate GHG credits are not eligible under the VCS Program.\u201d1\nBurapha establishes its plantations on degraded areas, formerly used by swidden agriculture.\nThe occurring fallow forest is not deemed a native ecosystem. If clearing occurred 10 years\nprior the plantation establishment the plantations are eligible under the VCS.\nIn terms of the land acquisition process, Burapha follows a participatory approach to identify\nsuitable areas for its afforestation plantations, which is described in the SOP \u201cLand Acquisition\nOperations Manual\u201d (provided as supporting documentation, see page 13):\n\u201cLand seemingly without conflicting land use risks, in particular not with permanent agriculture.\nLand shall meet the government\u2019s definition for \u201cdegraded land2\u201d and land allowed for forest\nproduction (not flat land suitable for agriculture\/paddy rice production).\u201d\nBurapha defined a number of guiding principles of this process, the \u201cLand Selection Criteria\u201d\n(SOP Land Acquisition Operations Manual, Appendix 1). Amongst others, the socio-economic\ncriteria mention suitable land for Burapha plantations shall be \u201cland currently without any\npermanent agriculture production, primarily abandoned shifting cultivation land and where\nthere is minimal risk of land use conflicts.\u201d\nAnd furthermore:\n\u201cThe previous land use shall be recorded, divided on a number of given land uses and the year\nof last use of the land for economic production shall be recorded.

(hereafter Arbec) operates a sawmill facility located on the banks of the\nP\u00e9ribonka river, at the outskirts of the village of L'Ascension-de-Notre-Seigneur, in the Lac Saint-Jean\nregion, Province of Quebec. The company sells both green and dried wood, the latter being the\npreferred product, especially in the United States.\nIn July 2008, Arbec bought a nearby sawmill, which had its own logging rights. Arbec chose to close\ndown the newly acquired sawmill and transfer the logging rights to its P\u00e9ribonka sawmill, which had\nadditional sawing capacity. With this recent acquisition of logging rights and the addition of new\nproduction equipment, the production capacity of the Peribonka sawmill increased significantly to\napproximately 227 MBF1 on an annual basis. However, Arbec\u2019s drying capacity could not match this\nsubstantial increase in sawing capacity. Before the expansion of the sawmill production capacity, Arbec\noperated three (3) wood dryers, with a total drying capacity of 134 MBF per year. Hence, Arbec was\nfaced with an estimated drying deficit of 93 MBF per year.\nIn 2008 and 2009, Arbec\u2019s drying capacity deficit did not yield significant impacts on Arbec\u2019s business\nbecause of the overall lower demand for lumber products due to the economic recession. However, with\nthe recovery of lumber markets, demand for Arbec\u2019s products is increasing and Arbec is beginning to\noperate at full capacity once again. Hence Arbec\u2019s limited drying capacities cannot meet the increasing\ndemand for its products. This led Arbec\u2019s management to consider the installation of a new wood dryer\nat its Peribonka facility.\nPrior to the Project, energy needs at Arbec\u2019s L\u2019Ascension operation were supplied as follows:\n\u2022 Three dryers equipped with burners that directly fire butane to produce heat for wood drying;\n\u2022 A fuel oil-fired boiler producing hot water for space heating of the sawmill building.\nAs summarized in Table 2 and in Table 3, to satisfy the increasing demand for wood drying, Arbec\n1 MBF: Millions of \u201cBoard Feet\u201d which is the equivalent of 1 inch X 1 foot X 1 foot.\n1 MBF: Millions of \u201cBoard Feet\u201d which is the equivalent of 1 inch X 1 foot X 1 foot.\n3\n2\u00c9 Icto cRoeuslds ohuarvcee sb eCeanr bdoenseig, nfoerd A torb reucn on butane too.\n3 For example renewable energy certificates\n4 Available at: http:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/methodologies\/SSCmethodologies\/approved","output":"{'crediting_period_start': '2012-01-01', 'crediting_period_end': '2021-12-31'}"}

Description of the project activity:\n>>\nThe proposed Heilongjiang Muling Daimagou Wind Farm Project (phase 1) (hereinafter referred to as the\nProject) is to generate renewable electricity using wind power resources and to sell the generated output\nto the Northeast Power Grid (NEPG) on the basis of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The proposed\nproject activity will generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions by avoiding CO emissions from 2\nelectricity generation of fossil fuel fired power that is supplied to the NEPG.\nThe Heilongjiang Muling Daimagou Wind Farm Project (phase 1) is located in the Muling City,\nHeilongjiang. A decision has been made to install a total of 35 wind turbines, each of which has the\ncapacity of 850 kW to best suit the local conditions. The total power capacity, therefore, of the proposed\nproject activity is 29.75MW. The expected net supplied power to the grid is 65,695 MWh per year.\nThe project will assist China in stimulating and accelerating the commercialisation of grid-connected\nrenewable energy technologies and markets which is an important objective of the Chinese Government.\nThe project will therefore help reduce GHG emissions versus the high-growth, coal-dominated business-\nas-usual scenario. Furthermore, the project will improve air quality and local livelihoods and promote\nsustainable renewable energy industry development. The specific goals of the project are to:\n\u2022 generate clean electricity\n\u2022 reduce greenhouse gas emissions in China compared to a business-as-usual scenario;\n\u2022 helping to stimulate the growth of the wind power industry in China;\n\u2022 creating local employment opportunity during the assembly and installation of wind turbines, and\nfor operation of the wind farm;\n\u2022 reducing other pollutants resulting from the fossil fuel fired power plants compared with a\nbusiness-as-usual scenario.\nA.3.

Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the backward continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario.
