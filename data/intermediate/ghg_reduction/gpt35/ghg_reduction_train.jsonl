Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences is a comprehensive agricultural research\ninstitution directly under the provincial government. The expert who is the leader of the\nexperiment has a doctoral degree and her field of study is rice cultivation and GHG\nmonitoring34.

The steps to be followed in the quantification of\nemissions according to the methodology are:\nStep 1: Estimate the amount of biomass removed. Said estimate is made in systems with existing non-woody\nor shrub-like vegetation and for the pasture lands the maximum stock present is considered, in order to be\nconservative. For coffee plantations it is carried out by counting the coffee trees eliminated per tree unit of\nthe tree stand model incorporated. The number of coffee trees removed is variable, given that their planting\ndensity in the region ranges from 6,000 to 10,000 trees\/ha. The biomass estimate per individual unit is carried\nout through equations generated for the region are based on existing equations from the scientific literature\nwith data from the area51.\nStep 2: Estimate the average biomass proportion harvested (with the information and procedures of step 1)\nand apply the respective GHG emission factor.

It should be measured by using closed chamber in three reference fields\nwhich are chosen in the project area.\nAccording to the guidance on methane measurement in the appendix of AMS-III.AU\nMethodology, the following requirements should be met.\n1. The implementation of methane measurement in rice fields requires the\ninvolvement of experts in this field or at least experienced staff trained by experts\n(i.e. from research institutions). These guidelines cannot replace expertise in\nsetting up chamber measurements. They rather set minimum requirements that\nserve for standardizing the conditions under which methane emissions are\nmeasured for projects under this methodology.\nThe closed chamber measurement requires the involvement of technicians trained by\nexperts from Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences under the jurisdiction of the Anhui\nAgricultural Bureau. Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences is a comprehensive\nagricultural research institution directly under the provincial government. The expert who is\nthe leader of the experiment has a doctoral degree and her field of study is agricultural\nenvironmental engineering33. The expert set up the chamber measurements on 7 March\n2017 for the early season and 9 July 2017 for the second season, respectively34. The base\nis embedded just before transplanting, and the first gas sampling began on the second day\nafter transplanting, followed by sampling every 7days. After sampling, the gas is stored in\nthe evacuated vial, and the samples collected after three times should be taken together for\nlaboratory analysis.\n2.

However, in the framework of the VCS, relevant\ngreenhouse gas emissions of the baseline scenario shall be considered (VCS 2007.1, paragraph 6.3.1).\nThe baseline studies made by CIRAD (200040; 200141) first described the activities present in the\nreference scenario and the project scenario (Table 9) within project boundary, and then listed all GHG\nsources related to the activities approached (Table 10).\nTable 9: Activities of reference scenario and project scenario.\nTable 10: Carbon pools and GHG sources of reference scenario and project scenario.\nEmissions from combustion of fossil fuel\nThe combustion of fossil fuels occurs in both reference and project scenario but the related GHG\nemissions are supposed to be higher in the project scenario because of additional activities (reforestation\nactivities). However, they should be very low and negligible in comparison with CO removals from 2\nforest plantations.\nThe GHG emissions were calculated by following IPCC GL 2006 with the date monitored in the fazenda.\nEvery year, 2\u2019000 liters of diesel oil are consumed by project activities. Depending on years, a trade-off\nexists between activities but global consumption remains similar. By applying IPCC method and default\nvalues (EF = 2.707 kgCO .L-1), a total of 54.14 tCO were emitted during the last 10 years, since Diesel oil 2 2\nproject start. If this result is compared to the GHG emissions from fossil fuel combustion of the reference\nscenario, the net GHG emissions can reasonably be neglected.\nEmissions from biomass burning\n40 Locatelli, B., 2000.

Fire is used each year in order to stimulate growth of grasses. In terms\nof greenhouse gas, CO , CH , CO, NO and N O are emitted. While CO emissions are compensated by 2 4 x 2 2\nthe regrowth of grasses, the other GHG emissions remain in the atmosphere, representing a GHG source.\nIn the project scenario such practice is not used as pastures are converted to forest lands. Thus, GHG\nemissions from biomass burning in the reference scenario are net GHG emissions, but if accidental fires\noccur in the project area. Therefore GHG emissions from biomass burning could represent a relevant\nGHG source.\nHowever, such emissions need large amount of biomass burning to be significant. As an example CH is 4\nthe main GHG released during biomass burning with an emission factor of 67 g.(kg d.m)-1, in comparison\nwith other GHG that have emissions factors lower than 4 g.(kg d.m)-1. Considering a hypothetical initial\nbiomass of 30 t d.m.ha-1 in pasture of the project area, which is high, the CH released during biomass 4\nburning of the whole project area would be 16 tCO -e each year. Therefore, as GHG emissions from 2\nfossil fuel combustion, GHG emissions from biomass burning can reasonably be neglected.\nEmissions from enteric fermentation\nThis item represents the major GHG source inside project in the baseline scenario. As mentioned above,\n3\u2019960 heads of cattle pre-existed before project start and then were killed at project start. Thus, the\ndifference between GHG emissions from enteric fermentation in the reference scenario shall be\nsignificant compared with project scenario.\nHowever, in the project scenario, some animals of neighboring fazendas are present inside project area.\nThe neighboring animals are authorized inside project area for weed control and to generate additional\nincomes from land renting. Thus, some cattle are still present inside project area with a low mean annual\npresence of 822 heads since project start.\nTherefore, even with animals still present inside project area, the difference of GHG emissions from\nenteric fermentation between reference scenario and project scenario will be significant, as a\nbuffalo emits more than 1 tCO -e.year-1, and therefore will be estimated following IPCC GL 2006 in 2\naccordance with VCS recommendations.\nEmissions from the decomposition of dead wood\nDead wood is a main compartment in the reference scenario and the project scenario as natural forest was\nslashed and burnt by the former landowner in order to open pastures for cattle grazing activities, and the\nlying dead wood left on site.\nIn the reference scenario, dead wood is burnt year after year through pasture management by fire. The\nremaining burnt dead wood participates to the process of decomposition. In the project scenario the dead\nwood is neither displaced nor burnt. Therefore, it completely participates to the process of decomposition.\nIn consequence, it can reasonably be argued that GHG emissions from dead wood burning in the\nreference scenario are almost equivalent to GHG emissions from dead wood decomposition in the project\nscenario considering that CH is the main GHG involved in both processes. 4\nMoreover, the inputs of dead wood from the management of forest plantations shall not lead to significant\nadditional GHG emissions considering the low amounts of GHG released during decomposition of dead\n\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-AR-PDD) - Version 02\n____________________________________________________________________________________\nC DM \u2013 Executive Board\nPage 57\nwood, as during biomass burning.

The implementation of methane measurement in rice fields requires the\ninvolvement of experts in this field or at least experienced staff trained by experts\n(i.e. from research institutions). These guidelines cannot replace expertise in\nsetting up chamber measurements. They rather set minimum requirements that\nserve for standardizing the conditions under which methane emissions are\nmeasured for projects under this methodology.\nThe closed chamber measurement requires the involvement of technicians trained by\nexperts from Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences under the jurisdiction of the Anhui\nAgricultural Bureau. Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences is a comprehensive\nagricultural research institution directly under the provincial government. The expert who is\nthe leader of the experiment has a doctoral degree and her field of study is rice cultivation\nand GHG monitoring32.

Hence the formula above is only applied to multiply the 5.2 tonnes\nof carbon per hectare (adjusted from Meijer, 1999), which is the conservative\nvalue of the carbon stock in the stratum \u2018banana plantation\u2019, with the combined\narea A of stratum \u2018Planted Area\u2019 and \u2018Regenerating Area\u2019.

It is possible to combine Steps 1 and 2 if field\ninstruments (e.g., a relascope) that measure the volume of each tree directly are applied.\n.\nStep 3: Choose appropriate values for BEF.\nStep 4: Convert the volume of the commercial timber component of trees into carbon stock in\naboveground biomass via basic wood density D, the BEF and the carbon fraction using Eq. 5.

However, due to the difficulty of determining the independence\nof plot data within individual homogeneous polygons (i.e. a specifically similar forest type,\nsite, and age), it will be necessary to only calculate a single carbon density observation for\neach individual polygon sampled; either through the use of a single plot within that polygon,\nor calculation of the mean of multiple plots within that polygon. Throughout these\ncalculations a plot observation, subscript i, is defined to represent the mean of all plots\nwithin a given polygon.\nThe project-level uncertainty factor is calculated as follows:\nStep 1 \u2013 Calculate the average percent model error (E ) for the project based on the M\naverage area-weighted difference between measured values in monitored plot observations\nand model-predicted values using Equations 60a,b. In the case where analysis units have\nbeen used for stratification, the difference between the plot observation and model-\npredicted value (both expressed on a per hectare basis) for a given analysis unit (y ) is d,h,i\nweighted by the area of its associated analysis unit (A , )(Eq. 60a). The use of an area- PRJ h\nweighting factor places more emphasis on analysis units that represent a relatively larger\nproportion of the total project area.\nE = 100 \u2022 (\u2211 y \/ \u2211(A , \u2022 y )) (60a) M d,h,i PRJ h m,h,i\nWhere,\nThe summation is across all plot observations, i, and across all analysis units , h;\ny = A , \u2022 (y - y ) (60b) d,h,i PRJ h m,h,i p,h,i\nE = Mean model error for the project (%) M\ny = the area-weighted difference between measured and predicted carbon storage in d,h,i\nanalysis unit, h, plot observation, i (t C)\n102\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\ny = carbon storage measured in analysis unit, h, plot observation, i (t C ha-1) m,h,i\ny = carbon storage predicted by model for analysis unit , h, plot observation, i (t C ha-1) p,h,i\nA = area of project analysis unit, h (ha) PRJ,h\nStep 2 \u2013 Calculate the inventory error (E) at a 90 percent confidence interval expressed as I\na percentage of the mean area-weighted inventory estimate from the measured plots.\nThis methodology was designed to accommodate complex landscapes consisting of\nhundreds to thousands of polygons, which can be further grouped into analysis units.\nInventory error is estimated based upon the difference between modeled and measured\nvalues for monitoring plots established in polygons or in polygons grouped within analysis\nunits.\nInventory error, E, is estimated by first calculating the standard error of the area-weighted I\ndifferences between the plot observation measurement and the associated model-predicted\ncarbon storage (both on a per hectare basis) for analysis units or polygons. The standard\nerror is then multiplied by the t-value for the 90 percent confidence interval. Finally E is I\nexpressed in relative terms (in Equation 60c) by dividing the 90% confidence interval of the\narea-weighted differences between predicted and measured values in all plots by the area-\nweighted average of the measured values in all monitoring plots.\nE = 100 \u2022 [SE * 1.654 \/ ((1\/N) \u2022 \u2211(A , \u2022 y ))] (60c) I PRJ h m,h,i\nWhere,\nE = Inventory error for the project (%) I\nSE= the project level standard error of the area weighted differences between measured\nplot observation and predicted values of carbon storage.\nN= total number of plot observations in all analysis units or polygons28"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

The spatial extent of the project electricity\nsystem consists of the power plants that are physically connected through transmission and\ndistribution lines to the project activity and that can be dispatched without significant transmission\nconstraints. The project is connected to the Glow grid which in turn is connected to the national\ngrid. Therefore, the national grid is considered as the ultimate connected grid. The spatial extent\nfor the heat (steam) system is similar, including the heat\/steam generating systems that are\nphysically connected to the project activity and that can be displaced without significant\nconstraints. The heat (steam) requirements of the project are met by the steam extracted from the\ncogeneration plants of Glow grid. As the emissions get accounted in the electricity component\ntherefore to avoid double counting and applying conservative principle the emission factor for\nsteam has been considered as zero. The fuel requirement is for incineration purpose.

Due to the harvesting reported in this PD and the Loss\nReport, 12 PAs were evaluated separately from the remainder. That risk report, Non-\nPermanence Risk Sub-Report KE001-L, failed. But for the reversal in KE001-L, there\nwould have been an increase of 19,505 tonnes in the remainder of the PD and the risk\nreport for the remaining PAs had a risk of 1.0. However, since there was a reversal, KE\nVCS-001 is not eligible for any credits.

The resulting OM Emission Factor is;\nEF = 0.65613 grid,OMsimple\nBuild margin (BM)\nAs mentioned above we have preferred the Option 1, calculating the Build Margin Emission factor, \u201cex\nante\u201d, for the first crediting period.\nBetween the SET and SET , the sample group that comprises the larger annual generation is 5-units \u226520%\nSET , hence the set of capacity additions in the electricity system that comprise 20% of the system \u226520%\ngeneration is used.\nThe amount of electricity produced by the SET is calculated to be 4,288.65 GWh. (= AEG 5-units SET-5-\n). units\nThe gross electricity generation in year 2010 is taken as reference for determination of plants that\ncomprise 20% of the system generation. The gross generation in year 2010 was 211,207.70 GWh\n(Table 12) in 2010 out of this amount 7,053.40 GWh was identified30 to be produced by projects that\n30 A list of units providing electricty to the year 2010 Turkish Electricity Grid is provided as an Annex 1 to the most recent\nCapacity Projection report published by TEIAS (http:\/\/212.175.131.171\/projeksiyon\/KAPASITEPROJEKSIYONU2011.pdf). We\nhave checked and identified the ones that have claimed VERs by comparing the list to the Gold Standard registry\n(https:\/\/gs2.apx.com\/myModule\/rpt\/myrpt.asp?r=111) and VCS Project Database (http:\/\/www.vcsprojectdatabase.org). This list\nis provided to the validating DOE.\nv3.1 35\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nclaimed VERs, excluding this number from the gross generation we end up with 195,992.70 GWh of\nelectricity which is our AEG and 20% of that amount is calculated as 39,198.54 GWh. TOTAL\nComparing the AEG and 20% of AEG , it is seen that 20% of AEG , is higher than SET-5-units TOTAL TOTAL\nAEG SET-5-units.\nThereforethe 20% of AEG with a value of 39,198.54 GWh is to be compared to the capacity TOTAL\nadditions in the recent years.\nSumming up electricity the generations of all the plants added to the Turkish National Grid in 2010\nand 2009, but excluding the projects that claimed VERs, their total generation is 47,745.76 GWh.\nThe total generation by the power plants added in year 2010 is 26,256.04 GWh which is still less than\nthe 20% of AEG value of 39,198.54 GWh, however we are unable to identify the date of addition TOTAL\nof the units that are added to the Grid in year 2009 to complete the amount of electricity added to the\nGrid by year 2010 power plants. Therefore, with a conservative approach we are considering all the\nunits added in year 2009 and the AEG value we are using in our BM calculation is 47,745.76 SET Sample\nGWh and is greater than the 20% of the total generation, So only the power plants added in the last 2\nyears, excluding those claiming VER credits, are used in the calculations. As there is no power unit\nolder than 10 years this number is being used for Build Margin Calculations.\nThe lists of most recent capacity additions to the grid by year and their average and firm generation\ncapacities for the years 2010, and 2009 are available as Annex-2 to the capacity projection reports\npublished in the TEIAS web page. Also the annual generation capacity data for each plant is not\navailable on the statistics page of TE\u0130A\u015e. The data for the years 200931 and 201032 are taken from\nthe TE\u0130A\u015e Capacity Projection Reports which are also available in another section of the TE\u0130A\u015e\nwebsite. For the capacity additions, the firm generation capacities of the power plants are used. The\nunits that are taken out of the grid are not taken into consideration. All the data used for calculations\ncould be found in Annex-2 (see Table 8a and Table8b).\nAccording to the tool in terms of vintage of data, a project participant can choose either the ex-ante\noption or the ex-post option. As explained above, out of these two options, Option 1 is selected. For\nthe first crediting period, the build margin emission factor is calculated ex-ante based on the most\nrecent information available on units already built for sample group m at the time of CDM-PDD\nsubmission to the DOE for validation. For the second crediting period, the build margin emission\nfactor will be updated based on the most recent information available on units already built at the time\nof submission of the request for renewal of the crediting period to the DOE. For the third crediting\nperiod, the build margin emission factor calculated for the second crediting period will be used. This\noption does not require monitoring the emission factor during the crediting period.\nElectric efficiency rates\nThere is no complete and up-to-date data regarding the electrical efficiency of thermal power plants\nthat supply electricity to the Turkish National Grid system. Therefore the default values provided in\nAnnex 1(Default efficiency factors for power plants) of the Methodological Tool to calculate the\nemission factor for an electricity system (Version 3.0.0) (EB 70, Annex 22) is utilised, in a very\n31 TE\u0130A\u015e Capacity Projection Report 20010-2019\n(http:\/\/www.teias.gov.tr\/projeksiyon\/KAPASITE%20PROJEKSIYONU%202010.pdf)\n32 http:\/\/www.teias.gov.tr\/projeksiyon\/KapasiteProjeksiyonu2011.doc\nv3.1 36"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

Both sources, therefore, show a significance level >5% and thus will be considered in calculations of\nreductions in net GHG emissions by project activities.\nFor the project baseline scenario, the significance level was calculated for potential emission sources as well\nas activities that may decrease the emissions expected in the baseline scenario; these are, respectively: (i)\nCH emissions from biomass burning and (ii) decrease in emissions expected in the baseline scenario, by 4\nlogging without the use of fire (durable goods). Was also calculated the significance of a possible emission\nsource that could lead to a reduction in avoided emissions under the PCFS scenario: (i) emissions from\ndeforestation in leakage management areas.\nBelow, an analysis of identified emissions sources.\nBaseline Scenario\n(I) CH4 from burning biomass\nTo determine the significance of CH4 emitted through the burning of biomass, we used the equation\npresented in Step 6.2 of the Methodology VM0015 v1.0:\n(10)\nWhereby:\nEBBCO2icl, t = CO2 emissions per hectare from burning of biomass per forest class in year t icl: *\nCO2e ha-1\nEBBCH4icl, t = CH4 emissions per hectare from burning of biomass per forest class in year t icl: *\nCO2e ha-1\nERCH4 = Emission rate for CH4 (IPCC default value = 0.012).\nGWPCH4 = Global Warming Potential for CH4 (IPCC default value = 21 for the first commitment\nperiod).\nThe result of this equation gives the value of 52.53 tCO2e*ha-1. However, a combustion efficiency of 50% is\nassumed (Step 6.2, VM0015 v1.0 ) such that CH4 emissions represent 4.6% of the emissions per hectare.\nThis source has been shown not significant and conservatively will not be counted as an avoided emission in\nthe PCFS.\n(ii) Durable Wood Products\nWe calculated the significance level of potential logging that does not use fire (eg. for the production of\ndurable goods like furniture, etc.) and hence does not produce GHG emissions. To perform the calculations\nwe used the following assumptions:\n\uf0b7 Net Emission Factor per hectare: 586.8 tCO2\n\uf0b7 Logging intensity 30m3\/ha141\n\uf0b7 Coefficient of volumetric efficiency: 45%142\n\uf0b7 Wood density = 0.59 t\/m3 143\n\uf0b7 Carbon density = 0.485 tC \/ t biomass144\n\uf0b7 Conversion factor for CO e = 44\/12145 2\n141 Putz, 2008\n142 CONAMA, 2009\n143 Nogueira, 2008\n144 Silva, 2007\n145 IPCC, 2006\n91\n\nVCS Project Description Template\n\uf0b7 Permanence factor of CO e by the use of wood in durable goods: 30m3\/ha * 45% * 0.59 * 0.485 2\n* 3.666 = 14.16 tCO2e\/ha\n\uf0b7 Calculation of the significance level: 14.16 tCO2 \/ 586.8 tCO2 = 0.024 (2.4%)\nAnd, it is assumed that logging would occur at an average intensity of 30m3\/ha, according to known\nexploitation intensitiesin tropical forests. Of total production, wood represents 45% of the extracted volume.\nBy applying the values for wood density and the carbon content of the biomass, the amount of carbon\nremoved from the forest for the production of durable goods may be estimated.\nIt is important to point out that the logging intensity values used here are extremely conservative because in\na degraded forest as found in TISS, a logging intensity of 30m3\/ha of commercial species is unlikely.\nThe result of the calculation of significance (2.4%) indicates that this activity will not be counted because it is\nbelow the level of significance established by the Methodology VM0015 v1.0.\nPCFS Scenario\n(I) Leakage Management Areas\nAs previously mentioned, it is expected that with project implementation there will be an increase of carbon\nstocks in areas under leakage management as reforestation and agroforestry activities will be encouraged\nand promoted by the project proponents.\nIf a very pessimistic scenario is assumed, whereby carbon stocks in leakage management areas totaling\n3,416 ha decreased by 50% (from 47 tCO2\/ha to 23.5 tCO2\/ha) through deforestation caused by the Paiter-\nSuru\u00ed, the total emissions from this loss would represent 4.0% of expected emission reductions in the project\nscenario (per hectare) and therefore is not considered significant and will not be counted as an potential\nemission source in the project scenario.\n92"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

Previously, each one has to subtract their emissions by\nburning of fossil fuels and the incorporation of nitrogen.\nThe retention rate is determined according to the risk classification of the project, using the VCS\ntool for AFOLU of Risk of Non Permanence. According to the calculations, it has a total\npercentage of 10% buffer.\nTherefore the retention of Buffer Credits to year 2018 should be:\nBuffer = {(11,419,937 \u2013 0*) \u2013 0**} x 10% = 1,141,994 tCO UNPLANNED 2\nAnd to 2046 (end of the accreditation period):\nBuffer = {(27,626,600 \u2013 0*) \u2013 0**} x 10% = 2,762,660 tCO UNPLANNED 2\n* It was already explained that the emissions due to the burning of fossil fuels and the\nincorporation of nitrogen fertilizers in baseline were not considered.\n** There are no changes in carbon stocks in Scenario with Project (ex - ante) due to the planned\nprevention activities, and because none of them have considered using fertilizers.\nUncertainty Analysis\nThe analysis of uncertainty of carbon stocks was developed according to the module X-UNC.\nThe assumptions made were:\nv3.0 1 62\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n- The uncertainty from emissions should be accounted as zero, since we used a conservative\nnumber (55%) in its calculation, and it is the percentage taken from literature.\n- The uncertainty from Pools: Dead-wood, Litter, Soil organic, Wood products; and sources:\nFossil fuel combustion and N O emissions from nitrogen application, were not analysed as 2\nthey are not included in baseline calculations.\n- The uncertainty resulting from calculations to estimate aboveground biomass, based on\nmeasured tree variables (DBH, specific density), is already included in the biomass equation\nitself\nEstimation of Verified Carbon Units\n- Considering what is indicated in the module, to know the verifiable carbon units in time t, the\nadjustment by uncertainty should be carried out as well as the reduction by risk buffer.

The implementation of methane measurement in rice fields requires the involvement\nof experts in this field or at least experienced staff trained by experts (i.e. from\nresearch institutions). These guidelines cannot replace expertise in setting up\nchamber measurements. They rather set minimum requirements that serve for\nstandardizing the conditions under which methane emissions are measured for\nprojects under this methodology.\nThe closed chamber measurement requires the involvement of technicians trained by experts\nfrom Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences under the jurisdiction of the Anhui Agricultural\nBureau. Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences is a comprehensive agricultural research\ninstitution directly under the provincial government. The expert who is the leader of the\nexperiment has a doctoral degree and her field of study is rice cultivation and GHG\nmonitoring36.

The project is implemented on non-forest land as mentions above, there is no grazing \/\nfarming activity existed before the project activity. Fertilization and watering are not going to take\nplace, neither. Therefore, there is no expected leakage due to the displacement of agricultural\nactivityfromtheprojectactivity.\nTherefore, there is no expected leakage due to decrease in carbon stock in the carbon pools of\nthe land and change in soil organic carbon stock.

These ex-ante estimates are for the entire\ndesignated geographic area based on BEM estimates for the first PAI in Kamlapar. This assumes that\nfuture PAIs will have similarly stocked forests and harvest areas to this first PAI, which may not be the\ncase due to uncertainty for future PAIs. However, per the methodology, ex-ante estimates are only\nrequired to determine whether changes within carbon pools or increased GHG emissions due to project\nactivities are insignificant. As the project has only conservatively excluded selected pools such as SDW\nand LDW will account for all significant emissions due to project activities, these ex-ante estimates are\nonly meant to provide potential crediting estimates across the project lifetime.\nEstimated baseline emissions will change as future PAIs are added to the project. The addition of future\nPAIs will require delineation of the area of the PAA as well as an inventory of carbon stocks within that\nspecific PAA. Thus, reported baseline emissions are only an estimate that assumes that future PAIs will\nhave similar areas and carbon stocks to the original PAI. This design for estimating ex-ante baseline\nemissions across all PAIs is the same as was done for ex-ante project emissions (see Section 4.2.4).\nFuture reported baseline emissions will likely change significantly at verification events due to the\naddition of new PAIs and inventory results. Project emissions will vary based on actual monitored\ndisturbances within each PAA.\n89\n\n[['', '5', '', '', '1,523,244', '', '', '19,530', '', '', '0', '', '', '1,503,714', ''], ['', '6', '', '', '1,500,952', '', '', '19,530', '', '', '0', '', '', '1,481,421', ''], ['', '7', '', '', '1,293,835', '', '', '26,041', '', '', '0', '', '', '1,267,795', ''], ['', '8', '', '', '1,845,782', '', '', '32,551', '', '', '0', '', '', '1,813,231', ''], ['', '9', '', '', '1,858,083', '', '', '32,551', '', '', '0', '', '', '1,825,532', ''], ['', '10', '', '', '1,632,365', '', '', '39,061', '', '', '0', '', '', '1,593,304', ''], ['', '11', '', '', '2,170,003', '', '', '45,571', '', '', '0', '', '', '2,124,432', ''], ['', '12', '', '', '2,120,914', '', '', '45,571', '', '', '0', '', '', '2,075,343', ''], ['', '13', '', '', '1,823,037', '', '', '52,081', '', '', '0', '', '', '1,770,956', ''], ['', '14', '', '', '2,330,369', '', '', '58,591', '', '', '0', '', '', '2,271,778', ''], ['', '15', '', '', '2,270,602', '', '', '58,591', '', '', '0', '', '', '2,212,011', ''], ['', '16', '', '', '1,951,454', '', '', '58,591', '', '', '0', '', '', '1,892,862', ''], ['', '17', '', '', '2,372,912', '', '', '65,101', '', '', '0', '', '', '2,307,810', ''], ['', '18', '', '', '2,326,222', '', '', '65,101', '', '', '0', '', '', '2,261,120', ''], ['', '19', '', '', '1,975,567', '', '', '71,612', '', '', '0', '', '', '1,903,956', ''], ['', '20', '', '', '2,389,585', '', '', '78,122', '', '', '0', '', '', '2,311,463', ''], ['', '21', '', '', '2,344,709', '', '', '78,122', '', '', '0', '', '', '2,266,588', ''], ['', '22', '', '', '2,005,590', '', '', '84,632', '', '', '0', '', '', '1,920,958', ''], ['', '23', '', '', '2,398,849', '', '', '91,142', '', '', '0', '', '', '2,307,707', ''], ['', '24', '', '', '2,357,572', '', '', '91,142', '', '', '0', '', '', '2,266,430', ''], ['', '25', '', '', '2,013,246', '', '', '97,652', '', '', '0', '', '', '1,915,593', ''], ['', '26', '', '', '2,395,149', '', '', '104,162', '', '', '0', '', '', '2,290,987', ''], ['', '27', '', '', '2,359,385', '', '', '104,162', '', '', '0', '', '', '2,255,223', ''], ['', '28', '', '', '2,020,955', '', '', '110,672', '', '', '0', '', '', '1,910,283', ''], ['', '29', '', '', '2,398,732', '', '', '117,183', '', '', '0', '', '', '2,281,550', ''], ['', '30', '', '', '2,858,073', '', '', '123,693', '', '', '0', '', '', '2,734,381', ''], ['', 'Total', '', '', '56,874,569', '', '', '1,783,779', '', '', '0', '', '', '55,090,789', '']]\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\n90\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\nTable 13.

As suggested\nby the tool, it is assumed that the implementation of the project activity increases the SOC content of the\nlands from the pre-project level to the level that is equal to the steady-state SOC content under native\nvegetation. The increase in SOC content in the project scenario takes place at a constant rate over a period\nof 20 years from the year of planting. The project meets the applicability conditions of this tool in the area\nmanaged with Pine plantations:\n\u2022 the areas of land to which the tool is applied do not fall into wetland category, do not contain\norganic soils and are not subject to any of the land management practices and application of\ninputs listed in Tables 1 and 2 of the tool;\n\u2022 Since the land use prior to project start was grassland, only Table 2 applies. For the\ntemperate warm moist climate region corresponding to the project activity, none of the three\ncombinations included in Table 2 are applicable;\n\u2022 litter remains on site and is not removed and soil disturbance is in accordance with\nappropriate conservation practices, limited to site preparation and not repeated within 20\nyears.\nTable 19. Parameters used for estimation of SOC\nSOC at the beginning of the project (SOC ) is estimated by multiplying the factors in Table 19 by the INITIAL,i\nreference SOC. As per the tool, a loss in SOC (SOC ) is applied in the case that soil disturbance LOSS,i\noccurs on more than 10 per cent of the land area, which is the case of Weyerhaeuser Uruguay project.\nThe following methodological formula is used for calculating the annual change in SOC stock:\nSOC \u2212(SOC \u2212SOC )\ndSOC = REF,i INICIAL,i LOSS,i\nt,i 20\nv3.0 82"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2003: 31966.30411, 2004: 187957.4609, 2005: 447186.3884, 2006: 642295.3836, 2007: 790320.1534, 2008: 889692.3478, 2009: 855398.5727, 2010: 794462.7096, 2011: 774244.4027, 2012: 654110.6264, 2013: 217727.6147, 2014: -28181.50411, 2015: 82532.95342, 2016: -57289.54485, 2017: 360491.2764, 2018: 524664.6466, 2019: 281452.4329, 2020: -838819.2629, 2021: -1212377.764, 2022: -765044.9753, 2023: -997365.874, 2024: -41245.15122, 2025: 388011.5731, 2026: 559087.3425, 2027: 144906.1507, 2028: 574908.3053, 2029: 153503.9632, 2030: 161551.5096, 2031: 34189.6411, 2032: 149609.0883, 2033: -2340.89104, 2034: 387266.3397, 2035: 235213.7178, 2036: -852860.1173, 2037: -1281808.683, 2038: -777847.3123, 2039: -1111237.764, 2040: -56694.45918, 2041: 469881.1332, 2042: 702658.3123, 2043: 710867.5233, 2044: 775027.8017, 2045: 573986.3544, 2046: 14827.4137, 2047: -27451.25479, 2048: 124398.1861, 2049: -69848.8546, 2050: 418278.8712, 2051: 349144.6904, 2052: -726759.6797, 2053: -1165169.485, 2054: -723479.0301, 2055: -1014657.751, 2056: -11113.11703, 2057: 465556.0184, 2058: 628442.8658, 2059: 700157.0192, 2060: 654373.1896, 2061: 138520.0159, 2062: 42808.1589, 2063: -30664.06301, 2064: 87391.82809, 2065: -2957.304798, 2066: 298645.5452, 2067: 86580.36438, 2068: -976666.4081, 2069: -1233803.362, 2070: -770120.1479, 2071: -925617.2822, 2072: 100275.2837, 2073: 99328.64503, 2074: 668211.2082, 2075: 759234.8932, 2076: 760285.5159, 2077: 607082.2184, 2078: 103803.0466, 2079: -112926.3753, 2080: 69224.99566, 2081: -129855.5463, 2082: 274994.1452, 2083: 183729.7151, 2084: -795818.15, 2085: -1230550.124, 2086: -725905.474, 2087: -1108168.542, 2088: -156811.1492, 2089: 347546.9519, 2090: 639843.9945, 2091: 618919.6274, 2092: 752251.2349, 2093: 679675.2144, 2094: 232812.0247, 2095: 24660.98356, 2096: 150689.7288, 2097: 7005.287671, 2098: 371107.5205, 2099: 231252.2959, 2100: -821429.0337, 2101: -1208023.865, 2102: -811919.9205, 2103: -105428.5041}"}]}
