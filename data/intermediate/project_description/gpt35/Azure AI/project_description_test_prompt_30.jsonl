The proposed project achieves CO emission 2\nreduction by replacing electricity generated by fossil fuel fired power plant connected into the\nNCPG.\nFor the proposed project, the scenario existing prior to the start of the implementation of the\nproject activity is NCPG providing the same electricity service as the proposed project. The\nbaseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation of the\nproject activity.\nThe QHW Project consists of 12 wind turbine generators each with a capacity of 1300kW and 3\nturbines each with 250 kW capacity. The total installed capacity is 16.35MW. The implementation\nof the project was accomplished in November 2003.\nFor the calculation of the emission reductions of the project the production of one of the three 250\nkW turbines has never been considered and also will not be part of the future VCS-QHW-Project.\nThis turbine was part of a pilot plant, that had been built in 2000, partly financed with a grant\nprovided by the German Ministry for Economic Development and Cooperation in a so called\nPublic-Private Partnership Program. Therefore the VCS-project consists of 14 wind turbines with\na capacity of 16.1 MW.\nThe annual electricity output estimation from 2014 onwards (20,757,555kwh) is calculated as the\naverage grid electricity output1 from 2009 to 2012 (Year 2009: 20,883,380kwh; Year 2010:\n22,239,645kwh; Year 2011: 19,663,138kwh; Year 2012: 20,244,056kwh).

{"input":"Question: What is the project summary, province, country, latitude, and longitude of this project?\n\nContext: \n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\n1.12 Project Location\nAll areas included within the Project Area, and therefore all areas to undergo bamboo planting activities\nare riparian buffer zones, under the state ownership of the Government of Rwanda, and under the\njurisdiction of the Rwanda Water Resources Board. Shape files used for the delineation of the riparian\nbuffer zones included within the project area are official government files.\nUnder the terms of the agreement between the project proponent and the Rwanda Water Resources\nBoard, the project location for the 500km of riparian buffer zones for the 2022 planting season was\nprovided in advance of validation. All areas are first assessed for eligibility, based off historical and\ncurrent landcover. Within such eligible areas, ground truthing is then required to define the exact planting\narea, due to a range of aspects that may mean eligible areas are not suitable for planting. Such areas\ninclude accessibility, where the likelihood of landslides is too high, where there is no suitable soil within\nthe riparian area for planting, or other aspects that can only be determined by the project\u2019s team of GIS\ntechnicians on the ground.\nFollowing validation the 2022 proposed planting area was subsequently ground truthed and planted\nduring Q4 of 2022, during which the validation process has been ongoing.\nAs a result, the Project Area relating to the 500km of riparian plantings that occurred in 2022 are shown\nbelow, and the associated KML file provided. The position of the first planting instance within Rwanda is\nshown in Figure 5 below.\nThe 500km of riparian buffer zones to be planted during the 2023 planting season will be ground truthed\nin advance of the Q4 2023 planting season and finalized during the land preparation process.\n17\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nFigure 4 Project Area \u2013 1st Planting Instance\n18\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nFigure 5 KMZ Image of Project Location of the 1st Planting Instance\n19\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nThe project area in the 1st project instance covers four districts, namely Ngororero, Karongi, Muhanga\nand Ruhango. The total project area for the 1st planting instance represents 583.9km of rivers that are\ncategorized as \u201csmall\u201d and therefore will only have a single line of planting on each bank. This 583.9km\nproject area is therefore greater than the total area to be planted (approximately 500km) allowing for non\nplantable areas (such as rocky patches or areas where the river bank is too steep for planting) that can\nonly be determined during the planting season as the planting teams walk each river bank.\nAs such, the final project area and associated KML files are determined ex post, and this mapping\ncomprises an important part of project monitoring activities, as further detailed in Section 5 below.\nEntities Involved\nThe project proponent is also the project implementing entity. All project activities are carried out by the\nproject proponent by a full operating team that is based within the proximity of the project boundaries.\nThe structure of such involvement is provided in the organizational chart below.

Furthermore, unsustainable fishing and shellfish collection practices, mainly by international\nIUU trawlers, have diminished the fish stock, forcing local communities to harvest additional mangrove\nwood to be sold as an alternative income. Throughout the project area, mangrove overexploitation and\ndeforestation have led to significant coastline erosion. Communities have tried to reinforce their\nshorelines over the past 20 years to stop erosion while continuing to harvest mangroves, but failed to\nstop soil loss (e.g., village in Sittia; Figure 1).\nFigure 1.

To prevent the waste water from factory contaminating Xi River, from\nstone processing will be recycled after precipitation and flocculation; the waste water from concrete\nstirring and washing will be recycled after precipitation and neutralization; the amount of oily waste\nwater will be limited due to the short application period and it will be treated regularly and\nflocculated; the living sewage will be used for irrigation after processing. These measures are\npractical and sufficient to prevent the pollution of Xi River.\n(cid:122) Air\nThere will be some dust pollution from stone processing, blast and transportation.

The\nmain ecosystem types range from semi-desert and shrub-grass steppes to monte\nsteppes, mainly characterized by the absence of trees and presence of xerophyte plants,\nincluding tussock (Festuca,Stipa), short grasses(Poa,Carex) and a variety of shrubs.\nInterspersed throughout the dominant steppe landscape are a small proportion of wet\nmeadows with more mesic plant communities comprising mostly grasses, sedges, and\nrushes.Nothofagusmay occupy the transition zonefrom the steppe to higher elevation\nand\/or wetter forest areas (Cibils and Borrelli, 2005;Peri, et.al., 2016).\nCurrent and historical land-use:\nThe extra-Andean Patagonian ecosystems evolved under grazing of the only native\nungulate herbivores, called Guanacos (Lamaguanicoe),alongside with aboriginal\nhunter-gatherer peoples who performed migratory hunting of these animals. Guanaco\npopulations migrated seasonally, allowing the land to rest for long periods at a time,\npromoting regrowth of grasses and other vegetation. In the late nineteenth century,\nEuropean settlers introduced domesticated grazing animals and established private\nproperty, limiting aboriginal peoples\u2019 opportunity for continuing migratory hunting.\nCommercial sheep farming became a prominent industry, peaking in 1952 with over 21\nmillion heads, and declining to 8.5 million in 1999 (Cibils and Borrelli, 2005).

It is a grouped project.  The initial activity instances comprise 20,123 hectares that will generate on average an estimated 24,952 tCO2e of emissions reductions annually.  It is expected ultimately to comprise >500,000 hectares and generate on average an estimated 620,000 of emissions reductions annually. Improved grazing will increase the rest and rotation on pastures above baseline practices and reduce unrestricted grazing by livestock. Pastures will be grazed with higher livestock densities followed by longer periods of rest, increasing both plant productivity and soil carbon inputs relative to baseline conditions. This results in the sequestration of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere to the soil. \\r\\nLand operators are provided funding to increase fencing and water access needed to create more and smaller pastures and to provide the added labor needed to manage more frequent livestock movements. Project participants are required to manage for concentrated animal impact on small pastures with a focus on extended rest periods allowing for regrowth and recovery of leaf tissue, seed establishment, and replenishment of root reserves. In the baseline scenario, the pastures are larger and the livestock movement among pastures is less frequent. This allows grazing animals to select for preferred perennial species, which then become overgrazed and insufficient rest periods favor the encroachment by shrubs, annual grasses, and larger occurrence of bare ground.\\r\\nThe grouped project is on eligible grasslands of Argentina. The project area consists of grassland grazed by livestock on participating farms. Soils throughout the project area are primarily coarse-textured sand to sandy loam and have been losing carbon for over 100 years due to the continuous, selective grazing under the baseline scenario. Consequently, soils in the project area are modelled to have a high potential to store carbon under intensive, high rotation grazing management.', 'project_state_province': 'Argentinian Patagonia', 'project_country': 'Argentina', 'project_latitude': -51.62, 'project_longitude': -69.22}"}

In the event that conflicts emerge over community land, the PP would support the\nlegal process and ensure that it is concluded before including these land owners in the project.\nAs the carbon agreements are signed with treegrower associations, their internal constitution\nwould govern how they manage their members.

This methodology is applicable under the following conditions:\n(a) The land subject to the project activity does not fall in wetland category.\nThe project area does not include any wetland areas.\n(b) Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10 per cent\nof area in each of the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project\nboundary:\n(i) Land containing organic soils.\nThere are no organic soils located within the project area.\n(ii) Land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and\nreceives inputs listed in appendices 1 and 2 to this methodology.\nAppendix 1 lists cropland areas that are subject to different management practices (full tillage,\nreduced tillage and no-till) as potential inputs (high with manure).\nThe project area, particularly the out-grower afforestation area, does include previously cultivated\nareas, but high levels of manure where not applied. Livestock are not common in the project\nregion.\nThe project area, particularly the conservation areas identified for reforestation, do include\ngrassland areas, however these are generally degraded and are not natural grasslands. Rather\nthey are the outcome of historical deforestation and forest degradation. The elephant grass\n(Pennisetum purpureum) observed in the project area is a common colonizer of cleared areas\n(Hamilton 1984).\n4.

Identify barrie rs that would prevent the implementation of  the project type of the proposed \nproject activity: \n \n1. Power generation projects using new renewable energy technologies face significant barriers in most \ncountries. Many industrialised countries have esta blished financial support systems to encourage such \nenvironmentally friendly power generation. However, such support systems can be expensive and are not \ngenerally available in developing countries. \n \nWhile the government of China has supported renewa ble energy sources for more than a decade, the \ndevelopment of wind power projects has not been very  fast. Indeed, most of the wind projects in China do \nnot receive satisfactory tariffs and are applying for CDM registration. \n \nBarriers are identified and assessed below. \n \nInvestment barriers \n \nInternational development aid, e.g. from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and KfW, as well as \ngovernment tariff support have been used in China since 1993 to encourage the development of the wind \npower industry in the country. However, in recent year s, the provisions of such soft loans and subsidised \ngovernment interest rates have gra dually decreased, the windfarm developers now have to apply for more \ncommercial loans, furthermore, for a windfarm project only with attractive financial expectation, can the \ncommercial loan be obtained in time successfully. \n \nIn China the approximate investment costs of the windfarm is about 8000-10000 RMB Yuan per kW, \nwhich is double that of the thermal plant, furtherm ore the utilization hours of windfarm are about from \n2000 to 2500 hours, which is about one third of that of the thermal plant. Besides the common worse \nfinance condition than the thermal plant project, for the proposed project, to best suit the local wind \nresource, the 850kW turbine of Vestas (V52-850) was se lected by bidding, which is more expensive than \nother turbine per kW. The total investment cost per kW of the proposed project is 10,587 RMB Yuan, \nsignificantly higher than that of all thermal plants.  \n \nAll these factors above make the  financial  return  rate   of  the  investment  and  the  ability  of  loan \nrepayment of the proposed project at a lower level. Without the help of CDM, the proposed project would \nface the difficulty in obtaining the commercial loan. Indeed, the potential revenue of selling CERs from \nthe CDM project played an important role in the loan application and finally assisted in the decision of the \nBank of Communications to take on the loan obligation. \n \nFor the proposed project, additional CDM financing may enable the investment return to be competitive \nwith other projects and also allow the company to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with the \npurchase of equipment from abroad. Having a full realization of this, the developer of the Chifeng \nSaihanba East Windfarm Project started the CDM ap plication process aiming to obtain the additional \nfunding to secure the project financially and institutionally.  \n \nTariff barriers  \n \nA windfarm project is not the least cost option for capacity expansion in the Northeast Power Grid.

By\nadding new wind-powered electric generation to this grid, a mix of other power plants will operate\nless by the equivalent amount of generation produced by the wind turbines. The power plants\naffected by new wind generation are mostly base loaded fossil fuelled power plants. Fossil\nfuelled power plants release carbon dioxide emissions during their operation, and the addition of\nnew wind generation and the resultant displacement of generation from these and other power\nplants will create net GHG emission reductions.\nThe Initial Project Activity Instance is located north of the Lake Region State College in Devils\nLake, North Dakota.

Prior to the first verification, the following steps will be implemented for new project instances added subsequent to validation. Because the project does not\ninvolve the disturbance of soils after plantation, it will not be necessary to implement this procedure for subsequent verifications.\ne. Verify that the lands subject to the activities of the project do not fall in the wetland category;\nFor each new project instance, the project coordinator will require the landholder to present a certificate of land use and tenancy emitted by the corresponding communal authority that indicates that the land is under agricultural use. As explained in Section 2.2.4, cultivated lands and pastures are not classified as\nwetlands. Examples of the format are presented in Annex 19. The land use of each new project instance will be registered in the project database.\nf. Confirm that soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10 per cent of the area in each of the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project boundary:\n(v) Land containing organic soils;\nUtilizing the procedures and formats described in Annex 11 and previously summarized in Section 1.8.3, UNECAFE\u2019s community technicians will delineate and georeference the area of each new project instance, and the project coordinator will create a polygon in vector and KML formats. The coordinator will\nthen superimpose the polygon of each instance on the grouped project area\u2019s soil classification layer in Annex 12 in order to identify each instance\u2019s soil type, which will be registered in the project database.\n(vi) Land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and receives inputs listed in appendices 2 and 3 to this methodology.\nThe coordinator will superimpose the polygon of each new project instance on the grouped project area\u2019s climatic region classification layer in Annex 12 in order to identify the climatic region of each instance, which will be registered in the project database. The coordinator will then repeat the analysis presented\nfor the initial project instances in Section 2.2.4 to identify in which project instances soil disturbance is restricted.\nFor the project instances to which the restriction applies, the coordinator will utilize the register of planted trees to confirm that the project instances have received a planting density of less than 6,250 trees per hectare. This limit was calculated considering a planting-hole size of 40 X 40 cm per tree as indicated in\nAnnex 1, which is equivalent to 0.16 m2 per planted tree (6,250 trees X 0.16 m2 = 1,000 m2, equivalent to 10% of the area of a hectare).\nBecause the project utilizes a maximum initial density of 600 trees per hectares, this density affords enough room for error that it is not possible for the tree planting activities to generate enough disturbance to reach the 10% threshold. Thus, there will be no monitoring of planting-hole size.\n4.2.24 Monitoring of Carbon Stock in Project Trees\n4.2.24.1 Methods selected\nTo estimate carbon stock changes in project trees, the methodological tool AR-TOOL14 indicates that one of the following methods may be selected:\n\uf0b7 Method 6.1 \u201cDifference of two independent stock estimations.\u201d This method is recommended when there is a redistribution of the biomass in a stratum, for example as a result of harvesting, or in the case of Coffee CO , due to non-uniform mortality rates on the project areas and the use of liberation thinning. 2\n\uf0b7 Method 6.2 \u201cDirect estimation of change by re-measurement of sample plots.\u201d This method is applicable in ex-post estimation of change in carbon stock in trees for monitoring of project activities. This method is efficient when there has been no harvest or disturbance that affects the distribution of biomass and\ncarbon in the stratum.\nIn both cases, sample plots are used for the monitoring of carbon in project trees. However, the processes of analysis are distinct. Under method 6.1, different sample plots are established for each monitoring event, and the change in carbon stock in trees is estimated as the difference between two successive and\nindependent carbon stock estimations.\nIn contrast, under method 6.2, the accumulation of carbon for each permanent sample plot in each stratum is obtained by subtracting the value of the previous measurement from the value of the new measurement for each sample plot, and afterwards used to calculate the average carbon capture for each stratum and\nat the project level. Applying method 6.1 on the permanent sample plots provides the same results as calculating the average of the differences per plot; however, the opposite is not possible. The method described in section 6.2 cannot be used with two independent monitoring events with a different set of sample\nplots. This is an important challenge because the use of permanent sample plots for the monitoring of project trees would usually be recommended only if the mortality rates and clearing practices were homogeneous among the different strata of planting configurations. However, it is important to consider that the\ncontinued existence of pre-project trees must also be monitored and that this presents challenges because all pre-project trees cannot be identified and monitored in a cost-effective or practical way. Therefore, the pre-project trees will be monitored within permanent sample plots. Thus, with the objective of reducing\nmonitoring costs, it is proposed that the carbon stocks of project trees, pre-project trees and shrubs all be monitored using the same permanent plots and thus following method 6.1.\nv3.2 152","output":"{'project_methodologies': ['AM0007']}"}

Ltd. The objective of the project is\nelectricity generation using state-of-the-art wind power generation technology and sale of the\nelectricity into the North China Power Grid (NCPG). The proposed project achieves CO emission 2\nreduction by replacing electricity generated by fossil fuel fired power plant connected into the\nNCPG.\nFor the proposed project, the scenario existing prior to the start of the implementation of the\nproject activity is NCPG providing the same electricity service as the proposed project. The\nbaseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation of the\nproject activity.\nThe QHW Project consists of 12 wind turbine generators each with a capacity of 1300kW and 3\nturbines each with 250 kW capacity. The total installed capacity is 16.35MW. The implementation\nof the project was accomplished in November 2003.\nFor the calculation of the emission reductions of the project the production of one of the three 250\nkW turbines has never been considered and also will not be part of the future VCS-QHW-Project.\nThis turbine was part of a pilot plant, that had been built in 2000, partly financed with a grant\nprovided by the German Ministry for Economic Development and Cooperation in a so called\nPublic-Private Partnership Program. Therefore the VCS-project consists of 14 wind turbines with\na capacity of 16.1 MW.\nThe annual electricity output estimation from 2014 onwards (20,757,555kwh) is calculated as the\naverage grid electricity output1 from 2009 to 2012 (Year 2009: 20,883,380kwh; Year 2010:\n22,239,645kwh; Year 2011: 19,663,138kwh; Year 2012: 20,244,056kwh).
