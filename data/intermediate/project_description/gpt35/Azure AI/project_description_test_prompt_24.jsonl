This region is also known as the\nBrazilian Arc of Deforestation. The main deforestation agents acting within the reference region during\nthe historical period were: cattle ranching, mainly producing beef cattle; timber harvesters, acting both\nlegally and illegally; and infrastructure, such as road and highway construction.\nHowever, other planned infrastructure projects will probably increase deforestation pressure in the region\neven more. Those include the construction project of the Ramal Marcelino, for the disposal of wood. This\nalready has the economic and environmental feasibility certificate issued by SEMA in Novo Aripuan\u00e3, the\nmunicipal authorization and the licensing of this project at Amazonas Environmental Protection Institute\n(IPAAM). For this reason, the extension of the branch was considered an important vector of future\ndeforestation within the project area.\nOnce put into practice, these projects will likely affect demographic growth in affected municipalities,\nstimulating new economic activities and expansion of area, which, consequently, will create pressure to\ndeforest further and increase deforestation levels. Thus, revenue from the sale of VCUs is essential for\nthe project activity to compete with profitable alternative land-use scenarios.\nPart of the project area is located within three different Brazilian protected areas, which are part of the\nSouthern Amazon Mosaic. Therefore, the Boa F\u00e9 REDD Project makes an important contribution to the\nconservation of Southern Amazon biodiversity and also to climate regulation in Brazil and South America.\nIn addition to contributing to the long-term conservation of the region, this project also has the function\nof establishing a barrier against the advancement of the Brazilian Arc of Deforestation, creating a\nSouthern Amazon biodiversity corridor by adjoining to other protected areas in the region.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\n14.

{"input":"Question: What is the methodology of this project?\n\nContext: \n\nVCS Project Description\nMinistry of Environment and Forests, Govt. of India has stipulated the following indicators\nfor sustainable development in the interim approval guidelines for CDM projects. The present\nproject activity meets these goals in the following manner:\na. Social well being - The proposed project activity leads to alleviation of poverty by\nestablishing direct and indirect employment benefits accruing out of ancillary units for\nmanufacturing lattice towers for erecting the WEGs and for maintenance during operation of\nthe project activity. The infrastructure in and around the project area will also improve due to\nproject activities. This includes development of road network and improvement of electricity\nquality, frequency and availability as the electricity is fed into a deficit grid.\nb. Economic well being - The project activity leads to an investment of about INR 460\nMillions to a developing region which otherwise would not have happened in the absence of\nproject activity. The generated electricity is fed into the Integrated Northern Eastern Western\nNorth Eastern grid through local grid, thereby improving the grid frequency and availability\nof electricity to the local consumers (villagers & sub-urban habitants) which will provide new\nopportunities for industries and economic activities to be setup in the area thereby resulting in\ngreater local employment, ultimately leading to overall development. The project activity also\nleads to diversification of the national energy supply, which is dominated by conventional\nfuel based generating units.\nc. Environmental well being - The project utilizes wind energy for generating electricity\nwhich otherwise would have been generated through alternate fuels (most likely - fossil fuel)\nbased power plants, contributing to reduction in specific emissions (emissions of\npollutant\/unit of energy generated) including GHG emissions. As wind power projects\nproduce no by-products in the form of solid waste (ash etc.), they address the problem of solid\nwaste disposal encountered by most other sources of power. Thus the project causes no\nnegative impact on the surrounding environment, and by utilizing a renewable energy\nresource contributing to environmental well being by reducing the use of fossil fuels.\nd. Technological well being \u2013The 1.65MW and 1.25MW wind turbines employ the\nadvanced technology for generation as well as for grid interaction. The Supervisory Control\nand Data Acquisition system (SCADA) installed for recording and transferring the data on\nline. The SCADA installed for transferring the data of wind energy generated from the\nfacilities to the nearest state Grid\u2019s.\n1.17 List of commercially sensitive information (if\napplicable):\nThere is no commercially sensitive information applicable.\n2 VCS Methodology:\n2.1 Title and reference of the VCS methodology applied to\nthe project activity and explanation of methodology\nchoices:\nType I: Renewable Energy Projects\nCategory: D : Grid connected renewable electricity generation\nAMS 1D, Version 14, EB 48\nReference: Appendix B of the simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale CDM\nproject activities i.e. \u2018indicative simplified baseline and monitoring methodologies for\n11\n\n[['Emission Factor (tCO \/GWh) \u2013\\n2\\nIncluding Imports', '2005-06', '2006-07', '2007-08', 'Average Values'], ['Simple Operating Margin\\nBuild Margin (ex ante calculation)\\nCombined Margin', '1.02', '1.01', '1.00\\n0.60', '1.01\\n0.60\\n0.906 tCO2\/MWh']]\nVCS Project Description\nselected small-scale CDM project activity categories. Tool to calculate the emission factor for\nan electricity system (Version 01.1, EB 35 Annex 12).\nExplanation of methodological choices:\nThe project category is renewable electricity generation for a grid system, which is also fed\nby both fossil fuel fired generating plants (using fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, diesel,\nnaphtha etc.) and non-fossil fuel based generating plants (such as hydro, nuclear, biomass and\nwind). Hence, the applicable baseline, AMS 1D, Version 14, EB 48, is the kWh produced by\nthe renewable generating unit multiplied by an emission coefficient (measured in\nkgCO2\/kWh) calculated in a transparent and conservative manner.\nThe methodology gives two options for calculating the baseline for a Type I D project:\n(a) A combined margin (CM), consisting of the combination of operating margin (OM) and\nbuild margin (BM) according to the procedures prescribed in the \u2018Tool to calculate the\nemission factor for an electricity system\u2019.\nOR\n(b) The weighted average emissions (in kg CO2e\/kWh) of the current generation mix. The\ndata of the year in which project generation occurs must be used.\nCalculations must be based on data from an official source (where available) and made\npublicly available.\nThe project activity evacuates approximately 14.54 Million kwh of clean electricity per year\nusing wind turbines to the (MahaTransco) MSEDCL grid, which falls under Integrated\nNorthern, Eastern, Western and North Eastern Grid in India. The Integrated Northern,\nEastern, Western and North Eastern Grid have been selected as the reference grid for\nestimation of baseline. The displaced electricity generation is the element that is likely to\naffect both the operating margin in the short run & the build margin in the long run; electricity\nbaselines should reflect a combination of these effects. Therefore an ideal baseline approach\nis envisaged as the one that combines both Operating & Build margin as prescribed in first\nalternative given in paragraph 9 under category I.D of the UNFCCC M&P for small-scale\nprojects.\nThe baseline emission factor is calculated using the combined margin approach as per Tool to\ncalculate the emission factor for an electricity system, Version 1.1. The baseline emission factor\nhas been considered from the \u201cCO2 Baseline Database for the Indian Power Sector,\nVersion 4.0, November 2008\u201d published by CEA. The emission factor published by CEA for\nthe latest year 2007-08 is used for the calculations.\nKey assumptions & rationale in Baseline Emissions:\nAMS I D Version 14, EB 48 & Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system,\nVersion 1.1 describes a stepwise approach to apply the methodology to the project activity.\nBaseline Emission factor is calculated as combined margin, consisting of a combination of\noperating margin (OM) and build margin (BM) factors. This methodology lists the parameters\nthat need to be monitored for estimating the baseline, project emissions as well as leakage.\nBaseline emission factor EFy is calculated as the weighted average of the Operating Margin\nemission factor (EFOM,y) and the Build Margin emission factor (EFBM, y):\n12\n\n[['', 'Source', 'Gas', '', 'Included\/', '', 'Justification \/ Explanation'], [None, None, None, None, 'Excluded', None, None], ['Baseline', 'Grid electricity', 'CO2', 'Included', None, None, 'Main emission source.'], [None, None, 'CH4', 'Excluded', None, None, 'Excluded for simplification.'], [None, None, 'N2O', 'Excluded', None, None, 'Excluded for simplification.'], ['Project\\nActivity', 'Electricity\\ngeneration', 'CO2', 'Excluded', None, None, 'Not applicable, since no emissions\\noccur from project operation.'], [None, None, 'CH4', 'Excluded', None, None, 'Not applicable since no emissions\\noccur from project operation.'], [None, None, 'N2O', 'Excluded', None, None, 'Not applicable since no emissions\\noccur from project operation.']]\nVCS Project Description\nEFy = wOM x EFOM, y + wBM x EFBM, y\nFor wind projects, the default weights are as follows: wOM = 0.75 and wBM = 0.25 (owing\nto their intermittent and non-dispatchable nature). Emission factor for Operating Margin and\nBuild Margin are taken from CEA guidelines. Thus baseline is the kWh produced by the\nrenewable generating unit multiplied by an emission coefficient (measured in kg CO2e\/kWh)\ncalculated.\n2.2 Justification of the choice of the methodology and\nwhy it is applicable to the project activity:\nThe project activity falls under the project category 1.D. As per the, Simplified modalities and\nprocedures for small-scale CDM project activities, Type (1) projects are defined by the\n\u201crenewable energy project activities with a maximum output capacity equivalent to up to 15\nmegawatts (or an appropriate equivalent)\u201d. While the Appendix B of Simplified modalities\nand procedures for small-scale CDM project activities, defines project category 1.D as\nprojects having renewable electricity generation for a grid:\nThe present project activity is characterised by the following:\n\u2022 Generates renewable energy (wind)\n\u2022 Installed capacity is 8.3 MW ( will not exceed 15 MW)\n\u2022 The project activity is supplying power to integrated Northern Eastern Western North\nEastern Grid respectively and many fossil fuel based power plant supply electricity to\nthe same grid.\nTherefore, the project falls under the project category of 1.D. Thus the methodology AMS\n1.D. Version 14, EB 48 is applicable to this project activity.\n2.3 Identifying GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs for the\nbaseline scenario and for the project:\n2.4 Description of how the baseline scenario is\nidentified and description of the identified baseline\nscenario:\nThe project category is renewable electricity generation for a grid system, which is also fed\nby both fossil fuel fired generating plants (using fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, diesel,\nnaphtha etc.) and non-fossil fuel based generating plants (such as hydro, nuclear, biomass and\nwind).

The field of native forest where the project is located has 22,878.5 hectares and immersed\nin the Green Corridor there is a sawmill operating. In this area, controlled logging has been carried out since\nthe 1960s and will decrease as the NIDEPORT project progresses, with harvesting expected to be\ncompleted by the end of 2021. The project activity is improved forest management with areas that will be\nenriched and regenerated by planting more than 250,000 native species individuals annually and others\nmanaged to increase forest productivity (bambuacea\u00b4s control, and others). The Forest Regeneration Plan\nstates the seedlings distribution which has been defined on the particular situation of the stratum and the\narea of the field to be treated, based on an in-depth study of different variables using various tools and in\ncollaboration with a professional team.\nAlthough there is not any community, individual or group of people living in the project area, GS1 has been\nsubjected to situations of intrusions and illegal occupations, with burning for planting or deforestation for\nrudimentary construction, there are numerous cases where the land has been colonized or exploited for\nagriculture or livestock, where the land is left with high levels of degradation and contamination. For these\nreasons project activities include enrichment and restoration. The area of the woody strata affected by\nenrichment activities (7,860 ha) will be actively intervened by the planting of an average density of 696\nseedlings per hectare (391ha), while in the remaining area the restoration will be through passive natural\nregeneration. On the other hand, in the most affected strata, the intervention will be in the total area through\nreforestation actions.\nBy conserving and sustainably managing almost 23,000ha of Atlantic Forest, the project proponent will\ncreate a cryptocurrency based on the natural capital of the forest with a primary focus on biodiversity and\na secondary focus on carbon.

HZL had devoted themselves to adopt the measures which will\nhelp in reducing the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission in our atmosphere and motivating industrial sector\nto be an acute contributor in contesting global warming while making a sustainable growth. HZL has\nregistered its first waste heat recovery (WHR) project in their Zinc roaster unit based at Chanderiya\nlocation in Rajasthan state of India under VCS mechanism.\nPP is looking forward to develop a small-scale grouped waste heat recovery (WHR) technology-based\npower generation project activity (hereafter referred as \u201cproposed project activity\u201d) at its upcoming\ngreenfield industrial units & existing Industrial units spread across the state of Rajasthan, India under\nVCS mechanism.\nThe objective of the grouped project activity is to develop a platform for reducing VCS Registration\ntimelines and process costs for registration of individual small-scale WHR based power generation\nprojects under VCS mechanism. The proposed grouped project activity will support development of WHR\nbased power generation plants to encourage efficient utilization of waste flue gases generated during the\ndifferent industrial process operations in India. Each instance of project activity under this grouped project\nwill consist of one WHR based power generation plant. The proposed grouped project is a voluntary\naction being undertaken by HZL.\nAll the project activity instances being included in the proposed grouped project are owned by HZL and\nlocated in the state of Rajasthan only. HZL is acting as Coordinating and Managing entity for the Grouped\nProject activity. The WHR based power generation plants under the grouped project activity would\ngenerate electricity, which otherwise in absence of project activity would have been generated from fossil\nfuel fired grid connected power plants and\/or fossil fuel fired captive power plant. The grouped project\nactivity thus leads to reduction in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.\nProject Scenario for the Project Instance 1:\nThe project instance involves the installation of waste heat recovery technology1-based power generation\nproject in Zinc Fuming process plant which is located at HZL Chanderiya smelting unit in Rajasthan. PP\nhas done the exhaustive research to come up with a Greenfield Zinc Fuming process plant which will\nconsume this Hazardous waste (Jarosite) to produce Non-hazardous saleable product (Slag). Eventually,\nthe final slag produced from the treatment of the zinc ferrite will be an environmentally safe slag which\ncan be used for construction material.\nThis is the \u201cfirst of its kind\u201d2, Zinc ferrite fuming process plant in India which solves the problem of Jarosite\nresidue deposition in dump yards as well as converts it into a useful by-product.\nThe capacity of Zinc fuming process plant is 160,000 TPA (Tonnes per annum) which involves operation\nof two Zinc Fuming Furnaces whose exhaust flue gas temperature is 1350\u00b0C (max).\nThe purpose of the project instance is to recover waste heat available in the furnace off flue gases\nthrough 2 X 45 TPH capacity WHRB. The heat recovered is being used in the waste heat recovery boilers\n(WHRB) for generating high pressure high temperature steam (42 Kg\/cm2 251.8\u00b0C) which is then ,\nexpanded for driving turbines for generating electricity (8.6 MW).

The\npurpose of the project instance is to recover waste heat available in the furnace off flue gases through\nWHRB. The heat recovered is being used in the waste heat recovery boilers (WHRB) for generating high\npressure high temperature steam which is then expanded for driving turbines for generating electricity\n(5.58 MW). Hence, the Project activity is utilizing waste heat recovered from flue gases for generating\nelectricity and thereby replacing electricity generated by fossil fuel fired power plants.\nPre-project scenario Instance 2:\nThe project instance is going to be installed in existing WEG facility i.e. Lead plant where waste energy\ncarrying medium i.e. furnace off gases was vented into the atmosphere as per the existing ongoing\nindustry practice & norms, so prior to the project activity there were no such waste heat recovery project\nactivity existed at Dariba plant, Rajasthan.\nBaseline Scenario:\nIn the absence of the project instance, heat available in flue gases shall not be recovered and vented off\ninto the atmosphere in compliance with the standard industrial flue gas venting norms and the amount of\nelectricity generated in the proposed WHR power plant would have been generated entirely in the existing\nfossil fuel fired captive power plant or imported from grid.

{"input":"Question: What is the methodology of this project?\n\nContext: \n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n2 APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY\n2.1 Title and Reference of Methodology\nThe project applies a small scale methodology approved under the Clean Development Mechanism, as\nfollows:\nCategory AMS-I.E.: Switch from Non-Renewable Biomass for Thermal Applications by the User \u2013 Version\n7.0, valid from 22-July-2016 onwards19. This category comprises small thermal appliances that displace\nthe use of non-renewable biomass by introducing new renewable energy end-user technologies.\n2.2 Applicability of Methodology\nThe methodology is applicable for project activities that avoid greenhouse gases emissions by using\nrenewable biomass in order to generate thermal energy.\nThis category comprises small thermal appliances that displace the use of non-renewable biomass by\nintroducing new renewable energy end-user technologies. The end-user technology in the case of this\nproject can be established as the project proponent, who utilizes the thermal energy generated by the\nnew renewable energy technology.\nThere are no similar registered small-scale CDM project activities in the region of the project activity once\nSustainable Carbon - Projetos Ambientais LTDA made a research and did not find any registered small\u2013\nscale CDM Project activity in the region. The sources of registered small-scale CDM project activity\nconsulted were the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC)20 and Brazilian\u2019s\nTechnology and Science Ministry21. Therefore, the proposed project activity is not saving the non-\nrenewable biomass accounted for by the other registered project activities.\nThe utilization of firewood from areas without any kind of management cannot be considered a renewable\nsource of biomass, since it interferes in the carbon pools and increases the carbon emissions to the\natmosphere, turning greenhouse effect even worse. Moreover, the native wood provided from areas\nwithout a reforestation management plan does not fit any of the options of UNFCCC definition of\nrenewable biomass in Annex 18, EB 23.\nAccording to historical data from the ceramic industries presented in this project activity, Bandeira\nCeramic started its operation at 1980 utilizing non-renewable native wood from areas without any kind of\nmanagement, which was the fuel utilized for several years. Capelli Ceramic operates at the same\nindustrial park of Bandeira ceramic. This way, it can be concluded that non-renewable biomass has been\nused since before 31st December, 1989. Thus, the project activity is in agreement under the methodology\napplicability requirements.\n19 This version of the methodology is available at:\n<https:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/methodologies\/DB\/9LFOR81TCT5FLI1AJYP46CQY8O2J79>.

The project is located in south of Yueyang County, Yueyang City,\nHunan Province, China, with a total acreage of 8,038.64 ha for double-cropping rice. The project\nactivity is designed to construction the cement ditch and reservoir to realize the reducing of\nmethane emissions by conducting intermittently flooded method instead of continuously\nflooded method during the cropping season in south of Yueyang County.\nIn the baseline scenario, farmers in Yueyang County use continuously flooded method in rice\npaddies with the straw on field as the organic amendment inputs, which means fields have\nstanding water throughout the rice growing season and only dry out for harvest. However, the\norganic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH ) 4\nbecause of anaerobic decomposition. In the project scenario, farmers in Yueyang County\nchanging from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation. By\ncontrolled the irrigation and drainage according to the needs of rice growth, can save water\nresources. On the other hand, multiple aeration during rice cultivation can effectively reduce\nmethane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions.\nEmission reductions of this project are generated by reducing methane emissions of\ncontinuously flooded during rice cultivation in baseline scenario. With the project activity, an\nestimated amount of GHG emission reduction 7.03 tCO e\/ha for rice is expected. Annual 2\naverage estimation of GHG emission reductions from the project activity is 56,546 tCO e\/year, 2\nthe total GHG emission reductions are 565,460 t CO e during the fixed 10 years crediting period. 2\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nSectoral Scope 14: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU), with an activity category\nof Improved Cropland Management (ICM) under Agricultural Land Management (ALM).\nProject Methodology: AMS-III.AU Methane emission reduction by adjusted water management\npractice in rice cultivation (Version 4.0).\nThe project type of this project falls into Type III Other project activities not included in Type I\nor Type II.\n1 http:\/\/www.yyx.gov.cn\/54892\/54893\/content_1927962.html\n4\n\n[['Reference to\\nVCS Standard\\n(Version 4.3)', 'Requirement', 'Justification'], ['3.1.1', 'Projects shall meet all applicable rules and\\nrequirements set out under the VCS\\nProgram, including this document.

Subei is\nlocated on the north and south sides of the western section of the Hexi Corridor of Gansu\nProvince. The project\u2019s aim is to restore the local degraded grassland ecosystem by seeding\ngrass and building fence on the degraded grassland, increase carbon sequestration and\ncontribute to local development by introducing sustainable grazing and management of\ngrassland. The project proponent is Beijing Qianyuhui Environmental Technology Co., Ltd.\nAccording to the Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) report, before the implementation of the\nproject, the grassland in the project area was facing serious degradation and even\ndesertification due to the impact of climate change and human activities.\nIn total, 326,819.90ha of degraded grassland have been managed scientifically through rest\nand rotational grazing, fence building, and grass seeding with high-quality native forage. And\nthat reduce net GHG emissions by increasing carbon stocks and\/or reducing non-CO GHG 2\nemissions.\nThere are two main restoration measures as followed in the project:\n1) Grass seeding\nGrass seeding was implemented on 18,424.3 ha of severely degraded grassland within the\nproject boundary. Suitable native grass species including Elymus dahuricus, Achnatherum\nsplendens, Elymus sibiricus Linn, Poa annua, Agropyron cristatumGaertn, Artemisia frigida\nselected for seeding based on the soil, climate conditions in the project area and the past\nexperience of grazing restoration. At the end of the seeding period the grassland was fenced\noff for improved management. Grazing was strictly prohibited in the two year after seeding to\nensure that the grassland vegetation can be rejuvenated in the short term, and grazing can be\nresumed in the second or third year according to the local livestock carrying capacity.\n2) Rest and rotational grazing\nRest and rotational grazing with fence building were implemented in 308,395.6 ha of\nmoderately degraded grassland in order to gradually restore grassland vegetation and reduce\nsoil erosion. The alignment of the fence route was determined based on the topographical plan\nof the fence site. A seasonal rest grazing system was in place in the fenced pastures, with the\nrest period running from 1 May to 31 August, and full-time keepers were arranged to inspect\nthem.
