The Project\nactivity is a REDD+ grouped project that will generate GHG emissions reductions by avoiding the\nunplanned deforestation of wetlands in the state of Campeche, while collaborating in partnership\nwith local communities to preserve the forest and secure biodiversity and social benefits.\nThe grouped project area currently encompasses 87,751 ha within Petenes and Laguna de\nT\u00e9rminos regions in Campeche. There are 32 (thirty-two) initial project activity instances (iPAIs)\ncomprising 32,599 ha eligible for blue carbon conservation, estimated to reduce approximately\n316,924 tCO e average per year. The grouped project will include more landowners as partners 2\nand areas for conservation as the project advances. The grouped project area is not covered by\nany jurisdictional REDD+ program.\nThe major deforestation drivers identified in the region are agriculture (i.a., oil palm, maize, and\nrice plantations), cattle ranching, and other unsustainable practices in e.g., tourism and fisheries;\ninfrastructure development; canal silting; storm damage; firewood harvesting; and anthropogenic\nfires, among others. The strategic blue carbon conservation activities, include i.a.:\n\u2022 Tidal canal rehabilitation and maintenance.\n\u2022 Soil rehabilitation and promotion of natural mangrove forest regeneration.\n\u2022 Mangrove deforestation and biophysical monitoring.\n\u2022 Community training and development of workshops including experiences exchange.\n\u2022 Institutional coordination for enhancing mangrove conservation activities.\nThe project proponent has been engaging with communities in ejidos (communal lands), state\nand private lands under a participatory, inclusive, and collaborative approach.

For such cases, the tool suggests using the following criteria to determine the\nexistence of significant transmission constraints:\n1. \u201cIn case of electricity systems with spot markets for electricity: there are differences in electricity\nprices (without transmission and distribution costs) of more than 5 percent between the systems\nduring 60 percent or more of the hours of the year.\u201d This criteria is not applicable as there is no\nspot electricity market in the host country.\n2. \u201cThe transmission line is operated at 90% or more of its rated capacity during 90% percent or\nmore of the hours of the year\u201d: The transmission line operator (TEIAS) or any other official source\nhas not published the capacity usage figures for the Turkish grid, hence this criterion can not be\nproved.\nAccording to the tool, where the application of these criteria does not result in a clear grid\nboundary, a regional grid definition in the case of large countries with layered dispatch systems\n(e.g. provincial \/ regional \/ national) shall be used. A provincial grid definition may indeed in many\ncases be too narrow given significant electricity trade among provinces that might be affected,\ndirectly or indirectly, by a CDM project activity. In other countries, the national (or other largest)\ngrid definition should be used by default.\nTherefore, for the case of the subject project activity \u201cthe project electricity system\u201d and \u201cthe\nconnected system\u201d are same, and the Turkish National Grid is used as the \u201cproject electricity\nsystem\u201d. It is also confirmed by TEIAS that the Turkish grid is interconnected. There isn\u2019t any\nindependent or regional grid system in any region of Turkey. The map of the Turkish Electricity\nGrid is given in the below figure (Figure 10):\nv3.0 28\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nFigure 10: The Map showing the boundaries of Turkish Electricity Grid (Source Electricity Market\nReport 2010, by Electricity Market Regulatory Authority\nhttp:\/\/www.epdk.gov.tr\/documents\/10157\/48dd12d4-74da-4dcf-9f48-86983146c0d8)\nAll the calculations details of which are given below are made for the entire Turkish Grid.\nStep 2 - Choose whether to include off-grid power plants in the project electricity system\nThe tool requires Project participants to choose between the following two options to calculate the\noperating margin and build margin emission factor:\nOption I: Only grid power plants are included in the calculation.\nOption II: Both grid power plants and off-grid power plants are included in the calculation.\nIn our case, \u201cOption I\u201d has been selected for the calculation of grid emission factor, and only grid\npower plants are included in the calculation.\nStep 3 \u2013 Select an operating margin (OM) method\nAccording to the \u201cTool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system\u201f, version 02.2.1 in\ncalculating the Operating Margin grid emission factor for a given year y (EFgrid,OM, y), project\ndevelopers have the option of selecting from four methods:\n(a) Simple OM,\n(b) Simple adjusted OM,\n(c) Dispatch Data Analysis OM, or\nv3.0 29"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_country': 'Turkey'}"}]}

The area is near mid-size cities (Portel) and is made\nup of disturbed terra-firme (non-flooded) with only small areas in v\u00e1rzea (seasonally flooded)\nforests. Although the area is far removed (80+ km north) from the Trans-Amazonian Highway\n(Rodovia Transamaz\u00f4nica, BR-230), river and sea access has facilitated extraction of most\nprecious woods, and most forest areas are heavily intervened; settlement by ribeirinhos (river-\nmargin dwellers) is also spreading westward from the Atlantic. There are also a few logging\nconcessions authorized by the Brazilian government operating in the area. Mining operations do\nnot seem to be a problem in the territories.\nMost riverside people (comunidades ribeirinhas extrativistas) subsist by a mix of fishing, hunting,\nand especially by harvesting a\u00e7a\u00ed palm fruits and by cultivating cassava from which flour is made,\nas the latter two are the main staple foods of the people in the state of Par\u00e1. Agriculture is practiced\nin small-scale slash-and-burn plots for the cassava; the a\u00e7a\u00ed palms, which thrive and naturally occur\nin seasonal floodplain areas near the river (v\u00e1rzea forest), are harvested from the wild and\nfostered\/planted near settlements and homesteads.\nThe Marajo REDD+ Project has a significant amount of forest and is home to several ecologically\nimportant flora and fauna in a strategic region of the Amazon where there is high deforestation risk\ncaused by illegal logging and expanding slash-and-burn agriculture. The project has implemented\nvia REDDA Projetos Ambientais Sociedade Unipesoal Ltda. (REDDA) a number of activities that\nseek to reduce forest degradation and deforestation in the project area. These activities include:\n\u2022 Patrolling.\nMembers of the local communities (comunidades ribeirinhas extrativistas) are being\nemployed by the project to perform regular patrol through the project area, with a focus on\nhigh-risk degradation\/deforestation areas. The patrol units cooperate with the local\nauthorities to prevent illegal encroachment in the project area. This activity deters the main\ndrivers of Avoided Unplanned Deforestation and Degradation (AUDD) such as illegal\ntimber extraction and slash-and-burn agriculture.\n\u2022 Alternative Sources of Income.\nIn order to reduce forest degradation, it is important that the riverside communities can\nreduce their dependency on unsustainable harvesting of forest resources. To achieve this,\nthe Marajo REDD+ project is already implementing and will continue to implement a\nnumber of activities that will provide the community members with alternative sources of\nincome. These activities include but are not limited to:\no Access to training and education:\nMany people within these communities have little to no access to proper schooling.\nThe project will build several schools throughout the project area, which will allow\nchildren to receive an education and increase their opportunities in the job market.\nThis as well as other training offers will also create a framework for learning about\nsustainable practices and forest conservation.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 8\n\n[[None, 'Brazilian-Amazonian oil-chemical company active in the segment'], ['of cold extraction of oils from Amazonian oilseeds.

An example of this is the creation of eco-jewellery, which in turn can\nbe sold to generate additional income. The project has facilitated workshops,\nmainly aimed at women, to increase their proficiency in these skills and in doing\nso broaden their opportunities of income generation.\no Strategic partnerships with local sustainable companies:\nIn cooperation with the local communities, the project has established partnerships\nto promote the sustainable use of non-timber forest products. These partnerships\nencourage income generation of hundreds of riverside families. Specifically, the\nfollowing two partnerships have been established up until now:\n(i) Amazon Forest People\nThe Marajo REDD+ Project has partnered with Amazon Forest People, a local\ncosmetics company. Under this partnership, oilseeds will be extracted by\nparticipating communities and sold to AFM to be used in their cosmetic products.\n(ii) Amazon Oil\nAdditionally, the Marajo REDD+ Project has established a partnership with\nAmazon segment\nof in\nthe\nBoth be\nresponsible\nsubsequently under\nthese More\nopportunities for future partnerships are being explored in cooperation with the\ncommunities.\n\u2022 Installation of biodigesters in local communities.\nTo meet the communities\u2019 thermal energy needs, mostly for the preparation of food, the\nuse of fuelwood and charcoal is still commonplace for the riverside communities. The\nextraction of fuelwood from the forest contributes to forest degradation. To mitigate this\ndriver of degradation, the project is deploying biodigesters in the riverside communities,\nallowing them to convert their organic waste into biogas. In addition to a reduction in\nfuelwood collection, this also creates a net health benefit: the combustion of fuelwood,\nespecially in enclosed spaces, can lead to a variety of respiratory and cardiovascular\ndiseases, besides combustion of (bio)gas creates much less pollution.\n\u2022 Installation of water filtration systems in local communities.\nBesides the preparation of food, fuelwood is often used to boil water, making it safe for\nconsumption. Water filtration systems have been installed in strategic places within the\nproject area. This will provide people with free access to clean water and further reduce\ndependence on fuelwood.\nThe main driver of deforestation within the project area is slash-and-burn agriculture. Subsistence-\nbased farming is expected to remain to some extent throughout the crediting period.\nBesides the activities described above, a number of activities have been implemented to improve\nthe health and well-being within the communities, such as periodical medical examinations, access\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 9\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nto dental care and other medical care as well as workshops on oral hygiene, and general hygiene\nand sanitation, especially for women.\nThe project estimates emission reductions of 266,034 tCO2e per annum and 10,641,360 tCO2e\nduring the project\u2019s lifetime for the REDD+ component.

(Version 02.2.1)\n\"Tool to calculate project or leakage CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion\" (Version 02).\n2.2 Applicability of Methodology\nThe methodology ACM0002 (Version 13.0.0) is applicable to the proposed project activity\nbecause the proposed project meets all the applicability criteria stated in the methodology:\nThe methodology is applicable under the following conditions:\n\u2022 \u201cThe project activity is the installation, capacity addition, retrofit or replacement of a\npower plant\/unit of one of the following types: hydro power plant\/unit (either with a run-\nof-river reservoir or an accumulation reservoir), wind power plant\/unit, geothermal power\nplant\/unit, solar power plant\/unit, wave power plant\/unit or tidal power plant\/unit;\n\u2022 In the case of capacity additions, retrofits or replacements (except for wind, solar, wave\nor tidal power capacity addition projects which use Option 2 on page 10 (of the ACM0002\n(version 13.0.0)). to calculate the parameter EGPJ,y): the existing plant started\ncommercial operation prior to the start of a minimum historical reference period of five\nyears, used for the calculation of baseline emissions and defined in the baseline emission\nsection, and no capacity expansion or retrofit of the plant has been undertaken between\nthe start of this minimum historical reference period and the implementation of the project\nactivity;\u201d\nThe proposed project activity fits to first condition stated above as it is the installation of a new\npower plant at a site where no renewable power plant was operated prior to the implementation of\nthe project activity (greenfield plant).\n\u201cIn case of hydro power plants:\n\u2022 One of the following conditions must apply:\nv3.0 15\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\no The project activity is implemented in an existing single or multiple reservoirs, with no\nchange in the volume of any of reservoirs; or\no The project activity is implemented in an existing single or multiple reservoirs, where\nthe volume of any of reservoirs is increased and the power density of each reservoir,\nas per the definitions given in the Project Emissions section, is greater than 4 W\/m2;\nor\no The project activity results in new single or multiple reservoirs and the power density\nof each reservoir, as per the definitions given in the Project Emissions section, is\ngreater than 4 W\/m2.\u201d\nIn case of Kepezkaya HPP, there is only a weir that rises the water level to transfer the water to\nthe water conveying system. At the maximum operation level of 501.80 m water level the total\nextend of the area that is flooded by river is 166,258.40 m2 therefore the power density is\ncalculated to be 168 W\/m2, which is much greater than 4W\/ m2.\n\u201cIn case of hydro power plants using multiple reservoirs where the power density of any of the\nreservoirs is lower than 4 W\/m2 all the following conditions must apply:\n\u2022 The power density calculated for the entire project activity using equation 5 (provided in\nthe methodology) is greater than 4 W\/m2;\n\u2022 Multiple reservoirs and hydro power plants located at the same river and where are\ndesigned together to function as an integrated project that collectively constitute the\ngeneration capacity of the combined power plant;\n\u2022 Water flow between multiple reservoirs is not used by any other hydropower unit which is\nnot a part of the project activity;\n\u2022 Total installed capacity of the power units, which are driven using water from the\nreservoirs with power density lower than 4 W\/m2, is lower than 15MW;\n\u2022 Total installed capacity of the power units, which are driven using water from reservoirs\nwith power density lower than 4 W\/m2, is less than 10% of the total installed capacity of\nthe project activity from multiple reservoirs.\u201d\nThe proposed project activity does not have multiple reservoirs so the above conditions are not\napplicable and the project activity is eligible.\n\u201cThe methodology is not applicable to the following:\n\u2022 Project activities that involve switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources at\nthe site of the project activity, since in this case the baseline may be the continued use of\nfossil fuels at the site;\n\u2022 Biomass fired power plants;\nv3.0 16\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n\u2022 A hydro power plant that results in the creation of a new single reservoir or in the\nincrease in an existing single reservoir where the power density of the power plant is less\nthan 4 W\/m2. \u201c\nThe proposed project activity does not involve switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy\nsources at the site of the project activity, is not a biomass fired plant, is not a hydro power plant\nthat results in the creation of a new single reservoir or in the increase in an existing single\nreservoir where the power density of the power plant is less than 4 W\/m2, there fore the project\nactivity is eligible to implement the ACM0002 version 13.0.0\n\u201cIn the case of retrofits, replacements, or capacity additions, this methodology is only applicable if\nthe most plausible baseline scenario, as a result of the identification of baseline scenario, is \u201cthe\ncontinuation of the current situation, i.e. to use the power generation equipment that was already\nin use prior to the implementation of the project activity and undertaking business as usual\nmaintenance\u201d.\nThe project is not a retrofit, replacement or capacity addition so the above condition is not\napplicable,\nIn addition, Kepezkaya HPP meets the applicability conditions included in \u201cTool for the\ndemonstration and assessment of additionality\u201d (Version 6.0.0) and \u201cTool to calculate the\nemission factor for an electricity system\u201d (Version 2.2.0) referred below, the following reasons\njustify the applicability of the methodological tools:\n\u2022 \u201cTool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality\u201d (Version 6.0.0) is required to\napply for demonstrating and assessing the additionality of a project activity in ACM0002\n(Version 13.0.0).\nAccording to the \u201cTool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system\u201d (Version 2.2.0),\n\u201cThis tool may be applied to estimate the OM, BM and\/or CM when calculating baseline\nemissions for a project activity that substitutes grid electricity, i.e. where a project activity supplies\nelectricity to a grid.\u201d Accordingly, Kepezkaya HPP will supply electricity to the Turkish National\nGrid, and therefore this tool can be used to estimate the OM, BM and CM of calculating baseline\nemissions.\n2.3 Project Boundary\nTable 5 exhibits the gases included in the project boundary. CO emission is included in the 2\nbaseline but the project activity does not emit any of the gases listed, in Table 5.\nThe project boundary includes net electricity generated and supplied to the Turkish national grid.\nThe internal consumption and the GHG due to the temporary use and burning of the diesel fuel\nby the auxiliary power generators.\nv3.0 17"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_methodologies': ['ACM0002']}"}]}

In the process, an equivalent quantum of electricity that\nwould have been generated by the grid in line with the grid electricity generation mix\nis displaced by the project activity. The carbon intensity of the fossil-fuel dominated\ngeneration mix of the grid is evident from the following break-up of various types of\nenergy sources constituting the grid-mix contributing electricity to the Southern Grid\nsystem.\nTable 7: Power Generation mix of southern regional grid of India\nSource : Central Electricity authority10 as on 31\/01\/2009\n*From Wind Energy Sources as on 30\/09\/200811\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n2. \u201cIf the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a\nwind\/diesel unit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small-scale CDM project activity\napplies only to the renewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel, the\ncapacity of the entire unit shall not exceed the limit of 15MW\u201d.\nThe project activity involves only wind power generation. The gross wind power\ngeneration capacity of the bundled project activity is 7.60 MW, which is less than 15\nMW, as stipulated in the applicability criterion under consideration.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n3. \u201cCombined heat and power (co-generation) systems are not eligible under\nthis category\u201d\nThe project activity involves generation of electricity only through WTGs and is not a\nco-generation system.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n4. \u201cIn the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy\ngeneration units at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added\ncapacity of the units added by the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be\nphysically distinct from the existing units.\u201d\nThe project activity does not involve the addition of renewable energy generation\nunits at an existing renewable power generation facility.\n9Refer to: The Southern Regional Electricity Grid of India is primarily constituted of fossil- fuel fired thermal power\nplants.

Greater basal cover and grass production, for example, improves the water infiltration\nrate, reduces the rate of overland water flow, increases soil moisture and water holding capacity, and\nreduces the rate of soil erosion. This directly limits the rate of soil carbon losses from the system. Changes\nto the grass species composition, including an increase in the proportion of perennial grass species,\nincreases the amount of lignin and cellulose fraction in the plant- and dung-derived carbon inputs. These\ncomplex carbon structures are more persistent in the soil as they are resistant to microbial decomposition\nand respiration losses, which results in greater permanence of the soil carbon stocks.\nMethane emissions from enteric fermentation are reduced by improving the livestock production efficiency\nand limiting the amount of energy wasted, as detailed by the IPCC (2019)31 and summarised below. Under\nthe baseline scenario, livestock are expending a significant portion of their energy intake on walking long\ndistances each day over vast areas to find sufficient forage material of sufficient quality, on digesting low-\nquality forage, and on fighting diseases with poor overall animal health (Section 3.4). These factors all\ncontribute to the production of large amounts of methane emissions per head of livestock. This is further\nexacerbated by the herd structure including a disproportionate number of old, unproductive livestock that\nproduce a greater methane emissions intensity per head and per kg of livestock product than younger,\nproductive livestock. Under the project scenario, herd health inputs and proactive health management\npractices are implemented; livestock grazing is controlled allowing for sufficient, high quality forage intake\nwithout needing to walk long distances; the herd structure is improved to be more productive and have a\nlower emissions intensity; and the total methane emissions from the system is, therefore, reduced.\nLivestock farming in South Africa can be broadly categorised as Communal Farming, and Private Sector\nFarming. While the livestock grazing management activities implemented across the two categories will be\nsimilar, the implementation approach will be tailored to the needs of the relevant stakeholders and local\ncontext.\nThe project is not located within a jurisdiction covered by a jurisdictional REDD+ program.\nFor PI1: Drakensberg Sub-Escarpment Communal Land Stewardship the specific activities adopted by a\ngiven community for a given year are negotiated and agreed upon on an annual basis with full, free, prior\nand informed consent from all relevant parties and formalized in a stewardship agreement that is\nrecognized under South African law, including the Biodiversity Act (No. 10 of 2004)32. A summary of the\ntheory of change is presented in Figure 2 that articulates the planned project incentives, farmer activities,\nproject results and outcomes33. Given the gendered nature of livestock ownership, particular attention is\nafforded to the inclusion of women in project activities, and decision-making processes. A tiered approach\nbased on grazing and fire management practices (Levels 1 to 4) with optional extensions (Green, Bronze,\nSilver and Gold Stars) has been developed to provide a framework for advancing ambition and\ncorrespondingly greater support and incentives for the activity implementation. The specific activities and\noutcomes related to implementation of the various levels and star activities will be reported on in the\nMonitoring Report at verification.\n31 IPCC (2019) Chapter 10: Emissions from Livestock and Manure Management, Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other\nLand Use. 2019 Refinement of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. https:\/\/www.ipcc-\nnggip.iges.or.jp\/public\/2019rf\/vol4.html\n32 https:\/\/www.gov.za\/documents\/national-environmental-management-biodiversity-act-0\n33 The theory of change depicted in Figure 2 is an indication of possible implementation scenarios and outcomes. The\nincentives, activities, results and outcomes are dependent on the level of implementation agreed upon between the\nproponents and farmers associations and\/or farmers. The relevant items will be reported on in the monitoring report at the\ntime of verification.\n21\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nFigure 2. Summary of project theory of change for PI1: Drakensberg Sub-Escarpment Communal\nLand Stewardship.\n22\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nThere are several partner entities involved in the implementation of this grouped project (GP). The two\nproject proponents, TASC SA and Meat Naturally Africa, are responsible for oversight and coordination of\nthe GP implementation. Supporting them are several implementation and technical partners (See\nSection 1.6). Implementation partners have an existing presence in the target landscape and are the\nprimary interface between the GP and the participating communities. The participating community\nmembers, including farmers, Ecorangers and other participating members such as the fire management\ncommittee members, receive training and ongoing technical support through a train-the-trainer approach\nfrom Meat Naturally Africa and technical partners on the H4H model, project requirements and timelines,\ntechnical background to the project activities and any other requirements that may arise. For the first\nproject instance, PI 1: Drakensberg Sub-Escarpment Communal Land Stewardship, these implementation\npartners include Lima Rural Development Foundation34, the Institute of Natural Resources NPC35,\nConservation Outcomes36, and the African Habitat Conservancy Foundation37. Technical partners, who\nhave existing domain expertise in their field, provide technical support and\/or training to the\nimplementation partners or directly to participating community members. These technical partners include\nAfrivet38, who provide animal health products, knowledge and services, and the Herding Academy at the SA\nCollege for Tourism39, who provide CATHSETA-accredited Ecoranger training on holistic herding practices\nand livestock management. Project implementation and technical partners may change over the lifetime\nof the project.\nThe design, negotiation, and adoption of the H4H model follows a participatory process with farmers and\nother community groups, such as non-farmers, women and youth, to ensure that it is tailored and adaptable\nto the specific needs of all affected parties and to the local context. The process of establishing the criteria\nand the selection of Ecoranger candidates to be trained, for example, is led by farmers to ensure that they\nare confident in the Ecoranger candidates that will be managing their resources and ultimately employed\nby their association. The role of the Ecorangers is described in more detail under Section 1.11.1. Detailed\nstakeholder engagements are facilitated by the relevant implementation partner for each target landscape\nto ensure that the perspectives of all community groups are factored into the H4H implementation, not just\nexisting farming communities. Opportunities for broader participation of non-farmers are also identified and\nadvertised, such as in the community-based wildfire management committees and ecological restoration\nteams.\n1.11.1 Activity Tiers\nThe tiers listed below are intended as a ratcheting mechanism to accommodate for initial adoption of basic\nimproved management practices, with successively increasing ambition as the benefits of collective action\nbecome evident. As described above, the levels of implementation are decided upon through a participatory\nprocess between the proponent, the implementing partners, and the farmers. The annual level of\nimplementation agreed upon is reflected in the rangeland stewardship agreement. The level of\nimplementation and additional star system, where applicable, will be reported on for each project area for\nthat monitoring period.\nLevel 1: Rotational Rest and Fire Risk Reduction\nThe primary objective of this tier is to introduce seasonal rest into the grazing system, which allows the\necosystem to recover from disturbance (grazing and fire), improve the grass forage quality, accumulate\nphytomass, and establish more robust below-ground resources that stimulate the sequestration of SOC.\nThis is intended as an accessible tier that facilitates collective action by farmers, where little cooperation\nwas evident in the baseline scenario.

The project proponent is Makit Base Junlian Cotton Industry Co., Ltd.\nThe project area is at the south-western edge of the Taklimakan Desert which is the biggest desert\nin Asia. According to the baseline survey, before the implementation of the project, there was no\nnatural or secondary forest in the project area. According to the satellite pictures taken in 2002\n(refer to Figure2-1) and official records of local government, the project area has been a desert for\nmore than a decade.\n6,697.84 ha of forest is to be planted by direct planting on desert lands in Makit County, and the\nplanted trees are all native species (Populus alba var, Haloxylon ammodendron, Xanthoceras\nsorbifolium Bunge, Elaeagnus angustifolia Linn, Lycium ruthenicum Murr). The implementation of\nthe afforestation project will generate GHG emission removals and improve the local environment,\nenhance the capabilities of local communities and residents by providing them with relevant\ntechnical skills and training, and increase local biodiversity as a result of establishing a forest of\nnative trees.\nThe project is estimated to generate GHG emission removals of 3,615,747 tCO2e in 40 years, with\nan average annual GHG emission removal of 90,393 tCO2e.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 7\n\nCCB + VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nFigure 2-1: Satellite picture of the project area taken in 2002\nSource: http:\/\/www.arceyes.com\/\nIt can be seen from the picture that the project area and its surrounding area was covered by sand."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_state_province': 'XinJiang', 'project_country': 'China'}"}]}

The\nproposal was well received by farmers and it was approved by all project participants in the very\nnext months.\nSubsequently, each Entity socialized the project in each community through participatory\nmeetings. Farmers willing to voluntarily participate in the project were registered for these\npreliminary meetings. Each farmer concerned was then visited individually in order to assess\nhis\/her land suitability, conduct a biophysical assessment of the area, determine planting\npatterns and choice of bamboo species.\nSince the project has been conceived and proposed in a participatory way, and since it is\nmanaged by each Entity in a very cooperative way, any farmer may at any time give advice or\nrecommendations, being the full owner of the project through his Project Entity.\n68\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\nIn facts, farmers shall properly use a \u201cFarmer Journal\u201d (a register of farming activities) where\nhe\/she not only annotates all farming activities carries out each week, but also collects his\/her\nsuggestions and commentaries he\/she wants to share and\/or address with Gaia and the rest of\nproject entities.\nThe stakeholder meeting took place in stages from 10 May 2017, 21 June 2019, 30 June 2019,\n02 July 2019, 04 April 2020, 21 April 2020, 30 April 2020 in different parts of the Calabria and\nLombardy region.\nThe project proposer explained the process to stakeholders and community members regarding\nthe validation and verification of the VCS programme and the on-site visit of the\nvalidation\/verification body. The project proposer requested all the collaboration of VVB\nstakeholders during the validation process.\nSummary of comments received:\nThe project is generally well accepted:\n\u2022 Farmers are proud to be part of a climate change mitigation program\n\u2022 Farmers are grateful for this help or for reforesting their lands\n\u2022 Farmers are grateful for the additional and diversified incomes they canuse for their\nchildren's retirement or education.\n\u2022 Producers have also expressed their interest in the possibility of developing carbon\nsequestration projects. The project will help them to enter this new market.\n\u2022 In general terms, since they had not ever been involved in a bamboo cultivation, Farmers\ninputs and feedbacks has become more relevant and functional once the plantations\nstarted to be operational. As an example, a farmer in Montemilone plantation (approx. 20\nha.) wrote on the Farmer Journal that it was very beneficial to use a given fertilizer (multi-\nfeed 20.20.20) to strengthen bamboo roots during early growth periods. This suggestion\nwas firstly verified by Gaia and eventually shared with and promoted to all other farmers\ninvolved in the project.\nSome doubts or requests were taken into consideration:\nA. Will a truly efficient monitoring process be implemented? (Have heard of or known about other\nprojects led by other entities that did not includeor long-term follow-up)\nB. Will farmers receive training on agroforestry and forestry grassland?\nC. Farmers have requested the planting of other species\nIn the development of the project, all these questions were taken into account:\n69\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\n\u2022 A monitoring plan has been developed and the cooperative is strongly aware that long-term\nmonitoring is crucial for the development and permanence of the project.\n\u2022 Farmers will receive training courses as detailed in the farmers' training plan.\n\u2022 The choice was made in accordance with the choice of the farmers, the availability of the\nseedlings, the availability on the market of the bamboo wood.\nQ. How farmers will fight against pests?\nA. There is no universal solution to combat the pest. But the good practices of silvicultural\nprevention that will be taught to the farmer, allow to prevent the infestation of the parcels. The\nproject coordinator or forestry engineer responsible for training farmers will continue to seek\nsolutions and inform farmers.\n70\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\n71\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\n72\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\n73\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0"},{"role":"assistant","content":"[{'organization_name': 'GAIA s.r.l.

Land which, in the baseline, is subject to land-use and management practices and receives\ninputs listed in appendices 1 and 2 to this methodology.\nThe appendix 1 doesn\u2019t apply to the project activity due to the project activity plantations don\u2019t\nfalls in cropland category.\nv3.2 26\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nThe project activity is taking place in land that doesn\u2019t fall in the land management practices and\ninputs listed in appendix 2 of the methodology.\nAs for appendix 2, grassland, the project activity is developed in tropical wet areas where\ngrasslands are degraded and no inputs are applied.\nThe \u201cTool for the identification of degraded or degrading lands for consideration in implementing\nA\/R CDM project activities\u201d Version 1 has been applied to demonstrate that the lands are\ndegraded or degrading.\nStage 1 of the tool requires the PP to screen the lands of the project to determine whether the\narea has been classified as \u201cdegraded\u201d under any verifiable local, regional, national or\ninternational land classification system or credible study produced within the last ten years.\nIn this case is used the report of SEMARNAT (Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources)\n18 report is used; it demonstrates the soil degradation of the country . The maps 3-2 (page 118), 3-\n3 (page 119) and 3-4 (122), show that the regions of the project activity falls in the category of\n19 degraded and the cause of the degradation is overgrazing .\nThe project activity also complies with the applicability conditions of the tool contained in the\nmethodology AR-ACM0003 version 1.0.0. In some cases there are tools that don\u2019t have any\napplicability conditions therefore are not described below. In general, the project activity complies\nwith all the applicability conditions of all the tools involved with the methodology AR-ACM0003\nversion 1.0.0.\nTools applicability conditions related to the project activity\n\uf0b7 The tool for \u201cEstimation of the increase in GHG emissions attributable to displacement of\npre-project agricultural activities in A\/R CDM project activity\u201d Version 01, mentions that\nthe tool is not applicable if the displacement of agricultural activities attributable to the\nproject activity is expected to cause any drainage of wetlands or peat lands. The project\nactivity does not fall in wetland region; therefore this applicable condition doesn\u2019t apply to\nthe project activity.\nThe tool for \u201cEstimation of non-CO2 GHG emissions resulting from burning of biomass\nattributable to an A\/R CDM project activity\u201d mentions the following applicability condition:\nNon-CO2 GHG emissions resulting from any occurrence of fire within the project\nboundary shall be accounted for each incidence of fire which affects an area greater than\nthe minimum threshold area reported by the host Party for the purpose of defining forest,\nprovided that the accumulated area affected by such fires in a given year is \u22655% of the\nproject area.\nIn the case of an incident occurs the previous tool will apply to the emission reductions\ncalculation.\nIn summary the project activity is in line with the applicability conditions:\n\uf0b7 The project does not fall in a wetland category (according the Land Use Research by FSI\nServicios T\u00e9cnicos Forestales y Ambientales).\n\uf0b7 The soil disturbance is less than 10% as was demonstrated.\n\uf0b7 Additionally, none of the plantations fall in the categories shown in the Table 2 of the\nmethodology.\n\uf0b7 The project activity is in line with the applicability conditions of all the tools.\n18 SEMARNAT.
