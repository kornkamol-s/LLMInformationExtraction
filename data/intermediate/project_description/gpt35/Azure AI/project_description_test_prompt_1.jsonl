{"input":"Question: What is the project summary, province, country, latitude, and longitude of this project?\n\nContext: \n\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.3\n1 PROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nMalawi is one of the least developed countries (LDC) and among the poorest nations in the world1, with\na population whose lives and livelihoods are highly dependent on rain-fed agriculture and wood fuel\nresources. Malawi\u2019s forest areas have continuously decreased over recent decades2, and its growing\npopulation coupled with the effects of a changing climate further exacerbates the country\u2019s historical\ntrend of deforestation and forest degradation. Forest loss in Malawi is a leading cause of soil degradation\nand erosion, with cascading negative effects on water and soil nutrient availability that further challenges\nsmallholder agriculture in the country3, putting much of the population\u2019s overall resilience at risk.\nIn an effort to reverse this trend, Ripple Africa and GreenCollar are implementing a grouped afforestation\nproject in the Northern and Central regions of Malawi. The first activity instance of this grouped project\ntakes place in the District of Mzimba, with the planting of 1.8 million trees in 2022 and 2023. Subsequent\nplanting across the districts will be added to the grouped project as new activity instances.\nOver 66% of Malawi\u2019s forest area is located in the Northern and Central regions of the country. Malawi is\nseverely affected by deforestation with a high average annual rate of 1.5% between 2018-2022 and a\n16% decrease in tree cover in 2001-20234. Deforestation is driven by the unsustainable and often illegal\ncollection of wood fuel and encroachment of farmland. The afforestation project will alleviate pressure\non existing forests in the Northern and Central regions of the country and integrate forest regeneration\ninto local community practices by planting trees on degraded land, fostering forest conservation, building\nlandholder capacity to manage and maintain planted forests and tree nurseries, and providing alternative\nsources of income to the people participating in the program (hereafter, Registered Beneficiaries).\nFurthermore, Ripple Africa will use a portion of the funding generated by the project through the sale of\ncarbon credits for additional activities that will benefit communities. This may include planting community\nfruit trees in farms and schools and establishing Forest Conservation Committees to strengthen native\nforest protection and regeneration in the region. Fruit tree planting and forest conservation activities will\nenhance the positive climate, environmental and socioeconomic impact of the afforestation project but\nwill not generate additional VCUs for the project.\nTo implement the project, Ripple Africa has the approval of the Department of Forestry which will support\nRipple Africa\u2019s engagement with local leaders and communities. To ensure the long-term success of the\nproject activities and the sustained growth of the planted trees, Ripple Africa will sign Tree Planting\nProgram Landholder Agreements with Registered Beneficiaries participating in the project\u2019s afforestation\nactivities. Ripple Africa has been implementing environmental, educational, and healthcare programs in\nMalawi for the last 20 years, maintaining a strong local presence, and has prior experience planting trees\nin the country.\n1 https:\/\/www.un.org\/development\/desa\/dpad\/least-developed-country-category-malawi.html\n2 Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy and Mining, Republic of Malawi (2019) Malawi REDD+ National Forest Reference\nLevel. 57 pp.\n3 Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy and Mining, Republic of Malawi (2017) The National Forest Landscape\nRestoration Strategy. 44 pp.\n4 Global Forest Watch: https:\/\/www.globalforestwatch.org\/\n4\n\n[['', 'Sectoral scope', '', '', '14, Agriculture, Forestry, Land Use (AFOLU).', ''], ['', 'AFOLU project category5', '', '', 'Afforestation, Reforestation and\/or Revegetation (ARR)', ''], ['Project activity type', 'Project activity type', None, '', 'Afforestation and Reforestation.', '']]\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.3\n1.2 Audit History\nNot applicable.\n1.3 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\n1.4 Project Eligibility\nGeneral eligibility\nThe grouped project falls within the scope of the VCS Program outlined in section 2.1 of the VCS Standard\nv.4.5 because:\n\u25cf The project will account for carbon dioxide (CO 2), one of the Kyoto Protocol GHGs.\n\u25cf The project ARR activities are supported by the methodology VM0047 Afforestation, Reforestation\nand Revegetation Version 1.0 approved under the VCS Program6.\n\u25cf The project is not located within a jurisdiction covered by a Jurisdictional REDD+ Program.\n\u25cf The project ARR activities are not included in the list of project activities excluded by the VCS\nProgram.

The project activity has been essentially conceived to generate GHG\nemission free electricity by making use of available biomass at the project site to supply the\nelectricity to the grid. The project being a renewable energy project leads to sustainable\ndevelopment through efficient utilization of available natural resources and generation of\nadditional employment for the local stakeholders.\nThe project activity is generation of electricity by utilizing surplus biomass residues like paddy\nstalks, ground nut shell, stalks of red grams, mung, til, maize etc. agro industrial waste (rice\nhusk) and woody biomass (juliflora & casuarina twigs, etc) from agricultural\/waste lands,\nwhich are available in the project region and exporting the generated electricity to the grid\nsystem owned by Orissa Power Transmission Corporation Limited (OPTCL), a state utility\nwhich is part of grid.\nAs the project activities utilize naturally available Biomass project for power generation and do\nnot use any fossil fuels, the project contributes for reduction of greenhouse gases, which\nwould have, otherwise, been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants\nand\/or by addition of new generation sources.\nObjective of the Project\nThe installations of the project activities have been carried out with a motive of generation of\nelectricity from environmentally benign source of energy. The project activity comprises of\nbiomass plant. The details of the investor along with the unique identification of the Plant have\nbeen provided in Section A.4.2.\nNature of the Project\nThe basic technology involved in the project is is generating electricity using biomass\n(agricultural residues) with a 90 TPH biomass fired boiler (BFBC) using a 23 MW turbine\nwhose capacity will be governed at 20MW.

{"input":"Question: What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?\n\nContext: \n\n1 PROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nThe project changing from continuously flooded to intermittently flooded conditions during rice\ncultivation is conducted in the north of Qujing City, Yunnan Province, China, with a total acreage\nof 12,106 ha of double-cropping rice. Without the project, there would be no ditches, pumps,\nvalves, and reservoirs to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously\nflooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was cultivated by the\ncontinuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under\nflooded conditions can emit a large amount of methane because of anaerobic decomposition,\nthe intermittently flooded method is more conducive to saving water, increasing rice yield, and\nreducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.\nThe implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir\nconstruction, pumps and valves installation, training, etc. According to the needs of rice growth,\nfarmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water\nresources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic\nconditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice\npaddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in\nthe rainy season. In this case, the methane emission can be declined by an average of 48%.\nHence, with the proposed project activity, the estimated GHG reduction from rice is 4.93\ntCO e\/ha. 2\nThe project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions by 418,012 tCO e in the first seven-year 2\nperiod, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 59,716 tCO e. The project aims to 2\nreduce GHG and mitigate climate changes, increase rice productivity resulting in higher living\nstandards for local farmers and provide more job opportunities.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThis project is categorized as sectoral scope 14 (AFOLU) under Verra as justified in Section 1.3,\nalthough the AMS-III.AU methodology applied is approved under sectoral scope 15 (Agriculture)\nof CDM.\nThe project is developed under VCS scope 14 \u201cAgriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)\u201d\nwith an activity category of Improved Cropland Management (ICM) under Agricultural Land\nManagement (ALM).\n\n[['Requirements', 'Evidence'], ['Eligible ALM activities are those that reduce net GHG\\nemissions on croplands and grasslands by increasing\\ncarbon stocks and woody biomass and\/or decreasing\\nCO , N O, and\/or CH emissions from soils.\\n2 2 4', 'This project reduces CH emissions on croplands by\\n4\\nreplacing the continuously flooded method with the\\nintermittently flooded method.

This way it is\ncontributing to a reduction in specific emissions (emissions of pollutant\/unit of energy\ngenerated), including GHG emissions.\n\u2022 As hydroelectric power projects produce no end-products in the form of solid waste (ash, etc.),\nthey don\u2019t have to cope with the problem of solid waste disposal encountered by most other\nsources of power.\n\u2022 Being a renewable energy source, hydro energy is used to generate electricity that contributes\nto resource conservation.\n\u2022 Thus, the project causes no negative impact on the surrounding environment; and in the end\ncontributes to environmental well being due to the run-off river type of project activity.\nTechnological well being:\n\u2022 The project supports high quality equipment transfer from other regions and even other\ncountries, and contributes to capacity building of the labor force through training and practical\nwork.\n\u2022 The project promotes local products developed in the region, when replacement of spare parts\nis necessary, and supports renewable technology development especially for hydroelectric\npower technology.\nIn view of the above explanation, the project participants consider the project activity as\nprofoundly contributing to sustainable development.\n1.17 List of commercially sensitive information (if applicable):\nAll information provided in this project document and relevant supporting calculation sheets can\nbe publicly published.\n2 VCS Methodology:\n2.1 Title and reference of the VCS methodology applied to the project activity and\nexplanation of methodology choices:\nThe project primarily displaces power from the Sumatra grid.

The end-user technology in the case of this project can be\nestablished as the project proponent, who utilizes the thermal energy\ngenerated by the new renewable energy technology.\nThere are no similar registered small-scale CDM project activities in the\nregion of Presidente Prudente once Social Carbon Company made a research and\ndid not find any registered small\u2013scale CDM Project activity in the region.\nThe sources of registered small-scale CDM project activity consulted were the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 14 and\nBrazilian\u2019s Technology and Science Ministry15. Therefore, the proposed project\nactivity is not saving the non-renewable biomass accounted by the other\nregistered project activities.\nThe utilization of firewood from area without any kind of management can not\nbe considered a renewable source of biomass, since it involves a decrease of\ncarbon pools and increases the carbon emissions to the atmosphere, turning\ngreen house effect even worse. Moreover, the native wood provided from areas\nwithout a reforestation management plan does not fit any of the options of\nUNFCCC definition of renewable biomass in Annex 18, EB 23.\nFurthermore, firewood has been used for many decades as fuel in Brazil16.\nAlthough, it is impossible to define a start date on which this kind of non-\nrenewable biomass began to be applied, there are many documents to prove that\nwood has been used for thermal energy generation before 1989 as requested in\nthe applied methodology.

Especially in the ceramic sector, the\nuse of firewood is visible non-renewable and unsustainable, involving\nnegative environmental impacts associated19.\nThis way, it can be concluded that non-renewable biomass has been used since\n31 December 1989.\nThe biomasses utilized in the project, sawdust and sugar cane bagasse, are\ncommon residue in the region generated.\nSawdust, wood chips, peanut shells and sugar cane bagasse are all industries\nresidues coming from large scale reforestation or agroindustrial projects, so\nit is considered renewable according to option V of methodology definition of\nrenewable biomass: \u201cThe biomass is the non-fossil fraction of an industrial\nor municipal waste\u201d.\nThe elephant grass is considered renewable according to option III, as soon\nas it fits all the assumptions below:\n\u201cThe biomass is non-woody biomass and originates from croplands and\/or\ngrasslands where:\n(a) The land area remains cropland and\/or grasslands or is reverted to\nforest; and\n(b) Sustainable management practices are undertaken on these land areas to\nensure in particular that the level of carbon stocks on these land areas does\nnot systematically decrease over time (carbon stocks may temporarily decrease\ndue to harvesting); and\n(c) Any national or regional forestry, agriculture and nature conservation\nregulations are complied with.\u201d\nMoreover, the project activity will annually generate less than 45 MWThermal.\n2.3 Identifying GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs for\nthe baseline scenario and for the project:\nAccording to the applied methodology, the project boundaries for the project\nare the physical, geographical areas of the use of biomass or the renewable\nenergy, thus, the ceramic limits.\nIn the baseline scenario, there is use of non-renewable biomass to burn\nceramic devices in the ceramic\u2019s kilns.
