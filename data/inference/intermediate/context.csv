on an ex-post basis under verification. 2020-2028 are reported as ex-ante projections. The remaining
years from 2028-2109 are reported as annualized ex-ante projections averaged over 5 year increments.

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
2 Future ex-ante projections are reported based on the prior version VCS Project Description (v1.1), which
are consistent with the long term emission reduction outcomes expected by the project. Updated inventory
and modeling techniques may result in variation on an annual ex-post basis at future verifications, but the
overall ex-ante outlook is representative of the net ER expected by the project.

private property in south eastern British Columbia just north east of the municipality of

Creston3. The Darkwoods property is bounded by Kootenay Lake on the east and various
crown and private land on the other property boundaries. There is a significant in-holding in
the center of the property that was acquired by NCC in 2018-19 but is currently not part of
the project. The boundaries are surveyed with the following legal and land description for
the parcels described in Table 1.
The project area from the prior version of the PD has been updated from GIS data from
54,792 ha previously reported to 54,870.4 ha, a change of 78.4 ha (0.14%). This is a de
minimis change. This new area matches the KML files provided as part of findings
responses from the 2013-2016 monitoring period.

generated by each project activity instance.
It is standard company practice to employ external environmental consultants to
complete the fieldwork: they are provided with Redd Forests’ standard operating
procedures and on-site training in forest inventory techniques at the start of each week
of fieldwork (as specified within the Redd Forests standard operating procedures for
fieldwork).
Project proponent responsibilities and capacity building
After the first verification, project management and monitoring events will be the
responsibility of the project proponent. The project proponent will also be responsible
for the storage of information collected in relation to monitoring events. In order to
ensure that the project proponent is able to undertaken ongoing monitoring, Redd
Forests will prepare a property transition folder. The contents are detailed in Section
3.4 and the Monitoring Plan.
The project proponents and/or their associates (family members, property managers,
etc) are encouraged to participate in the fieldwork to allow for training in locating and
measuring the field plots. A Redd Forests’ Project Manager will also spend extensive
time working through the calculation processes outlined in the GreenCollar IFM LtPF
methodology to ensure that the landowner understands the principles and stages of the
project as well as the proponent’s ongoing responsibilities.
All the tasks that must be completed to maintain the project and obtain the VCUs will
be identified in the monitoring plan. All information required to complete a monitoring
event will be provided to the landowner. Redd Forests will continue to provide project
management services for the project proponents at their request; and alternatively,
these resources will enable the landowner to either independently maintain the project
or contract the services of an alternative qualified organisation.
Credit registration
It is the responsibility of the project proponent to register credits. However, as the
implementing partner, Redd Forests has contracted to register the project, open a VCS
Registry Account in the name of each project proponent and to facilitate the issuance
of the credits arising from the first verification. This will be completed in accordance
with the VCS Guidance Document: VCS Project Registration and VCU Issuance
Process (version 1.1).
The project proponent for each instance is responsible for co-ordinating the ongoing
monitoring events and the registration of the credits in accordance with the VCS
Guidance Document.",641,641_PROJ_DESC_641_12MAY2011.pdf

project size)
Addition 1 comprises 3249.65 hectares and is calculated to reduce emissions by 26 688
tCO2-e each year of the project. Therefore, over the twenty-five year crediting period,
this project will prevent 667 206 tCO2-e being emitted.
For each additional project activity instance included within the Grouped Project, the
following information will be provided within the specific project file:
• The total size of the instance, i.e. the forested area owned by the specific
project proponent(s), generating carbon credits as part of the Redd Forests’
grouped IFM project (hectares);
• The projected emission reductions for each project instance, calculated both as
avoided emissions per annum and as a total for the project activity instance
over the specified crediting period.",641,641_PROJ_DESC_641_12MAY2011.pdf

requirements) applied to the project activity and explanation of methodology
choices
All instances in the Grouped Project will be subject to the monitoring requirements
outlined in the VCS approved “Methodology for Improved Forest Management:
Conversion of Logged to Protected Forests”. The monitoring requirements outlined in
this methodology are designed specifically to address the needs and concerns
associated with Improved Forest Management project activities. They are therefore
appropriate for this grouped project.",641,641_PROJ_DESC_641_12MAY2011.pdf
project_location,"1.5 Project location including geographic and physical information allowing the
unique identification and delineation of the specific extent of the project
The Grouped Project covers the Australian state of Tasmania (Figure No. 01).
Tasmania is an island located 240 km south of the eastern side of the continent, being
separated from the mainland by Bass Strait. The state has an area of 68,401 square km,
of which the main island covers 62,409 square km.
Tasmania is promoted as ‘The Natural State’ owing to its significant natural
environment. Formally, almost 37% of Tasmania is in reserves, national parks and
World Heritage sites. The island is 364 km long from the northernmost point to the
southernmost point and 306 km from west to east.
The specific extent of the grouped project geographical area is defined by the

crediting period,"1.6 Duration of the project activity/crediting period
The Grouped Project start date is 1 April 2010. The grouped project ceases 25 years
after this start date on 31st March 2035.
The first project activity instance (Addition 1 – Connorville) will have a crediting
period of twenty-five years. The crediting period for the other instances is a minimum
of twenty years, commencing upon the signing of a contract between Redd Forests and
the project proponent. The additional project proponents must sign the contract to
commence the project within its first five years, and will be eligible for a maximum
crediting period from this start date through to the end of the Grouped Project crediting
period (31st March 2035).
Instances within the Grouped Project will be monitored individually, approximately
upon the anniversary of their start date. These annual monitoring events will assess
natural disturbance, changes to project area and market leakage. Changes in the carbon
stock will be calculated through modelling and extrapolation. Every five years, a more
comprehensive monitoring event will be completed to assess changes in carbon stocks
through fieldwork. This is in accordance with Schedule 7.0 and consistent with the
Monitoring Plan.",641,641_PROJ_DESC_641_12MAY2011.pdf
sector,"1.2 Type/Category of the project
The project is a grouped project. This means that discrete project activity instances
(hereafter, instances) to be managed under the selected IFM methodology will be
added within the project area of Tasmania. These instances will be added at monitoring
events.
The Grouped Project is an Improved Forest Management (IFM) project, specifically
Logged to Protected Forests (LtPF).",641,641_PROJ_DESC_641_12MAY2011.pdf
