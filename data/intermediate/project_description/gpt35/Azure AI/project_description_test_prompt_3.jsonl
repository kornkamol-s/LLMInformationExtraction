The\nimplementation of grouped project activity ensures energy security, diversification of the grid\ngeneration mix and sustainable growth of the electricity generation sector in Colombia.\nAll project activity instances within this grouped project activity will consist of single solar\nrenewable technology. Also, an individual project activity instance will either be small-scale\n(having methodology AMS I.D version 18.0) or large-scale (having methodology ACM0002\nversion 19.0).\nBefore the implementation of the project activity, no power plants were installed at the project\nsite. The energy that will be generated by the grouped project is currently dispatched by other\npower plants that are connected to the national grid, and that include fossil fuel power plants.\nHence, the baseline scenario and the scenario prior to project implementation are the same and\nthe project will help to reduce thermal power generation in the National Interconnected System\n(SIN1) by providing renewable energy to the grid.\nThe first phase of the solar grouped project will have a total installed capacity of 229.45 MW, with\nthe installation of 742,289 Solar Photovoltaic units. The electricity generated by the grouped\nproject is expected to be around 447.09 GWh per year, which will be delivered to the SIN, to a\nthird party, or represents a project activity that results in savings of electricity that would have\nbeen provided by the grid; avoiding part of the electricity generated by the grid-connected power\nplants. Thus, it will contribute to sustainability by increasing the share of renewable energy and\nreducing GHG emissions.\nAll the project activity instances i.e. renewable energy generation of Solar Photovoltaic \u2013 SPV\nplants to be included in this grouped project, will be within Colombia only (see Table 1). Hence\nthe location and geographical boundary of the grouped project can be defined as Colombia. The\nestimated annual emission reductions over a 10-year period of first crediting period from initial 6\nproject activity instances are 79,870 tCO e\/year. The total emission reductions for 10 years 2\ncrediting period will be approximately 798,704 tCO e. 2\nTable 1.

In this context, and considering that hydropower use a renewable and non-polluting resource, and that does not depend on foreign issues, this project is presented as a convenient alternative to avoid the energy dependence on other countries and some of environmental problems, such as climate change.The energy generated by this project activity, will be produced from environmentally safe and sound technology of hydroelectricity generation equipment designed, engineered and manufactured by a respected supplier. Any of trusted manufacturers are then, going to transfer to the Host Party its know-how by means of training the power plant staff during the construction, commissioning and operation of the project activity.The implementation of this hydropower project will displace the dispatch of thermoelectric power plants currently operating in the system and will contribute with greenhouse gases (GHG) emission reductions, specifically by avoiding the emissions of CO2 produced by the combustion of fossil fuels, delivering clean energy to the grid that would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources. Thus, the expected annual emission reduction of the project activity is 610,724 tCO2.In addition, San Pedro Hydropower Plant diversifies the energy pool through the implementation of renewable energy sources helping to reduce Chile's dependence on natural gas coming from Argentina and other countries and to supply the progressive increase in the energy sector demand, which has grown strongly in recent years, thus contributing with the sustainable development of the country.\", 'project_state_province': 'Valdivia province in Los R\u00edos Region', 'project_country': 'Chile', 'project_latitude': -39.75, 'project_longitude': -72.58}"}

A large proportion of India\u2019s population is\ndependent on agriculture and allied activities for survival and income. When farmers own lands which\nbecome degraded due to non-cultivation, their incomes are affected as they are often mostly small and\nmarginal farmers and their lands are not productive enough. These farmers\/land owners have often only\none source of income making them vulnerable to poverty in case of crop failure. Therefore, carrying out\nafforestation\/reforestation on fallow or barren lands will increase and\/or diversify their sources of\nincome. Diversified sources of income can make local communities comparatively less vulnerable and\nmore resilient to financial stresses. The carbon credits generated from such activity will result in carbon\nincome that can protect the local communities from poverty to some extent. The project activity\ncontributes to SDG 1 of working towards the goal of \u2018No Poverty\u2019\nSDG 3 \u2013Good health and well-being\nTrees absorb carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen as part of their photosynthesis process.

For the\npast five years, JMI has been promoting a 3 500smallholders based agroforestry system in Mali by\ninvesting in and managing the establishment of sustainable Jatropha curcas plantations. The system\nconsists in planting rows of Jatropha in association with other crops.\nIn Kita circle, the total area cultivated with crops at the start of the project is 157 000 ha and JMI aims to\nplant up to 15 000 ha of Jatropha by 2017 in this area.\nArea%(ha) 200 1000 500 1000 900 1400 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000\n1.1.2 A community based approach (approved by Agence Fran\u00e7aise de\nD\u00e9veloppement)\nJatropha is a rustic oilseed bearing tree, which adapts to a wide range of tropical climatic\nconditions. Jatropha has been present for years in the ecologically-suited Sudano-Sahelian belt as live\nfencing to protect gardens and food crops from livestock. According to recent studies, the Sahel today\nwould count about 10,000 km of this type of fencing3. Its seeds contain at least 30% oil, which is used\nlocally in JMI's project as a direct source of biofuel,to produce electricity or for the soap industry.\nBiofuel is used locally where fossil fuel access is very difficult. Mali has no easy access to the sea, so\nthe demand for this kind of biofuel, which moreover is cheaper than fossil fuel, is very high. The sale of\nthese products will allow JMI to insure sustainable revenue to its farmers partners. The by-product of\nthe oil is a high quality organic fertilizer, used in the agroforestry systems. In addition, Jatropha trees\nsequestrate carbon. With an average of 1,200 trees per hectare, a plantation can sequestrate up to\naround 120 tCO2\/ha over a period of 10 years.\nsize\nEach\nfarmer chooses its plantation plot(s) on his own non-forested land. Therefore, the project's numerous\nplantation plots are located all over Kita circle. In order to strengthen its partnership with local farmers,\n3HENNING.

{"input":"Question: What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?\n\nContext: \n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\n1 PROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nThe project is to change from continuously flooded regimes to intermittently flooded regimes\nduring rice cultivation in Youyang County, Chongqing City, China, with a total acreage of 16,548\nha of single-cropping rice. A total of 8,533 households (36,351 farmers) were involved in the\nproject. Without the project, local villagers would not have access to intermittently flooded\ntechnology and intact facilities to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional\ncontinuously flooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was\ncultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Due to the anaerobic\ndecomposition of organic matter in the paddy soil under flooded conditions, a large amount of\nmethane can be released, so the intermittently flooded method is more conducive to water\nefficiency, improving rice yield and reducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded\nmethod.\nThe implementation activities of the project include promoting intermittently flooded technology,\ntechnical training for the farmers, facility repair and replacement, etc. According to the needs of\nrice growth, farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only\nsaves water resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under\nanaerobic conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to\nthe rice paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice\npaddies in the rainy season.\nThe project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions by 365,337 tCO e in the first seven-year 2\nperiod, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 52,191 tCO e. The project aims to 2\nreduce GHG and mitigate climate changes, increase rice productivity resulting in higher living\nstandards for local farmers and provide more job opportunities.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThis project is categorized as sectoral scope 14 (AFOLU) under Verra as justified in Section 1.3,\nalthough the AMS-III.AU methodology applied is approved under sectoral scope 15 (Agriculture)\nof CDM.\nThe project is developed under VCS scope 14 \u201cAgriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)\u201d\nwith an activity category of Improved Cropland Management (ICM) under Agricultural Land\nManagement (ALM).\n4\n\n[['Requirements', 'Evidence'], ['Eligible ALM activities are those that reduce net\\nGHG emissions on croplands and grasslands by\\nincreasing carbon stocks and woody biomass\\nand\/or decreasing CO , N O, and\/or CH\\n2 2 4\\nemissions from soils.', 'This project reduces CH emissions on croplands\\n4\\nby replacing the continuously flooded method with\\nthe intermittently flooded method.

According with section 2.1 of\nthe VCS Standard (V 4.7), the activities of the project are not excluded.\nAFOLU project eligibility\nAccording to the VCS Standard V 4.7, eligible REDD activities are those that reduce net GHG emissions\nby reducing deforestation and\/or degradation of forests, which is the case of the KA'A PYAHU REDD+\nproject. Deforestation is the direct, human-induced conversion of forestland to non-forest land.\nThe analysis of land use categories in the project is based mainly on Mapbiomas2 which utilizes a satellite\nimagery dataset used composed by Landsat 5 (Thematic Mapper), Landsat 7 (Enhanced Thematic\nMapper Plus) and Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager), Landsast sensors. The MapBiomas classification\nscheme is a hierarchical system with a combination of LULC classes compatible with the Food and\nAgriculture Organization (FAO) and IBGE classification systems (Souza, et al., 2020). In this regard, the\nproject meets the internationally accepted definition of forest, and was qualified as forest for a minimum\nof 10 years before the project start date. The definition of forest may include mature forests, secondary\nforests, and degraded forests.\nAccording with the VCS standard, activities covered under the REDD project category are those that are\ndesigned to stop planned (designated and sanctioned) deforestation or unplanned (unsanctioned)\ndeforestation and\/or degradation. In this context, as described in section 1.9, the actions carried out in\nthe KA'A PYAHU REDD+ project, with the creation of the association, are oriented towards the defense,\npreservation and conservation of the environment. Specifically, by taking action to combat the\nenvironmental and social impacts caused by the construction of the power line.

Decision to invest in a high pressure cogeneration system has been taken considering revenues\nthrough sale of carbon credits under the clean development mechanism (CDM). Technology used in the\nproposed activity is highly replicable as the country\u2019s sugar mills produce large quantities of bagasse that\ncould be efficiently utilized to generate power.\nProject\u2019s contribution to sustainable development\nThe project activity contributes towards local, national and global sustainable development. It supports\nIndia\u2019s national policy to rely on clean power. The government\u2019s clean power diversification strategy focus\non reducing wastage of energy combined with the optimum use of renewable energy (RE) sources.\nThe project activity substitutes, and hence decreases the dependence on primarily coal-based power\ngeneration by the grid, thereby reducing carbon dioxide (CO )emissions. Coal which is a carbon intensive 2\nfuel, and emits large quantity of GHGs is being used to meet around 70% of the country\u2019s electricity\ndemand in 2005. Diversification and energy self-reliance by the sugarcane industry results in GHG\nemission reduction. The project activity positively contributes towards the reduction in demand for carbon\nintensive energy resources, efficient waste disposal and resource conservation.\nThe project activity has contributed to jobs creation in local rural area where cane growers (local farmers)\nface highly cyclical income flows. It has created higher value jobs at the cogeneration facility. The inflow\nof carbon credits from the Project\u2019s net emission reductions would create a replicable model for the\ncountry\u2019s sugarcane industry, hence contributing towards sustainable development.\nA.3.

The aim is to plant 2 million of\ntrees over a period of 6 years for a total of 1 150 000 tons of additional CO equivalent captured on 2\n40 years.\nMost of all, the Alto Huayabamba Project adds to sustainable development, offering social,\nenvironmental and economic benefits.\n- It helps people reforest and therefore bring an added value to their lands and ensure them a long-\nterm income that can be used to pay for the studies of their children or for their retirement pension.\nAs a consequence, it will provoke a local socio-economic development.\n- It fights deforestation and its consequences, such as soil erosion, decrease of water availability,\nnatural disasters, landscapes degradation, and decrease of biodiversity. It also increases farmers\u2019\nawareness about these primordial issues.\n- It promotes agro-forestry, an agricultural system which enables access to environmental services\nrecognized by the Peruvian law: conservation of water resources, preservation of biodiversity,\nconservation of landscapes, protection against natural disasters (Forestry Law N\u00b0 27308, year 2000),\nand fire risks control. Agro-forestry systems keeps on being the best strategy of management and\nprotection against the global climate change effects.\n- Last but not least, it will create carbon credits, and therefore contribute to the climate change\nmitigation through economic implication of large organizations.\nThe project is developed as a long-term project, with a project longevity of 80 years (maintenance of\nmanagement practices over 80 years)\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\n- Sectoral scope : AFOLU\n- AFOLU project category : ARR\n- Activities (CDM classification):\no Grassland to forested land\no Cropland to forested land\nThe project is not a grouped project.\n2 MEZA A., SABOGAL C., DE JONG W., 2006. \u201cRehabilitaci\u00f3n de \u00e1reas degradadas en la Amazonia peruana.
