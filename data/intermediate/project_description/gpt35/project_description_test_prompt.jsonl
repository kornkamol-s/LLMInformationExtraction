Identification of alternative land use scenarios\na. Continuation of the pre-project land use as private wildlife sanctuary:\nPrior to the implementation of the REDD project on Rukinga, the Project proponents had\nspent a significant and unsustainable amount of money over the last ten years financing\nactivities to attempt to protect the forest from destruction. Those activities provided no\nsignificant sources of income from the land to offset the land protection costs, and\ntherefore this project would eventually have failed financially if carbon funding were not\nmade available.\nb. Uses a in the ten years prior to Project start date:\nCattle Ranching - When the current majority landowners acquired their interest in\nRukinga Sanctuary in 2000, the previous owners were operating a financially\nunsuccessful cattle ranching operation on the land. The area is too dry with no\npermanent water for successful cattle ranching, and there was predation by lions on the\ncattle at a rate that lead to the financial failure of the operation, and eventual sale of the\nland to the majority shareholder of Wildlife Works.\nEcotourism - The prior owners also had an ecotourism facility on the Project area, but as\nevidence that these activities were not financially viable on the land, the slash and burn\nclearing had reached within 200 meters of the ecotourism facility, causing it to fail and\nmove away.\nc. Slash and Burn Agriculture by subsistence farmers:\nPrior to the Project Proponent taking over management of the land in 2005, local people\nhad begun to clear part of the Project area, and have systematically cleared the dryland\nforest from a majority of the Reference area in order to provide land for annual crops.\nThis is evidently the most likely Baseline scenario, as it had been carried out routinely\nthroughout the Reference region, in clear violation of land laws.\n2. Consistency of credible land uses with enforced mandatory laws and regulations:\nAll of the alternative land use scenarios above represent legal land uses, with the exception of\nslash and burn agriculture, which essentially consists of squatting on privately owned land; illegal\nunder Kenyan law. However, there is overwhelming evidence that this law had been\nsystematically unenforced, as greater than 30% of the area of the administrative unit that\nencompasses the project area had been deforested in the ten years prior to the Project start date.\nThus, all the land uses above are credible.\n3. Investment Analysis \u2013 Simple Cost Analysis:\nPhysical protection of the Project area, and provision of deforestation mitigation activities, such as\nschool building, scholarships, ranger patrols, reforestation of deforested indigenous forests etc.\nfor the community cost the Project Proponent approximately $300-400,000 per year in the years\n\u00a9 Wildlife Works Carbon, LLC 2010 50\n\nKasigau Corridor REDD Project Phase I \u2013 VCS PD Requirements\nprior to implementation of the VCS AFOLU project. There exists no significant income to offset\nthese costs. In the absence of active protection, both physical and that created by partnering with\nthe communities to create economic alternatives, it is clear the land in the Project area would be\ncleared aggressively for subsistence agriculture, as that was in fact what was already happening\nprior to our arrival. Slash and burn agriculture faces no economic barriers, and is therefore once\nagain the most likely Baseline scenario.\n4. Common Practice Analysis\nIt is common practice to protect wilderness in Africa, and to provide sustainable development\nsupport for rural African communities, but that common practice is typically funded by\ngovernments or donor agencies, and not by financial return from the project activities. It is NOT\ncommon practice for private companies that are not donor funded, such as the Project proponent\nto protect forested wilderness in Africa for financial return, in the absence of AFOLU revenues.\nThe Project proponent\u2019s Rukinga Sanctuary project is the first AFOLU Project Activity of its type\nin Kenya, and one of the very first in Africa.\nSummary of Additionality Test\nIn summary;\n\uf0b7 the Kasigau Corridor REDD project is not the only credible alternative land use consistent with\nenforced mandatory applicable laws,\n\uf0b7 one of those alternative land uses, that of Slash and Burn Agriculture is by far the most likely\nbaseline land use,\n\uf0b7 the Kasigau Corridor project passes the Investment Analysis Test as it is not a financially viable\nland use without the AFOLU VCS project revenues\n\uf0b7 and the project activities are NOT common practice.\ntherefore it is additional under the rules of VT0001 Tool for the Demonstration of Additionality in VCS\nAFOLU Project Activities.\n\u00a9 Wildlife Works Carbon, LLC 2010 51\n\n[['', '', '', '', '2005', '', '', '2006', '', '', '2007', '', '', '2008', '', '', '2009', '', '', '2010', ''], ['Linear Model (%) 3.16% 6.33% 9.49% 12.66% 15.82% 18.99%', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['AGLT 50,776 50,776 50,776 50,776 50,776 50,776', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['BGLT 20,310 20,310 20,310 20,310 20,310 20,310', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['AGST 0 0 0 0 0 0', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['BGST 0 0 0 0 0 0', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['AGNT 8,556 8,556 8,556 8,556 8,556 8,556', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['BGNT 3,422 3,422 3,422 3,422 3,422 3,422', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['SDW 0 0 0 0 0 0', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['LDW 0 0 0 0 0 0', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['WP 0 0 0 0 0 0', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['SOIL 119,709 155,515 166,225 169,429 170,387 170,674', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['Total Emissions 202,774 238,580 249,290 252,494 253,452 253,739', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]]\nKasigau Corridor REDD Project Phase I \u2013 VCS PD Requirements\nSection 8 Baseline Emissions\nBaseline emissions are calculated as the carbon pools measured in the project area, which are applied to\nthe cumulative deforestation model (determined by sampling historical imagery).

The Project will secure\n78,425 ha of forest from risk of conversion to an industrial forestry plantation. The Project is on the\nisland of Sumatra and in the Province of Riau. Specifically, it is located on the Kampar Peninsula,\nwhich is a rain-fed domed peatland forest made up of four former logging concessions.\nFigure 1- Landscape of project area (Copyright: C. Delacy \u00a9)\nThe Kampar Peninsula (674,200 ha) was first subjected to commercial timber exploitation in the\n1970s through the early 2000s. This phase was followd by a significant part of the peninsula being\ndesignated for industrial plantations, primarily Acacia crassicarpa, and to a much lesser extent, oil\npalm plantations. The remaining natural forest block (344,000 ha) on the Kampar Peninsula is the\nlargest peatland forest block in Sumatra with a peat depth that ranges from 3 \u2013 15 meters thick. As\nof 2014, when the RER area was completing its licensing, 294,227 ha or 43.6% of the peninsula\nhad been converted to Acacia forestry plantations. Today, approximately 344,000 ha of natural\nforest remains on the Kampar Peninsula, and the RER-CP is located at the centre of this.\nThe Project at its heart is tasked with demonstrating how peat landscapes can be responsibly\nmanaged to protect biodiversity and enhance local communities. Forest protection preservation is\naugmented by the ring of Acacia plantations that surrounds the Project and which acts as a natural\nbuffer to the Project Area.\nPage 17 of 404\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\nThe four original concessions that make up the Project area are PT. Gemilang Cipta Nusantara\n(20,123 ha), PT. The Best One Unitimber (40,666 ha), PT. Sinar Mutiara Nusantra (32,776 ha) and\nPT. Global Alam Nusantara (36,525 ha). All have long been gazetted as part of the Forest\nProduction Estate (Hutan Produksi) by the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry.\nThrough the acquisition of individual Ecosystem Restoration licenses (IUPHHK-RE) for each, they\nhave been saved from the risk of conversion to industrial plantations.\nWith more than 17,000 people living just outside the RER concession areas, it is essential that the\nProject provides training and incentivises improved livelihood opportunities. The biodiversity of the\nKampar Peninsula has been recognised by Birdlife International, The International Union for\nConservation of Nature (IUCN), the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and World Wildlife Fund\n(WWF) as an \u201cImportant Bird Area\u201d (2004), a \u201cKey Biodiversity Area\u201d (2006), and a \u201cTiger\nConservation Area\u201c (2007). Globally threatened species such as the Sumatran Tiger, Sunda\nPangolin, Storm\u2019s Stork, Flat-head Cat, and Malaysian Sun Bear are known to exist in the Project\nArea.\nThe carbon financing received from the Project's activities will be reinvested into the landscape and\nlocal communities to support environmental restoration, fire monitoring, scientific peatland and\nwetlands research, and preservation and conservation efforts to maintain and increase the\nincredible flora and fauna of the Project Area. There are no ongoing incidents of significant\ndeforestation or forest degradation in the project area and unplanned deforestation and unplanned\ndegradation area excluded from both the baseline and the project scenarios.\nUnder the hypothetical business-as-usual plantation baseline, the landscape would have been\nconverted to Acacia plantations.\nThrough the assistance of carbon financing, the Project, over its initial lifespan of 57 years will avoid\n373,116,864 tonnes of CO2e, (i.e. 6,545,910 tonnes of Co e per annum) from being emitted. At the 2\nsame time, the Project will ensure the delicate domed peat landscape remains intact, is not\nconverted to industrial plantations and undergoes rehabilitation (both natural and human-assisted).\nThe landscape will be rehabilitated further by blocking the legacy drainage canals from past\ncommercial selective so that the landscape is rewetted. The Project will ensure carbon remains\nlocked in the environment and that the biodiversity conservation of this unique lowland domed peat\nswamp forest of Riau can be preserved for generations to come."}]}

Having said this, the soil types of the project cannot be\ncategorized as (i) organic or (ii) grassland in which soil disturbance is restricted. According to 2006\nIPCC Guidelines (Annex 3A.5, Chapter 3, Volume 4), organic soils must have at least 12 percent organic\ncarbon by weight (i.e., about 20 percent organic matter). As it is described by Silva30 organic matter\ncontent in brunosoles soils (from Coneat 2) range from 3.1 to 8.2%. In this soil type the organic matter\ncontent, and hence the organic carbon, does not reach the 20% of the organic soils. Given that, as\nabove stated BDU project soils are classified as Coneat 2, it is concluded that the soil types of the\nproject are not organic.\nBDU II project lands are characterized by grazing activity with regular usage capacity and without\ntechnological improvements, implanted pastures or crops. These natural grasslands do not receive\nintensive management with added agricultural inputs such as fertilization, reseeding, etc. The soils are\nof reduced natural fertility and current erosion is relatively low. Hence, the Project is applicable to this\nmethodology.\nA project activity applying this methodology shall also comply with the applicability conditions of the\ntools contained within the methodology and applied by the project activity.\nCDM project standard\nThis standard establishes a set of specific requirements for afforestation and reforestation project\nactivities, among which stands out the eligibility of the land.\nIn order to demonstrate the land eligibility, the PP should follow the \u201cProcedures to Demonstrate the\nEligibility of Lands for Afforestation and Reforestation CDM Project Activities\u201d in which Project\nparticipants shall provide evidence that the land within the planned project boundary does not contain\nforest and that the activity is a reforestation or afforestation project activity\nThe land eligibility is demonstrated though the use of satellite imagery showing that vegetation on the\nland has been below the forest threshold according to the definition of forest adopted by Uruguay. In\nthis regard, the table below provides the details of the adopted definition31:\nThe satellite images displayed below show that the land did not contain forest on 31 December 1989\nnor at the moment the project started in May 2012. As it can be seen the images obtained correspond\n30 LA MATERIA ORGANICA DEL SUELO, Ing. Agr.

The land was\ncovered by natural pastures and some scattered trees planted for cattle shade not qualifying as forest.\n29\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\n30\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\nRegarding VCS eligibility requirements (AFOLU requirements, version 3.4, section 3.1.6), grassland\nvegetation dominating before project start is not the native ecosystem of the land within project\nboundaries. The native condition was modified by the introduction of beef cattle and sheep in the 17th\nand 19th centuries, respectively, and by the introduction of exotic species during the last three\ncenturies.\nAdditionality Tool\nThe \u201cCombined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality in A\/R CDM project\nactivities\u201d is applicable under the following conditions:\n31\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\n- Forestation of the land within the proposed project boundary performed with or without being\nregistered as the A\/R CDM project activity shall not lead to violation of any applicable law even if the\nlaw is not enforced.\n- This tool is not applicable to small - scale afforestation and reforestation project activities.\nThese conditions are met by the proposed project activity. The project has received all required\napprovals from the necessary local authorities to start the implementation and the project is\nconsidered a large-scale afforestation.\nCarbon stock of trees, shrubs, dead wood and litter\nTools \u201cEstimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in A\/R CDM project\nactivities\u201d and \u201cEstimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks in dead wood and litter in A\/R\nCDM project activities\u201d do not establish applicability conditions.\nSoil Organic Carbon Stock\nThe \u201cTool for estimation of change in soil organic carbon stocks due to the implementation of A\/R CDM\nproject activities\u201d is applicable when the baseline scenario and the project activity areas of land do not\nfall into wetland category; contain organic soils are not grassland in which soil disturbance is\nrestricted. Also, when the proposed project activity meets the following conditions: Litter remains on\nsite and is not removed and soil disturbance, if any, is in accordance with appropriate soil conservation\npractices.\nBoth the land features and the conservation practices applicability requirements are met by the project\nmaking this tool applicable to it. The case of the land was previously discussed in this section.\nIn relation to the conservation practices (litter removal and soil disturbance) the project has obtained\nthe FSC certification in March 2016 implying that these conditions will are accomplished32. It is\nimportant to mention that the land will be disturbed only once in the project lifetime in both cases. E.\ngrandis has only one rotation (18 years) and dunnii has two (9 years\/each) but the second one will be\nmanaged through a coppicing scheme without soil disturbances.\nEmissions from Biomass Burning\nThe tool \u201cEstimation of non-CO2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from burning of biomass\nattributable to an A\/R CDM project activity\u201d is applicable to all occurrence of fire within the project\nboundary and it mandates to calculate Non-CO2 GHG emissions provided that the accumulated area\naffected by such fires in a given year is \u22655% of the project area.\nAs above mentioned, it is not applicable to the present project activity since biomass burning practices\nwill not be part of it.\nDisplacement of Agricultural Activities\nThe tool \u201cEstimation of the increase in GHG emissions attributable to displacement of pre-project\nagricultural activities in A\/R CDM project activity\u201d. is applicable to the present project activity since the\n32 FSC certificate available for the VVB at validation.\n32\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\ndisplacement of agricultural activities is not expected to cause, directly or indirectly, any drainage of\nwetlands or peat lands, as requested in the applicability condition of the tool.\nIn conclusion, the project activity complies with all applicability conditions of the selected methodology."}]}

The partners of the project are located in 12 departments and 37\nprovinces of Peru, as shown in the following table:\nTable 05. Geographic Location\nThe grouped project is made on a single geographic area for the inclusion of new instances as\ndefined by the VCS criteria. Indeed, the initial conditions that can influence the baseline scenario\nand additionality (land use, socioeconomic conditions biophysical and ecological) are sufficiently\nhomogeneous throughout the scope of the project to justify this grouping. Small Peruvian\nproducers of coffee and cocoa, with whom we work, form a very homogeneous group with\nrespect to the management of their lands and plantations and their socioeconomic conditions.\nPopular and current agricultural practices (such as \"slash and burn, Migratory agriculture, low\ndensity and diversity in the use of shadow when used, etc.) are common to all. We use the same\nunique geographic area for the non-permanence risk assessment.\nv3.2 28\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nThe geographic area within which new project activity instances may be developed is delimited by\nthe sphere of influence of the participating cooperatives:\nEach cooperative has its producer members and performs these activities in a zone of influence.\nEach of these geographic zones forms a unit for an implementing partner. In addition, producers\nwho are not related to a cooperative of the project but are located within the area of influence of a\ncooperative may choose to become member and join the project. The following maps show areas\nof cooperatives or central that are part of the SHADE COFFEE AND CACAO REFORESTATION\nPROJECT. In some cases these territories may overlap.

The use of glyphosate will be avoided.\nDelineation: due to the topography of the area, the delineation is done by using the \"three\nbobbin\" technique in order to protect the soil from erosion\nPlating and whole making: The hole is made with a hoe, with a minimum diameter of 80 cm.\nInternal Transport: The seedlings are transported in crates and mules from the closest road to\nthe Reserve to avoid damages\nFertilizing: It is done manually at the time of planting, using 50 gr of organic fertilizer per tree (In\nthe Annex 3 PDD can be found the Summary of the fertilization)\nApplication of moisture retainer: For each tree, 2 grams of the moisture retainer SAP-POLYMER\nare applied. Application of moisture retainer: For each tree, 2 grams of the moisture retainer\nSAP-POLYMER are applied.\nPrevention and Phytosanitary Control: pest control is permanently conducted during planting\nand maintenance, especially against termites and ants with appropriate products (fungicides\nand insecticides of organic and biological origin).\nTransport of plant materials and supplies\nFor the transportation of plants, the project uses a truck in which a second level is installed to\navoid damage to plants. Seedlings are carried into crates for extra protection.\nThe discharge is done in the vereda Puente Pelaez, because the poor conditions of the roads\nprevent the access of the truck in other areas. Discharges are being executed by experienced\nstaff able to undertake the proper actions to avoid harming the trees.\nDue to the conditions of the access roads leading to the Reserve, seedlings were transported at\nthe end of the track by using horses and mules, without suffering damage.\nManagement of the sowings\nPruning: No pruning activities will take place given that the sowings are for the restoration of\nnatural forest\nMaintenance: maintenance to the reforestation will be done after the sowings and it will continue\nduring three consecutive years. Maintenance consist of:\n- Cleaning\n- Plateado\n- Sowings\n- Fertilization\nAfter the three years of maintenance, monitoring and enrichment activities will take place inside\nthe reforested area.\nLogging plan"}]}

The Plan Ladera\nproject is a referent for forest projects for the rural communities of the municipality of Medellin, on which\nwere established P. patula plantations and Eucalyptus. In general, the perception of this project has not\nbeen favorable, especially in the townships of San Sebastian and San Cristobal because of the poor\nmaintenance, technical support and contracts non-compliance. In Altavista, however, this project has a\nwide acceptation and has contributed to minimize the pressure on the access to lands for illegal housing,\nthe plantations have been like a barrier for the urban expansion, leading to conservation of micro-\nwatersheds and improving the landscape component.\n2 APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY"}]}

All the conditions for the\nproject baseline were in place before the arrival of the project developer, Wildlife Works, and in fact\neven the project area itself was beginning to be cleared before project implementation. There is little\nneed for speculation as to what would occur in the absence of the project if it ceased protection and\nthe provision of alternative livelihoods for the community. The mosaic pattern of deforestation would\ncontinue where it left off, but most likely accelerated by a much larger population base than was\npresent upon our arrival.\nThe project area had previously been used for grazing of cattle and in some cases ecotourism. Both\nactivities have systematically failed, as cattle ranching is very difficult due to a fragile ecosystem and\nlack of water. Most of the cattle grazing on the Phase II lands, prior to project implementation, was\nbeing conducted out of desperation, as it was literally the only service the ecosystem could provide.\nAforestation of plantation species and agricultural activities cannot profitably be carried out in this\necosystem, due to a lack of water and a fragile ecosystem. The forest in the project area has never\nbeen, and never will be commercially viable. We therefore believe that through the land owners\u2019\nattempts at different economic activities that there are no credible alternative economic uses for this\nland that could compete with the project financially, or provide financial sustainability that would\nprotect it from slash and burn use by the community. All 13 ranch directors corroborate this believe,\nand in fact will provide a clear explanation of their trials and tribulations in the project area to the\nvalidators upon the site visit in Kenya."}]}

The project will implement activities to conserve\nand restore the peat and mangrove forests in the project area while delivering positive impact on the\ncommunity and biodiversity. Among others, the project will implement forest patrols, fire prevention, and\nbiodiversity monitoring activities to prevent forest loss and protect biodiversity. Peat ecosystems will be\nrestored by blocking canals and rewetting the area to avoid further peat drainage. Approximately 15,088\nha of degraded land will be restored through reforestation and Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR).\nThe eastern part of the project is a peatland forest area located in Katingan Regency, Katingan Kuala Sub-\ndistrict, adjacent to the Sebangau National Park. The western part of the concession is located in East\nKotawaringin Regency, Pulau Hanaut Sub-district, and mostly consists of mangrove forests (Map 2-1).\nBased on the conducted biodiversity assessment, the concession provides important habitat for 31\nthreatened species, including the Bornean orangutan, the Proboscis monkey, and the Bornean white-\nbearded gibbon. The area is also important for at least 17 migratory bird species from three families.\nThe project will provide tangible benefits to local communities living in the surrounding area by working to\nimprove local livelihoods, health, education, and well-being. For example, the project will assist local coffee\nfarmers and honey producers to improve harvesting, processing, and market access. The project will\nsupport the establishment of women\u2019s groups in the target villages to promote economic opportunities for\nwomen; and implement interventions that improve health and sanitation in the 13 target villages.\nPrior to PT PUM receiving its principal PBPH license in 2022, the project area was planned to be developed\nas an oil palm plantation along with two other companies adjacent to the area. All three companies were\nowned by a company group named PT Agro Inti Semesta (PT AIS). Additionally, in 2022, an approval to\nconvert forest land into oil palm plantation was given to another oil palm company located along the western\nboundary of PT PUM. Without the PLUM Project, it is highly likely that PT PUM\u2019s area would have been\ndeveloped into an oil palm plantation by PT AIS.\nThe project will generate GHG emission reductions or removals by implementing activities covered by the\nVM0007 REDD+ Methodology Framework including (1) Avoiding Planned Deforestation (APD), (2)\nAfforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR), (3) Restoration of Wetlands Ecosystems (RWE) on\nPeatland and Tidal Wetlands, and (4) Avoiding Planned Wetland Degradation (APWD) on Peatland and\nTidal Wetlands. It is estimated that the project will generate a total net Verified Carbon Unit (VCU) volume\nof 69,999,940 tCO e over 60 years of crediting period or 1,166,666 tCO e per annum (Table 3-44). 2 2\nThe project\u2019s goal is to conserve the remaining forest, restore ecosystem function, protect biodiversity, and\nimprove the well-being of communities to become resilient to climate change. In conclusion, it is expected\nthat the PLUM Project will contribute to preserving the integrity of the Peat Swamp and Mangrove Forest\nlandscape and biodiversity in the area while improving the well-being of local communities.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 16\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3"}]}

If required by the host Party, documentation on the analysis of the environmental impacts\nof the project activity:\n>>\nThe EIA report of the Project was completed by Heilongjiang Farming Investigation & Design Institute,\nand approved by the Environment Protection Bureau of Kunming (Document No.: Kun Huan Bao Fu\n[2005]132). Based on the EIA report, the environmental impacts possibly caused by the Project and\ncorresponding measures adopted by the project owner are analyzed as follows:\nLand use\nAdopting a combined usage of channels and tunnels, the Project does not involve migration of local\nresidents and great amount of land occupation. The project will permanently take up 29 Mu of land and\ntemporarily 79 Mu of land, both of which are composed primarily of paddy field and dry land. The\nproject owner will make compensations according to the Land Administration Law of the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China, the Land Administration Regulation of Yunnan Province and relevant regulations to\nthe residents affected. By opening up wasteland in the village and the community, same area of land\noccupied will be developed and made up.\nAir pollution and noise\nNoise from various construction machines and exhaust gas emitted from vehicles as well as dust during\nthe construction of the Project will have temporary impacts on part of the air environment and acoustical\nenvironment of the construction area. The project owner will take measures to reduce the above impacts\non the workers, including installing dust prevention system for dust-generating facilities, sprinkling water\nat irregular intervals, reinforcing maintenance of machinery and providing reasonable protection\nmeasures. All of these impacts are temporary and are reduced with above measures.\nWaste water\nMajor pollutants of production waste water during construction and operation of the Project are\nsuspending particles, which are innoxious. It will be discharged after removing the suspending particles\nby means of sedimentation tank. Residential waste water, after lagoon treatment, will be used as fertilizer\nand not discharged directly into the river.\nSolid waste\nWaste solid and residential garbage will be generated during the construction and operation of the\nProject. The former will be dumped in the 6 designated spoil areas, while the latter will be dumped in\nfixed garbage stations and regularly cleared by specific people.\nEcological impact\nStatus quo will be maintained of the river course and basically no inundation will occur after the\ncompletion of the Project, therefore, there will be no impacts on the ecological environment.\nIn summary, negative impacts on the environment caused by the Project mainly occur in the construction\nperiod which will be eliminated with the completion of the Project. Accompanied by the implementation\nof a series of environment protection measures during the construction, the Project will not have\nsignificant impacts on the environment.\n\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-PDD) - Version 03\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board page 28"}]}

REDD has at times been conceived narrowly as\nsimply a system of conditional performance-based payments (PES), (Sills et al. (2009), The\nevolving landscape of REDD projects). Projects developed by WeAct are similarly premised on\nperformance-based payments, but we have gone further in developing an approach to project\nimplementation that recognizes the part that can be played by tried and tested interventions. These\ninclude participatory land use mapping, boundary determination, development of land use plans,\nclarification of tenure, income generating activities, employment and community development.\nThe project is estimated to generate approximately 1.98 million VCUs over 30 years. The project\narea is located in the municipality of Acand\u00ed on the northwestern coast of the Gulf of Urab\u00e1 in the\nColombian department of Choco. Belonging to the biologically diverse Choc\u00f3-Dari\u00e9n bioregion,\nforests in the project area are important nationally and internationally for the ecosystem and\nbiodiversity services they provide. Forests in the project area, however, have experienced a\ncontinued reduction in biomass due largely to illegal logging and to the establishment of crops, use\nof firewood, pastures, and settlements. These forests have historically been an important source\nof income for local families, who periodically harvest timber when the economic needs arise, or to\ngenerate income generation sources.\nChanges to Colombian Constitutional Law in 1991 resulted in the recognition of the ancestral\npresence and possession of lands by communities of African descent holding ethnic traditions and\ncultural identity. Subsequent legislation, through Law 70 of 1991, as detailed in Section 1.3.5,\ngranted land title and administrative autonomy to these communities. Law 70 also gave these\ncommunities the rights of ownership of forests, and the rights of use of other natural resources\npresent in their territories, though subject to the general legal dispositions of Colombia.\nAgriculture, cattle ranching, and clearing for tourist infrastructure and related services are the main\ndeforestation drivers, additional to fuelwood and illegal timber extraction. Continual timber\nextraction eases the transition of forests to agriculture and pasture land use. The project aims to\nalleviate these pressures on the forests through the support of governance capacity (including\nindividual property titling, land-use planning and conservation zone demarcation), the generation\nof alternative economic activities and income sources, and through capacity building in\nadministration and management. These project activities, beyond protecting local forests and\nbiodiversity, contribute to social and economic development in one of the poorest areas of\nColombia. The effectiveness of these activities is partially dependent on their long-term economic\nsuccess and wide-spread adoption.\nSince the project\u2019s inception, local communities have been actively participating in the project\u2019s\nformulation and implementation. The early involvement of participating communities has created\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 155\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nawareness among community members and readiness for project implementation. Community\nsupport has culminated in the project\u2019s endorsement by the legal representatives of communities\nand the communities\u2019 General Assembly. These endorsements demonstrate the communities\u2019\nlong-term commitment to emissions reductions from avoided logging and deforestation.\nLocation of the project:\nThe project is located in the municipality of Acand\u00ed on the northwestern coast of the Gulf of Urab\u00e1\nin the Colombian department of Choco. This project area covers 10,433 hectares of forests and is\nlocated 162 km from Monteria, the capital of Department of C\u00f3rdoba, Colombia.\nThe project objectives are threefold: (i) to mitigate climate change by reducing deforestation and\nrecuperation of already degraded forest lands; (ii) contribute to biodiversity conservation including\nHigh Conservation Values, and, (iii) foster sustainable development of local communities. Following\nis a more detailed description of each objective.\ni) Climate Objectives\nThe project\u2019s climate objectives are to mitigate climate change through measures to alleviate the\ndrivers of deforestation. The resultant decrease in illegal logging, the recovery of already degraded\nforests, and the reduction of forest conversion to other land uses is expected to decrease emissions\nand enhance forest carbon stocks over time.\nii) Community Objectives\nThe project\u2019s community objectives are to strengthen livelihood capitals as defined by some of the\nBasic Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF) (Richards 2011). These are: (i) strengthening local\ngovernance through improvements to land-use planning and implementation; (ii) supporting the\ndevelopment of sustainable economic and livelihoods alternatives through training and technical\nassistance in agriculture and fisheries, harvesting equipment, and value chains for poor vulnerable\ncommunities; (iii) enhancing local administrative, leadership capacity and environmental\nawareness through training activities which intentionally include women from the communities; and\n(iv) enhancing social capital through the creation or strengthening of institutions (corporations,\nassociations, cooperatives).\niii) Biodiversity Objectives\nTo contribute to biodiversity conservation through long-term improvements and connectivity of\ndense natural forest cover and associated structural, compositional, functional and High\nConservation Value attributes, as compared to baseline scenario conditions"}]}

All the questionnairs are completed on 17 September 2009.\nSince no residents live close to the proposed project, almost no residents are expected to be easily\naffected by the on-site construction and operation. Therefore, it\u2019s reasonable to deliver the questionnaires\nto the residents within Toksun County.\nThe questionnaire was designed to be easily filled in with the following sections:\n1) Project introduction\n2) Questions on:\n\u2666 What impacts do you think the CDM Project activity will have on the environment in the local area?\n\u2666 What impacts do you think the CDM Project activity will have on the employment in the local area?\n\u2666 What impacts do you think the CDM Project activity will have on your livelihood?\n\u2666 What impacts do you think the CDM Project activity will have on the economic development in the\nlocal area?\n\u2666 What would be the overall effects of the construction and operation of the CDM Project activity?\n\u2666 Do they support the construction of the CDM Project?\n3) Informant\u2019s basic information and signature\nThe following is the summary background information of the informants:\nMale 31\nGender\nFemale 19\n\u226430 22\nAge 30~50 25\n\u226550 3\nElementary school 3\nEducation High school 13\nCollage\/university 34\nCivil servant 20\nOccupation Worker 7\nFarmer 3\n20 Despite there are no laws\/requirements for a stakeholder consultation process in China for the proposed project,\nthe project owner implemented the stakeholder consultation for CDM purpose.\nThis template shall not be altered. It shall be completed without modifying\/adding headings or logo, format or font."}]}

Power density of\nthe reservoir is greater than 4 W\/m2.\nSince there exists no delineation of project electricity system or connected electricity systems by DNA,\nfollowing criteria has been used to determine the existence of significant transmission constraints:\n\uf0b7 In case of electricity systems with spot markets for electricity: there are differences in electricity\nprices (without transmission and distribution costs) of more than 5 percent between the systems\nduring 60 percent or more of the hours of the year.\n\uf0b7 The transmission line is operated at 90% or more of its rated capacity during 90% percent or\nmore of the hours of the year.\nSince the project output is fed to the Turkish electricity grid which does not involve any distinct electricity\nsystems that applies different price, first criteria defined above is not applicable. Also, since the\ntransmission line between the proposed projects and nearest substation is built within the scope of the\nproject and there exist no information on grid capacity utilization, second criteria is also inapplicable.\nBased on assessment above, it is difficult to conclude with a significant transmission constraint or grid\nboundary. Since there is no dispatch grid system in Turkey, the project boundary is considered as the\nNational Electricity Grid of Turkey according to applied tool. The geographical and physical boundaries of\nthe Turkish grid and location of the power plants are well identified as given diagram below.\nFigure 5: Turkish National Grid"}]}

In terms of the WRC activity type, the project activity\naims to enhance mangrove ecosystems, and hence the WRC activity type represents RWE (Restoring\nWetland Ecosystems).\nProject is NOT a grouped project.\nAs per Section 2.1 of VCS Standard (Version 4.2), the project is subject to the six Kyoto Protocol\ngreenhouse gases, aiming to reduce the carbon and other greenhouses gases (GHG) emissions by\nrestoring the degraded mangrove forests. Hence, it falls under the ARR category. The methodology of the\nproject also refers to the latest version of the following tools approved by the Clean Development\nMechanism (Version 03.0): Afforestation and reforestation of degraded mangrove habitats (AR AM0014).\nIn addition, as per Section 3.2.8 of VCS Standard (Version 4.2), all ARR projects occurring on wetlands\nshall adhere to both the respective project category requirements and the WRC (Wetlands Restoration\nand Conservation) requirements, unless the expected emissions from the soil organic carbon pool or\nchange in the soil organic carbon pool in the project scenario is deemed below de minimis or can be\nconservatively excluded as set out in the VCS program document VCS Methodology Requirements, in\nwhich case the project shall not be subject to the WRC requirements. For this project soil organic carbon\n5\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nis an important part of the total amount of the carbon sequestrated, hence the project will comply with\nboth ARR requirements and WRC requirements. Upon the requirements, the periodic reassessment of\nthe baseline, at least not more than 10 years, will be undertaken to capture changes in the drivers and\/or\nbehavior of agents that cause the change in land use, hydrology, sediment supply and\/or land or water\nmanagement practices and changes in carbon stocks. At the time of baseline assessment, the project\ndescription will be updated by following the requirements of the latest approved version methodology."}]}

The end-user technology in the case of this project can\nbe established as the project proponent, who utilizes the thermal\nenergy generated by the new renewable energy technology.\nThere are no similar registered small-scale CDM project activities in\nthe region of S\u00e3o Miguel do Guam\u00e1 once Social Carbon Company made a\nresearch and did not find any registered small\u2013scale CDM Project\nactivity in the region. The sources of registered small-scale CDM\nproject activity consulted were the United Nations Framework Convention\non Climate Change (UNFCCC) 16 and Brazilian\u00b4s Technology and Science\nMinistry17. Therefore, the proposed project activity is not saving the\nnon-renewable biomass accounted for by the other registered project\nactivities.\nThe utilization of firewood from area without any kind of management\ncan not be considered a renewable source of biomass, since it involves\na decrease of carbon pools and increases the carbon emissions to the\natmosphere, turning green house effect even worse. Moreover, the native\nwood provided from areas without a reforestation management plan does\nnot fit any of the options of UNFCCC definition of renewable biomass in\nAnnex 18, EB 23.\n16 CDM activities registered by CDM Executive board are Available at:<\nhttp:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/Projects\/registered.html>.

Although, it is impossible to define a start date on which\nthis kind of non-renewable biomass began to be applied, there are many\ndocuments to prove that wood has been used for thermal energy\ngeneration before 1989 as requested in the applied methodology.\nFirewood used to be the most employed source of primary energy until de\ndecade of 1970, when the petroleum started to supply the majority of\nBrazilian\u2019s energy needs19. Moreover the Brazilian\u2019s Energy and Mine\nMinistry has been monitoring every energetic sectors of Brazil since\n1970, and firewood appears over the years monitored as a significant\nsource of thermal energy for ceramic sector20. Especially in the ceramic\nsector, the use of firewood is visible non-renewable and unsustainable,\ninvolving negative environmental impacts associated21.\nThis way, it can be concluded that non-renewable biomass has been used\nsince 31 December 1989.\nSawdust\/wood chips are forest residues while a\u00e7a\u00ed pits and rice husk\nare agro-industries residues, so they are considered renewable\naccording to option V of methodology definition of renewable biomass:\n\u201cThe biomass is the non-fossil fraction of an industrial or municipal\nwaste\u201d. Besides, sawdust, a\u00e7a\u00ed pits and rice husk are common residues\nin the region generated.\nThe elephant grass is considered renewable according to option III, as\nsoon as it fit all the assumptions below:\n\u201cThe biomass is non-woody biomass and originates from croplands and\/or\ngrasslands where:\n(a) The land area remains cropland and\/or grasslands or is reverted to\nforest; and\n(b) Sustainable management practices are undertaken on these land areas\nto ensure in particular that the level of carbon stocks on these land\nareas does not systematically decrease over time (carbon stocks may\ntemporarily decrease due to harvesting); and\n(c) Any national or regional forestry, agriculture and nature\nconservation regulations are complied with.\u201d\nMoreover, the project activity will annually generate less than 45\nMWThermal."}]}

Description of the proposed ARR VCS project activity:\nOverview: The proposed ARR VCS project activity described in this document is for two separate\nareas namely, Uchindile Forest Project (UFP) and Mapanda Forest Project (MFP), located in the\nsouthern part of Tanzania in the districts of Kilombero, Morogoro Region and Mufindi, Iringa\nRegion. Both these areas contain multiple \u201cdiscrete areas of land\u201d where planting will take place.\nObjectives of the proposed ARR VCS project activity:\n\u2022 To establish and manage forest plantations so as to contribute to the demand of high quality\nwood products from a sustainable managed forest. NB: The Government of Tanzania,\nthrough the Forestry Division in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism (MNRT)\nencourages establishment of private forests plantations and admits that limited government\nfinancing has been a major set back in developing new forest plantations in the country1,2.\nThe implementation of the proposed ARR VCS project activity will therefore, benefit the\nforestry sector through an increase in the resource supply, management and overall\nsustainability.\n\u2022 To sequester CO through forest planting in grassland areas, generating high quality 2\nemission reductions in greenhouse gases (GHG) that can be measured, monitored and\nverified. The project participants strive to demonstrate that carbon sequestration from forest\nplantations is a viable instrument to encourage private investment in the forestry sector\nespecially on grasslands and\/or degraded lands.\n\u2022 To promote environmental conservation, such as soil conservation, protection of water\nsources and enhancement of biodiversity through the protection and management of\n1 The forests in Tanzania, mostly public\/natural forests, are under pressure of deforestation at an estimated annual rate\nranging from 150, 000ha -450,000ha (Source: The Tanzania National Forest Policy (MNRT, 1998)). The Tanzania Forest\nAction Plan (MNRT, 2000) mentions Kilombero Forest Project (now called Uchindile Forest Project) as the only private\nplantation forest aiming at CO sequestration and generation of VCUs for sale. 2\n2 The Forest Policy (MNRT, 1998) and Forest Law (Forest Act, 2002) gives opportunities to the private sector to play\nkey roles in the national economy, not only in the development of forestry sector but also to buy shares in the public\nindustries including the public forestry industries: Mugasha et al, , (2004), Indicators and Tools for Restoration and\nSustainable Management of Forests in East Africa, I-TOO working paper No. 3, State of Forests and Forestry Research in\nTanzania, page 31.\n3\n\n[['Species', 'Type', 'Uses'], ['Pinus Patula', 'Exotic softwood', 'Timber'], ['Eucalyptus Saligna', 'Exotic hardwood', 'Poles'], ['Eucalyptus Globulus', 'Exotic hardwood', 'Poles'], ['Eucalyptus Camadulensis', 'Exotic hardwood', 'Poles']]\nUNFCCC\/CCNUCC\n________________________________________________________________________________\n____\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM\nFOR AFFORESTATION AND REFORESTATION PROJECT ACTIVITIES (CDM-AR-PDD) -\nVersion 03\nexisting indigenous flora and fauna and where possible enrichment planting with\nindigenous species and fruits.\n\u2022 To facilitate socio-economic development of the local communities through:\n\u2013 promotion of tree planting\/reforestation activities in the local communities;\n\u2013 providing employment opportunities;\n\u2013 generation of income for the communities through the sale of carbon credits (10% of\nthe benefits of all carbon credits will be used for community development projects)\n\u2022 Infrastructure development of roads, buildings and other aspects, such as water supply and\ncommunication systems.\n\u2022 To create employment to other Tanzanians apart from those in the village local\ncommunities.\nTo achieve these objectives, the proposed ARR VCS project activity will establish plantation\nforests at two discrete areas of land (for the location of the discrete areas, see figure A.1):\n1. Uchindile: total area 12,121 ha (as stated on the title deed) of which 7,252 ha will be\nplanted; and,\n2. Mapanda: total area 6,258 (as stated on the title deed) of which 3,562 ha will be planted.\nSpecies to be planted are shown in Table A.2.1. The species have been screened against the\ninformation provided in the global database of invasive species and are not invasive in Tanzania.\nTable A.2.1: Species to be planted in the discrete areas of land\nFor a map of the locations of the project areas, see Figure A.4.1.\nThe proposed ARR VCS project activity is a reforestation project. The source of information that\ndates back longest is the local population that reports on forests in the valleys and grasslands on the\nhill tops. According to them, the forest areas have been pushed back further into the riverine areas\nup until about two to three generations ago (1960s). The first documented sources of information\nare maps compiled between 1977 and 1983 that indicate the area was grassland at that time. The\nsatellite images that are available closest to 1990 and that cover the land area of the project show\nthat these areas have remained grassland.\nThe idea for the project started in 1997, when the company realised that planting trees and fighting\nclimate change go hand in hand. Some planting was undertaken from year 1997 to 1999 on a trial\nbasis in both areas (financed with private money). Foreign investments were invited but did not\nreally take off until 2004 when the 9th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in 2003 agreed on\nthe rules for VCS ARR project activities.

For such cases, the tool suggests using the following criteria to determine the\nexistence of significant transmission constraints:\n1. \u201cIn case of electricity systems with spot markets for electricity: there are differences in electricity\nprices (without transmission and distribution costs) of more than 5 percent between the systems\nduring 60 percent or more of the hours of the year.\u201d This criteria is not applicable as there is no\nspot electricity market in the host country.\n2. \u201cThe transmission line is operated at 90% or more of its rated capacity during 90% percent or\nmore of the hours of the year\u201d: The transmission line operator (TEIAS) or any other official source\nhas not published the capacity usage figures for the Turkish grid, hence this criterion can not be\nproved.\nAccording to the tool, where the application of these criteria does not result in a clear grid\nboundary, a regional grid definition in the case of large countries with layered dispatch systems\n(e.g. provincial \/ regional \/ national) shall be used. A provincial grid definition may indeed in many\ncases be too narrow given significant electricity trade among provinces that might be affected,\ndirectly or indirectly, by a CDM project activity. In other countries, the national (or other largest)\ngrid definition should be used by default.\nTherefore, for the case of the subject project activity \u201cthe project electricity system\u201d and \u201cthe\nconnected system\u201d are same, and the Turkish National Grid is used as the \u201cproject electricity\nsystem\u201d. It is also confirmed by TEIAS that the Turkish grid is interconnected. There isn\u2019t any\nindependent or regional grid system in any region of Turkey.

The Project Area\nhas been put under a 60-year term conservation easement with The Nature Conservancy (TNC)\nwith the intention of conserving the property and managing its forest resources sustainably into\nperpetuity. The Project Area has ecological, scientific, educational and aesthetic value in its\npresent state as a natural area that has not been subject to development or severe exploitation.\nThe Project Area is comprised of primarily native forest types characteristic of the region and\nsurrounds the headwaters of Tunkhannock Creek and Wild Creek that flow into the Delaware\nBasin. Interspersed with the hardwood forests are significant stands of mixed conifers and special\nhabitat types including wetlands that provided habitat for a multitude of rare species and natural\ncommunities.\nThe project will extend the rotation age of the timber resource on the property by approximately\n70 years compared to Common Practice, thereby reducing carbon emissions and increasing\ncarbon sequestration. The project activity will employ a sustainable level of harvesting, as\nspecified in the FSC compliant management plan required by the conservation easement, and\nwill facilitate improvements in the overall health of the forest.\nWhile executing this carbon stock enhancing harvest strategy, management practices will vary to\nsome degree based on the unique ecological features of the Wild Creek and Tunkhannock tracts.\nWithin the Wild Creek Tract, management will be tailored for species diversity with primary target\nspecies of red oak, white oak, chestnut oak, red maple and white pine. The age structure, which\nis currently over-weighted in the two main age classes (90-120 and 60-75 years), will be better\ndistributed through regeneration in appropriate areas to create vigorous young stands of early\nsuccessional habitat while other stands are thinned and allowed to mature. The tract\u2019s\nplantations will be managed to optimal stocking for improved health, better growth and extended\nrotations. The deer herd will be controlled via increased hunting to allow the slow establishment\nof advanced oak regeneration, creating conditions where shelterwood management will\nsuccessfully regenerate the oak forests. As healthy stands are allowed to mature and\noverstocked stands are thinned to control species and spacing, the property should experience\nforest stocking of increasing volume and value. Once these management goals are achieved, the\nAuthority intends to continue to manage the forest under a long rotation harvest regime designed\nto sustain the forest\u2019s health and promote the ecosystem services it provides.\nThe Tunkhannock tract will be managed to promote healthy and expanding populations of rare,\nthreatened, and endangered species, while encouraging increased carbon stocks. Black cherry,\nred maple, sugar maple, red oak, white oak, white pine and red spruce will be targeted species in\nthe upland areas for value growth and regeneration and the percent stocking of beech will be\nreduced over time. The future forest will have a more diverse age class and species mix where\nportions of the current northern hardwood forest of 100-120 yr old stands will be successfully\nregenerated. Forest growth in terms of timber value and carbon capture will both be accelerated\nv3.1 3\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION: VCS Version 3\nthrough (1) thinnings to control species and spacing, and (2) successful regeneration to\novercome pressure from deer browse and competing vegetation which currently preclude new\nage classes of seedling establishment.

No', 'Source of electricity generation', 'Percentage Share'], ['1', 'Thermal', '68.32 %'], ['4', 'Hydro', '26.12 %']]\n2.2 Justification of the choice of the methodology and why it is applicable to the\nproject activity:\nThe applicability criteria of the methodology AMS-I.D. and their relevance with respect to the\nproject activity under consideration are addressed as follows:\n1. \u201cThis category comprises renewable energy generation units, such as photovoltaics,\nhydro, tidal\/wave, wind, geothermal and renewable biomass, that supply electricity to and\/or\ndisplace electricity from an electricity distribution system that is or would have been supplied\nby at least one fossil fuel fired generating unit.\u201d\nThe project activity involves the setting up of wind farms, i.e., renewable generating units of\ncumulative generation capacity 15 MW to harness a renewable source of energy (wind power\npotential) and export the generated electricity to the fossil fuel dominated electricity\ngeneration and distribution system, i.e. the NEWNE Regional Electricity Grid of India3. In\nthe process, an equivalent quantum of electricity that would have been generated by the grid\nin line with the grid electricity generation mix is displaced by the project activity. The carbon\nintensity of the fossil-fuel dominated generation mix of the grid is evident from the following\nbreak-up of various types of energy sources constituting the grid-mix contributing electricity\nto the NEWNE Grid system, as shown in Table below Mar 05.\n3 The NEWNE Regional Electricity Grid of India is primarily constituted of fossil- fuel fired thermal power plants. Refer to CO 2\nBaseline Database Version 4.0 Dated October 2008 available at\nhttp:\/\/www.cea.nic.in\/planning\/c%20and%20e\/Government%20of%20India%20website.htm\n11\n\n[['5', 'Nuclear', '2.34%'], ['6', 'Renewable energy sources (Wind,\\nsolar, biomass etc)', '3.22 %']]\nVCS Project Description Template\n(Source :http:\/\/www.cea.nic.in\/ceaarchive\/body\/Reports\/Executive%20Summary\/2006\/2006_06\/8.pdf\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n2. \u201cIf the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a\nwind\/diesel unit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small-scale CDM project activity applies\nonly to the renewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel, the capacity of the\nentire unit shall not exceed the limit of 15MW\u201d.\nThe project activity involves only wind power generation. The gross wind power generation\ncapacity of the project activity is 15 MW which is meets the eligibility limit of small-scale\nCDM project activity, as stipulated in the applicability criterion under consideration.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n3. \u201cCombined heat and power (co-generation) systems are not eligible under this\ncategory\u201d\nThe project activity involves generation of electricity only through WTGs and is not a co-\ngeneration system. Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n4. \u201cIn the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy\ngeneration units at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added capacity of the\nunits added by the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be physically distinct\nfrom the existing units.\u201d\nThe project activity does not involve the addition of renewable energy generation units at an\nexisting renewable power generation facility. Hence the project activity complies with this\ncriterion.\n5. \u201cProject activities that seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for renewable\nenergy generation are included in this category. To qualify as a small scale project, the total\noutput of the modified or retrofitted unit shall not exceed the limit of 15 MW\u201d\nThe renewable energy generating wind-farms employed by the project activity are newly\nconstructed set up and do not involve retrofitting or modification of any existing facility for\nrenewable energy generation. Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.\nThus, the project activity fulfills all the applicability criteria of the simplified small scale\nmethodology AMS-I.D.\/ Version 14."}]}

This methodology is applicable to grid-connected renewable energy power generation project activities\nthat:\n(a) Install a Greenfield power plant; - this is the case.\n(b) Involve a capacity addition to (an) existing plant(s);\n(c) Involve a retrofit of (an) existing operating plants\/units;\n(d) Involve a rehabilitation of (an) existing plant(s)\/unit(s); or\n(e) Involve a replacement of (an) existing plant(s)\/unit(s).\n4. The methodology is applicable under the following conditions:\n(a) The project activity may include renewable energy power plant\/unit of one of the following types: hydro\nPower plant\/unit with or without reservoir, wind power plant\/unit, geothermal power plant\/unit, solar\npower plant\/unit, wave power plant\/unit or tidal power plant\/unit; \u201d\nOutcome: applicability condition is fulfilled, considering that the project activity is the\ninstallation of a Greenfield power plant (a) type: \u201chydro power plant\/unit with reservoir\u201d.\n(b) In the case of capacity additions, retrofits, rehabilitations or replacements (except for wind, solar,\nwave or tidal power capacity addition projects) the existing plant\/unit started commercial\noperation prior to the start of a minimum historical reference period of five years, used for the\ncalculation of baseline emissions and defined in the baseline emission section, and no capacity\nexpansion, retrofit, or rehabilitation of the plant\/unit has been undertaken between the start of\nthis minimum historical reference period and the implementation of the project activity.\nOutcome: since the proposed project does not involve capacity addition, retrofits or\nreplacements, this applicability condition is not applied.\n5. In case of hydro power plants one of the following conditions must apply:\n(a) The project activity is implemented in an existing single or multiple reservoir, with no\nchange in the volume of reservoir; or\n(b) The project activity is implemented in existing single or multiple reservoirs, where the\nvolume of the reservoir(s) is increased and the power density, calculated using\nequation (7), is greater than 4 W\/m2; or\n(c) The project activity results in new single or multiple reservoirs and the power density,\ncalculated using equation (7), is greater than 4 W\/m2; or\n(d) The project activity is an integrated hydro power project involving multiple reservoirs,\nwhere the power density for any of the reservoirs, calculated using equation (7), is\nlower than or equal to 4 W\/m2, all of the following conditions shall apply:\n(i) The power density calculated using the total installed capacity of the integrated\n16\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nproject, as per equation (8), is greater than 4 W\/m2;\n(ii) Water flow between reservoirs is not used by any other hydropower unit which is not\na part of the project activity;\n(iii) Installed capacity of the power plant(s) with power density lower than or equal to 4\nW\/m2 shall be:\na. Lower than or equal to 15 MW; and\nb. Less than 10 per cent of the total installed capacity of integrated hydro power\nproject.\nOutcome: The project activity involves new reservoirs and the project activity of the power plant\nis greater than 4 W\/m2.\n6. In the case of integrated hydro power projects, project proponent shall:\n(a) Demonstrate that water flow from upstream power plants\/units spill directly to the downstream\nreservoir and that collectively constitute to the generation capacity of the integrated hydro power\nproject; or\n(b) Provide an analysis of the water balance covering the water fed to power units, with all possible\ncombinations of reservoirs and without the construction of reservoirs. The purpose of water\nbalance is to demonstrate the requirement of specific combination of reservoirs constructed\nunder CDM project activity for the optimization of power output. This demonstration has to be\ncarried out in the specific scenario of water availability in different seasons to optimize the water\nflow at the inlet of power units. Therefore, this water balance will take into account seasonal flows\nfrom river, tributaries (if any), and rainfall for minimum of five years prior to the implementation of\nthe CDM project activity.\nOutcome: The project activity does not involve integrated hydro power projects. This applicability\ncondition is not applied.\n7. The methodology is not applicable to:\n(a) Project activities that involve switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources at\nthe site of the project activity, since in this case the baseline may be the continued use\nof fossil fuels at the site;\n(b) Biomass fired power plants.\u201d\nOutcome: applicability condition fulfilled. The project activity is a hydro power project. It does\nnot involve fuel switch, biomass fired power plants.\n8. In case of retrofits, replacements, or capacity additions, this methodology is only applicable if the\nmost plausible baseline scenario, as a result of the identification of baseline scenario, is the\n17\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\n\u201ccontinuation of the current situation, i.e. to use the power generation equipment that was already in\nuse prior to the implementation of the project activity and undertaking business as usual\nmaintenance\u201d.\nOutcome: Since the project does not involve retrofits, replacements or capacity addition, this\napplicability condition is not applied.\n9. In addition, the applicability conditions included in the tools referred to below apply.\n(a) \u201cTOOL01: Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality\u201d \u2013 not used.\n(b) \u201cTOOL02: Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality\u201d \u2013 not used.\n(c) \u201cTOOL03: Tool to calculate project or leakage CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion\u201d \u2013 not used.\n(d) \u201cTOOL05: Baseline, project and\/or leakage emissions from electricity consumption and monitoring of\nelectricity generation\u201d.\n(e) \u201cTOOL07: Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system\u201d;\n(f) \u201cTOOL10: Tool to determine the remaining lifetime of equipment\u201d \u2013 not used.\n(g) \u201cTOOL11: Assessment of the validity of the original\/current baseline and update of the baseline at the\nrenewal of the crediting period\u201d;\n(h) \u201cTOOL32: Positive lists of technologies\u201d \u2013 not used.\nSo the ACM0002 methodology is applicable and has included the standardized baseline."}]}

Jiuquan City is located in the\nnorthwest of Gansu Province and in the western of Hexi corridor where the Qinghai Tibet\nPlateau and Mongolia Plateau. The objective of the project is to restore the degraded\ngrassland ecosystem through the sustainable grassland management practices, such as\nincreasing the rotation of grazing between summer and winter pastures, limiting the\ngrazing days on degraded pastures, and replanting with perennial grasses and ensuring\nappropriate management over the long-term, thereby increasing carbon sequestration,\nand promoting local development.\nAccording to the Parameters for Degradation, Sandification and Salification of\nRangelands (National standard of China, GB19377-2003)13, and Project Design Report,\nmoderately degraded areas refer to the total grass yield decreased by 21%-50% compared\nwith that before degradation and the total grass yield decreased by 50% compared with\nthat before degradation is regarded as severely degraded grasslands. Based on the\nParticipatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) report of the project, before the implementation of\nthe project, most of the grassland within the project area were moderately degraded\ndue to overgrazing for the past decades, the high-quality forage in the plant\ncommunity nearly disappeared, and the natural regeneration and renewal ability of the\ngrassland was very low.\nIn total, 267,763.28 ha of degraded grassland in Guazhou have been managed\nsustainably through rest and rotational grazing, fence building, and grass seeding with\nhigh-quality native forage.\nGrass seeding was implemented on 7,635.38 ha of severely degraded grassland within\nthe project boundary. Suitable native grass species including Agropyron cristatum,\nFestuca ovina, Puccinellia distans and Iris lacteal were selected for seeding based on the\nsoil, climate conditions in the project area and the past experience of grazing restoration.\nAt the end of the seeding period the grassland was fenced off for improved management.\nGrazing was strictly prohibited in the first year after seeding to ensure that the grassland\nvegetation can be rejuvenated in the short term, and grazing can be resumed in the second\nor third year according to the local livestock carrying capacity.\nRest and rotational grazing with fence building were implemented in 260,127.90\nha of moderately degraded grassland in order to gradually restore grassland vegetation\nand reduce soil erosion. The alignment of the fence route was determined based on the\n13 GB19377-2003 is a national standard document of the people's Republic of China which issued by The Ministry\nof Agriculture and Rural Affairs to assess the level of degradation, desertification and salinization of natural\ngrassland.

A seasonal rest grazing system was in place in the\nfenced pastures, with the rest period running from 1 May to 31 August, and full-time\nkeepers were arranged to inspect them. After measuring and assessing the recovery status\nof the pasture, grasslands were divided into seasonal grazing land and light grazing\nwas carried out in winter, spring and autumn depending on the vegetation condition.\nBesides these main restoration measures, the project also alleviates soil desertification\nand restore grassland vegetation to improve soil carbon storage and local biodiversity\nthrough grassland management measures, such as daily management measures from\nother protect projects like rodent and pest control and grassland fire prevention to ensure\nthe long-term sustainable management of the project area. The project is estimated to\ngenerate GHG emission removals of 16,274,727 tCO e in 40 years, with an average 2\nannual GHG emission removal of 406,868 tCO e. 2\nThe objectives of the project including:\nClimate: Restore the degraded grassland ecosystem, increase grassland coverage, increase\ngrassland carbon sink function and reduce GHG emissions.\nCommunity: Improve the livelihood of local herders, provide permanent and temporary\njob opportunities for them, increase their income. Provide technical skills and training in\nsustainable grassland management, increase interaction within the community and improve\nthe well-being of local communities.\nBiodiversity: Provide more suitable habitats for wild animals and increase local\nbiodiversity."}]}

The project activity is a renewable\nbiomass based thermal energy generation project. The project activity entails\ninstallation of a biomass fired boiler to meet the process steam requirements.\nThereby the primary applicability of the category I C is suitably justified. The\ndetailed justification on applicability of the methodology to the project activity\nis provided below.\nJustification of applicability of the methodology\n1. This category comprises renewable energy technologies that supply\nindividual households or users with thermal energy that displaces fossil fuels.\nExamples include solar thermal water heaters and dryers, solar cookers, energy\nderived from renewable biomass for water heating, space heating or drying and\nother technologies that provide thermal energy that displaces fossil fuel.\nBiomass based co-generating systems that produce heat and electricity are\nincluded in this category.\nThe project activity is use of biomass in boiler to meet the process heat energy\nrequirement by avoiding the use of fossil fuel in boiler. Hence this satisfies the\nfirst applicability condition of the methodology.\n2. Where thermal generation capacity is specified by the manufacturer. It shall\nbe less than 45 MW . th\n3\nhttp:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/UserManagement\/FileStorage\/CDMWF_AM_YL0327DQSKVFXYQREWRT3V\nNR58402G\n13\n\n[['Boiler Capacity', 'TPH', '8'], ['Temperature', 'deg. C', '170'], ['Pressure', 'kg\/cm2', '11.25'], ['Steam Enthalpy', 'kJ\/kg', '2784.5'], ['Inlet Water\\nTemp.', 'deg. C', '70'], ['Water Enthalpy', 'kJ\/kg', '293.10'], ['Thermal Output', 'MWthermal', '5.54']]\nUnder the project activity a 8 TPH capacity boiler with a pressure rating of\n11.25 kg\/cm2 steam outlet pressure and 170 0C saturated steam temperature is\ninstalled. The thermal energy production capacity of this boiler is 5.54 MW\nthermal (less than 45 MWthermal). As the MWth is less than 45 MWth, it\nqualifies the project as a small scale activity as per the condition given in the\nmethodology.\n3. For Co- fired systems the aggregate installed capacity(Specific for fossil fuel\nuse) of all the systems affected by the project activity shall not exceed 45 MWth.\nCogeneration projects that displace\/avoid fossil fuel consumption in the\nproduction of thermal energy(eg. Steam or process heat) and\/or electricity shall\nuse this methodology. The capacity of the project in this case shall be the\nthermal energy production capacity ie 45 MWth.\nThis case is not relevant to the project activity as the aim of the project activity\nis to use only biomass residue as fuel in the project activity and no other fossil\nfuel will be used.\n4. In the case of the project activity that involves the addition of renewable\nenergy unit at an existing renewable facility. The total capacity of the units\nadded by the project should be lower than 45MWth and should be physically\ndistinct from the existing units.\nThe above mentioned case is not relevant to the project activity as the project\nactivity is the first ever installation of renewable energy facility in the plant.\nIt can be concluded from the above mentioned points that the project activity\nsatisfies all the applicability conditions of the methodology and hence this\nmethodology is applicable in context with the project activity."}]}

The project aims to restore the local degraded\ngrassland ecosystem by Improved sustainable grassland management measures, such as rotating grazing\nand grazing prohibition in the project area by building fences, and improving the degraded grassland\necosystem by reseeding high-quality local grass seeds. After the implementation of the project, the\ngrassland will be scientifically and rationally utilized according to the health status of the local grassland\necosystem. Achieve long-term sustainable management of degraded local grasslands. The implementation\nof the project has significantly improved the local climate benefits, community benefits and biodiversity\nbenefits. The project sponsor is Xinjiang Altay City Zhujin Investment Co., LTD..\nAccording to the Parameters for Degradation, Sandification and Salification of Rangelands15 (National\nstandard of China, GB19377-2003) and Project Design Report, moderately degraded areas refer to the\ntotal grass yield decreased by 21%-50% compared with that before degradation and the total grass yield\ndecreased by 50% compared with that before degradation is regarded as severely degraded grasslands.\nAccording to the baseline survey, before the implementation of the project, the grassland in the project area\nwas facing serious degradation and even desertification due to the impact of climate change and human\nactivities, most of them were moderately degraded while some of them even severely degraded for years.\nTotally, 266,655.29 ha (or 3999829.35 Mu16) of degraded grassland in Altay City have been managed\nsustainably including grazing prohibition, rotational grazing and reseeding of local high-quality forage.\nAnd that reduce net GHG emissions by increasing carbon stocks and\/or reducing non-CO2 GHG emissions.\nThere are three main restoration measures as followed in the project:\nRotational grazing was implement in moderately degraded grasslands where grass yield is about 185.73\nkg\/Mu which decreased by 43.44% compared with the non-degraded grassland date in 201117. It requires\nthat the grazing time shall be halved by dividing grasslands into seasonal grazing land according to the\nlivestock carrying capacity of the grassland by fence building. Then based on specified order, grazing cycle\nand zoning grazing time, the grassland is grazed area by area and used in turn. 229,060.82 ha of degraded\ngrassland have been managed sustainable by the implementation of rotational grazing.\nimplement in moderately degraded grasslands where grass seeds of local\nsowed such as Medicago sativa (Lucerne), Agropyron cristatum (Ice grass),\nBromus inermis (Awnless brome) and Festuca arundinacea (Tall fescue). The total area of high quality\nforage seeds sown in this project is 7,598.05 ha.

The project activity falls under the small scale projects. The methodology chosen for\nthe project activity and its applicability to the project activity is discussed below.\nType I: Renewable Energy Projects\nCategory D: Grid Connected Renewable Electricity Generation\nTechnology\/measure\n1. This category comprises renewable energy generation units, such as photovoltaics, hydro,\ntidal\/wave, wind, geothermal and renewable biomass, that supply electricity to and\/or\ndisplace electricity from an electricity distribution system that is or would have been supplied\nby at least one fossil fuel fired generating unit.\n2. If the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a wind\/diesel\nunit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small- scale CDM project activity applies only to the\nrenewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel5, the capacity of the entire unit\nshall not exceed the limit of 15MW.\n3. Combined heat and power (co- generation) systems are not eligible under this category.\n4. In the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy generation\nunits at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added capacity of the units added\nby the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be physically distinct6from the\nexisting units.\n5. Project activities that seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for renewable energy\ngeneration are included in this category. To qualify as a small scale project, the total output of\nthe modified or retrofitted unit shall not exceed the limit of 15 MW.\nThis project activity comes under point number 1 of the technology \/measures of AMS I-D.\nThe applicability of this methodology may be explained through the following arguments\n\u2022 The project activity involves electricity generation using renewable energy which is\nbased on wind power and sale of the electricity generated to the respective ESCOM\u2019s.\n5 Co-fired system uses both fossil and renewable fuels.\n6 Physically distinct units are those that are capable of generating electricity without the operation of\nexisting units, and that do not directly affect the mechanical, thermal, or electrical characteristics of the\nexisting facility. For example, the addition of a steam turbine to an existing combustion turbine to\ncreate a combined cycle unit would not be considered \u201cphysically distinct\u201d.\n12\n\nVCS Project Description Template\nThis project activity displaces the equivalent amount of electricity generation through\nthe operation of existing\/proposed fossil fuel based power plants connected to the\nGrid.\n\u2022 The project activity involves installation of renewable energy generation units only\n(Wind Turbine Generators)\n\u2022 The project activity doesn\u2019t involve cogeneration system. The project activity\ninvolves electricity generation from the Wind Turbine Generators.\n\u2022 The project activity doesn\u2019t involve addition of renewable energy generation units at\nexisting power generation facility.\n\u2022 The project activity doesn\u2019t seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for\nrenewable energy generation.\n\u2022 The total installed capacity of the project activity is 10.25 MW which is less than the\neligibility limit of 15 MW to qualify as a small scale project activity under Type I of\nthe small scale methodologies Also no additional WTGs will be added to the project\nactivity during its lifetime; Hence the project activity will remain under small scale\nproject activity during every year of crediting period.\nHence it can be concluded that the selected methodology, AMS I D \u2013 Grid Connected\nRenewable Electricity Generation is applicable to project activity"}]}

It strengthens the government\u2019s capacity and the community-\ngovernment relationship to reduce deforestation and forest degradation in Bago Region. The Bago\nRegion is an administrative region in Myanmar that includes the four Districts of Bago, Pyay,\nTharrawaddy and Taungoo. The forest areas included in this grouped project are Reserve Forests,\nProtected Public Protected Areas which are subject to unplanned deforestation and degradation due\nto subsistence-based activities, illegal over extraction on areas designated as plantations within the\nReserve Forests and other illegal drivers.\nThe first Project Activity Instance of this grouped Program is the priority area of North Zamari, which\nis a newly created Wildlife Sanctuary of 72,695 hectares in the Tharrawaddy District. The North Zamari\nWildlife Sanctuary (NZWS) is where the Forest Department is implementing its first forest conservation\nproject with resources from the Korea-Myanmar Joint REDD+ Program. The objective is to add\nadditional Project Activity Instances as more funding is secured and the project can demonstrate it\ncan reduce deforestation, conserve and enhance forests and support forest-reliant communities in\nsustainable development.\nThe NZWS Project Activity Instance is located in the Bago Mountain Range in the Bago Region in central\nMyanmar, roughly equidistant between the economic powerhouse of the city of Yangon and the\npolitical capital of city of Nay Pyi Taw. The NZWS Project Activity Instance encompasses what was the\nNorth Zamari Reserve Forest, a bastion of biodiversity in a mountain range subjected to decades of\nunsustainable logging. In 2014 under The Protection of Wildlife and Conservation of Natural Areas Law\n(The State Law and Order Restoration Council Law No. 6\/94 - 8th June, 1994 ), the Reserve Forest was\ndesignated officially as a Protect Area of the type \u201cWildlife Sanctuary\u201d which on paper demonstrated\nthe intent to protect the abundant biodiversity in the area, however clearing of forest land has\npersisted, driven by a massive expansion in Myanmar\u2019s economy following the country\u2019s transition to\nan open democracy, increased forest access and the conversion of forest land into agricultural\nproduction. The Bago Region REDD+ Program ultimately aims to promote sustainable development in\nthe region, reducing deforestation and protecting biodiversity while also fundamentally improving the\nlivelihoods of the local communities.\nThe Program is being implemented by Forest Department of Ministry of Natural Resources and\nEnvironmental Conservation (Forest Department), with support from the Korean Forest Service and\nTerra Global. Within the Forest Department, an entity called the Program Management Unit (PMU) is\ndedicated to support the Program establishment and implementation. As the Program\nimplementation advances a dedicated entity called the Bago Region REDD+ Entity (RMU) will be\ndeveloped and staffed to oversee implementation of the initial Project Zone Instance and most likely\nfurther instances.\nThe initial Program Activities are focused in the NZWS Project Zone Instance which is the area of\nimpact and influence around the NZWS Project Activity Instance. This zone has been developed based\non communities located near NZWS Project Zone Instance, mobility and access, analysis of expected\nshort and medium-term outcomes from implementation and how these will lead to desired social\nimpacts for stakeholders and long-term climate and biodiversity impacts.\nBeyond the conversion of the area to a Wildlife Sanctuary, the project activities to be implemented\nwithin the NZWS Project Zone Instance are designed to reduce deforestation through improved\ngovernance and enforcement as well as social programs to address the main drivers, agents and\nBago Region REDD+ North Zamari REDD+ Program Page 12 of 245\n\n[['Total estimated ERs [tCO2e]', '2 ,870,638'], ['No. of crediting years', '30'], ['Average annual ERs [tCO2e yr-1]', '95,688']]\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 4\nunderlying causes of deforestation.

The\nmain objectives are three-fold: 1) mitigation of climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions\nfrom land-use activities that result in deforestation and degradation, 2) improve community\nlivelihoods, especially for women and minorities, by strengthening community land-use rights and\nthrough alternative livelihood activities and carbon finance, and 3) contribute to the conservation of\nbiodiversity by protecting existing forests and the ecosystems and communities they support."}]}

First group of Instances\n20\n\nConservation Concession TINGANA5\nThe TINGANA Conservation Concession, has an area of 2867.84 ha according to Executive\nDirectorial Resolution N\u00b0 335-2017\/GRSM\/ARA\/DEACRN. It is in Peru, Department of San\nMartin, Province of Moyobamba, Districts of Moyobamba and Yantal\u00f3, and is part of the state\nproperty called Zona de Conservaci\u00f3n y Recuperaci\u00f3n de Ecosistemas (ZoCRE) Humedal del Alto\nMayo. The concession was granted by the San Martin Regional Environmental Authority to the\nAsociaci\u00f3n de Conservaci\u00f3n de Aguajales y Renacales del Alto Mayo -ADECARAM, through the\nConcession Contract for Conservation Purposes N\u00b0 22-SAM\/CON-CON-2017-02.\nADECARAM was formed by the first founding partners of the venture and currently guides tourists\nthrough the Tingana conservation area. It is a non-profit organization that works to help families\nin the Tingana ecosystem improve their quality of life through the recovery, conservation and\nsustainable use of ecosystem services and biological diversity. Its main activities focus on\necotourism, as well as developing sustainable productive activities and strengthening member\nenterprises.\nTINGANA is located in a very humid forest-premontane ecosystem, where a landscape of\naguacales and renacales predominates. This life zones are composed of evergreen trees, some\ndominant and almost all emerging are heliophilous and lose their leaves during the dry season,\nflowering some very colorful, such as Erythrina, Tabebuia and Jacaranda among the most\nimportant. It is located on the sub-basin of the Avisado River, on the left bank of the Mayo River,\nconstituting a community adapted to travel its territory floating on the water.\nThe main productive activities in the region are irrigated rice, pasture and cattle raising, coffee,\nvanilla, cacao and crops such as plantain, corn, yucca and camu camu to a minor extent. Income\nis also generated from aguaje extraction when it is in season and, as previously mentioned,\nthrough ecotourism and sustainable production, such as guiding, lodging, food services,\ntransportation, vanilla products, regional liquors, and honey.\nDespite the efforts made by the community and ADECARAM to conserve their territory, new\nconservation challenges continue to emerge. The expansion of the agricultural frontier for rice\ncrops and livestock, the construction of trails or tertiary roads for transport, combined with a\nshortage of opportunities, technical assistance, income diversification and difficulty in accessing\nmarkets, are identified as the driving factors behind deforestation. On the other hand, the lack\nof support in terms of monitoring and surveillance by the authorities has led to conflicts with the\nneighboring population seeking new territories to develop their economic activities.\nIn this context, the project seeks to develop, within the project activities, improvements in\necotourism activities; implement sustainable agricultural systems such as vanilla, coffee, aguaje\nor other crops that improve productivity and allow diversification of productive activities; develop\nawareness and education activities with the communities; and strengthen control, monitoring\nand protection of the forest.\n5 Information elaborated from the Management Declaration of the Conservation Concession TINGANA and from the data\ncollected in the meetings with the community and managers.\n21\n\nPhoto: Ecotourism activity at CC TINGANA\nConservation Concession \u201cBosques de ACOBOSAY\u201d6\nThe Conservation Concession \"Bosques de ACOBOSAY\" has a granted area, according to the\nExecutive Directorial Resolution N\u00b0 089-2017\/GRMS\/ARA\/DEACRN, of 4989 hectares. Located\nin the department of San Martin, province of Moyobamba, district of Moyobamba, populated\ncenters El Alamo, Pampa Hermosa and El Higueron. The altitudinal range of the area varies\nbetween 1,000 and 2,250 meters above sea level. This concession is part of the state-owned\nJuninguillo-Yanyacu Ecosystem Conservation and Recovery Zone (ZoCRE) and is a buffer zone of\nthe Cordillera Escalera RCA, forming part of the Abiseo-C\u00f3ndor-Kutuk\u00fa Conservation Corridor.\nThis concession was granted to the Asociaci\u00f3n de Conservaci\u00f3n de los Bosques del Yanayacu y\nYarau (ACOBOSAY) through the Concession Contract for Conservation Purposes N\u00b022-SAM\/CON-\nCON-2017-001.\nACOBOSAY is a non-profit private law institution established in 2012, which brings together\nagricultural and livestock producers from the El \u00c1lamo, Pampa Hermosa and El Higuer\u00f3n\npopulation groups. Its main area of work is in the Concession, and its mission is to contribute to\nimproving the quality of life of the population, promoting the conservation of biological diversity\nand key ecosystems, encouraging the appropriate use of natural resources. They seek to develop\nconservation activities such as coffee agroforestry systems, ecotourism, orchid nurseries,\nproductive diversification and environmental education.\nThe CC \"Bosques de ACOBOSAY\" is located in the Huayabamba basin, an area that is experiencing\nsignificant conservation challenges due to the migration of people coming from the highlands\nregion of the country in search of land to develop agriculture. This concession is located in the\nYungas montane forest ecosystem, an important habitat for endemic flora and fauna species\n6 Information elaborated from the Management Declaration of the Conservation Concession \u201cBosques de ACOBOSAY\u201d and\nfrom the data collected in the meetings with the community and managers.\n22\n\nsuch as the yellow-tailed choro monkey (Oreonax flavicauda), the Andean spectacled bear\n(Tremarctos ornatus) and the Peruvian cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruviana).\nThe main economic activity in the region is coffee cultivation, which is the livelihood of the\nfamilies surrounding the conservation area. Other secondary activities are pasture farming and\ncattle ranching. The development of a single productive activity (coffee) without technical\nassistance, limited technology and low market prices has caused producers to deforest in order\nto increase the number of plots and generate income. This, coupled with poor control and little\noversight of the concession boundaries, makes forest use unsustainable.\nUnderstanding this context, the project seeks to implement, within the project activities, coffee\nagroforestry systems programs focused on improving productivity, quality, market access and\ngovernance of the coffee association, in order to improve the quality of life of producers and make\na change of land use to a sustainable model that will reduce deforestation of forests in this area.\nThis, together with the diversification of activities, training, educational workshops, research\nactivities, control and surveillance, will allow ACOBOSAY to fulfill its conservation objectives.\nDrone photograph showing the Yunga forest bordering a coffee plots within the CC \"Bosques de\nACOBOSAY\".\nConservation Concession \u201cLos Bosques de la Bella Durmiente\u201d7\nThe Conservation Concession \"Los Bosques de la Bella Durmiente\" has a granted area, according\nto the Executive Directorial Resolution N\u00b0 274-2018\/GRMS\/ARA\/DEACRN, of 2393.45 hectares.\nLocated in Peru, Department of San Martin, Province of Rioja, District of Pardo Miguel, high basin\nof the Mayo River. The population centers within the Concession's zone of influence are Miguel\nGrau, Santa Cruz, and Aguas Claras. The altitudinal range of the zone varies from 1237 meters\n7 Information elaborated from the Management Declaration of the Conservation Concession \u201cLos Bosques de la Bella\nDurmiente\u201d and from the data collected in the meetings with the community and managers.\n23"}]}

REDD has at times been conceived narrowly as simply\na system of conditional performance-based payments (PES)12. Projects developed by Carbon Tanzania\nare similarly premised on performance-based payments, but we have gone further in developing an\napproach to project implementation that recognizes the part that can be played by tried and tested\ninterventions. These include participatory land use mapping, boundary determination, development of land\nuse plans, clarification of tenure, income generating activities, employment and community development.\nFollowing the principles of community-based natural resource management (CBNRM), the key underlying\nassumption of the Wildlife Management Area (WMA) concept is that providing local communities with\neconomic benefits and involving them in the management13 of wildlife resources found in their areas will\npromote both the long-term health of wildlife, protect habitat and create rural economic development.\nCommunities will thus have a vested interest in the conservation of natural resources because they benefit\ndirectly from sustainable management. WMAs were formally adopted as an approach for involving\ncommunities in wildlife management. WMAs can provide local residents with benefits through associated\nenterprises that sustainably utilize either wildlife or other natural resources in the WMA.\nThe Makame Savannah REDD project will protect the Makame WMA from land grabbing and\nencroachment, and the conversion of land from forest to agriculture, thereby stopping deforestation and\npreventing GHG emissions generated through tree harvesting and clearing land for agriculture. In doing so\nthe Masai communities living within the WMA will receive improved land tenue, grazing rights and significant\nincome. This REDD project protects the southern extension of the Tarangire-Manyara ecosystem and in\ndoing so protects significant biodiversity and megafauna, both resident and migratory.\nLocation of the project\nThe project is located in the northern part of the Makame Wildlife Management Area (WMA), Kiteto District,\nnorthern Tanzania. This project area covers 104,065 hectares of Acacia-Commiphora scrub and Woodland,\nand is located 120 km due south of Arusha, Tanzania. The whole WMA is a 364,300 hectare area buffered\nby 102,700 hectares of community land also managed by the same communities. As depicted in Figure\n2.1, this area is under increasing threat from deforestation.\n12 Sills et al. (2009), The evolving landscape of REDD projects.\n13 In this context, management means the communities have the rights to earn income from wildlife\nthough photographic and hunting tourism. The communities do have the right to breed, cull or pen wildlife\nin fenced enclosures.\n8\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3\n\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT : CCB Standards Third Edition\nFigure 2.1.1. Deforestation in and around the project area.\nAn explanation of how the project is expected to generate GHG emission reductions or removals\nOne of the primary project activities is to assist in development, submission and implementation of Makame\nWildlife Management Area\u2019s Resource Management Zone Plan, henceforth referred to as the Resource\nManagement Plan (RMP)(Appendix 5)14. Implementation of the WMA RMP will result in: the conservation\nof natural resources in the area, strengthening of governance in Makame WMA member villages, securing\nof land rights for local communities, and improving the livelihoods of local communities. Each of these\nactions will help to reduce the increasing pressures on the local forest resources - pressures that are\napparent in Figure 2.1 above.\nScenario existing prior to the implementation of the project\nThe without-project scenario involves lack of implementation of the WMA Resource Management Plan\n(WMA RMP). Land tenure, WMA boundaries and land-use planning would continue to be poorly-defined in\nthe baseline without-project scenario. As a result, project area forest lands continue to be at risk of intrusion\nby outsiders and conversion to agriculture.\n14 The Makame WMA Council. 2017.

The cumulative net GHG emission reduction over this same time period is estimated\nto be 1,364,112 tCO2e.\nProject\u2019s climate, community and biodiversity objectives\nThe project\u2019s targets have been broadly defined based on what the community cares most about and what\nits members felt would be critical to achieving the goal of the project. These targets were identified during\na series of community workshops and include aspects related to natural resources as well as to important\nsocial, cultural, economic or religious aspects of the community. Proper management of these assets will\nresult in the sustainable use of the resources that are most critical for long-term community and\nenvironmental health in the Makame WMA.\nMajor climate, community and biodiversity objectives include:\n1. Protect and conserve natural resources in Makame WMA;\n2. Promote sustainable tourism in designated Makame WMA zones;\n3. Improve livelihoods of Makame WMA communities;\n4. Secure land rights for Makame WMA communities;\n5. Protect and maintain the culture and traditions of Makame WMA community members;\n6. Strengthen governance in Makame WMA member villages; and\n7.

At the date of writing this PDD (October 16th 2013) 4'685 ha out of the 8'972 ha\nVCS project area have been demarcated by geometers of the Ministry and titled in favour of the\ncooperative Avotr'Ala. The demarcation of land for the project has been done through consultation of\nthe local population. Accordingly, the protocol of the demarcation was signed by representatives of the\ncommunities (see annex 29). The work of demarcation and titling is ongoing, with the objective of\nfinally securing the 6'073 ha within the VCS eligible project area until the first verification, 5 years after\nproject registration.\nHowever, from a legal point of view, the state remains the owner of the land, but transcribes with\nabove mentioned decision, the rights on land-use to the so-called \u201csuperficiary\u201d. The legal basis for\nthis is in Paragraph 3 of Art. 26 of Low No. 2008.014 (see Annex 27a). The rights associated to this\nfree disposal are further specified in Art. 10 and Art. 12 of Low No. 60.146 and include the right of\nusus, fructus and abusus.\nNo legal text exist at the moment that explicitly specifies the ownership of carbon credits (see R-PP\nMadagascar, Version January 2013) and the right to valorise carbon credits lies within the general\nright of the superficiary to use the fruits of land he manages. Evidence for this can be found in the\nvarious carbon projects that are already registered to voluntary markets through private entities (see\nVCS and CDM Gold Standard registries).\nThe placing of the land at someones disposal is not limited in time and thus no period is mentioned in\nthe letter or the decision. Within Low No. 2008.014 the state preserves the right to regain full\nownership of the rights at any time. However, as the Ministry at the time of signing the letter and the\ndecision was aware of the long-term nature of the project activity, a premature cancellation of the\ncooperative's land-use rights would be against the principle of equity and good faith.\nFinally, with the official disposal of the land for the benefit of the cooperative, the project participants\nhave the right to conduct the planned project activity and to use its fruits, until the state reclaims these\nrights. The Madagascan low does not provide a guarantee with regard of the time period, nor the\ndetailed content of the right (i.e. carbon credits).\nThis is a risk factor for the project that is included in the projects risk assessment (see Project\nLongevity in the AFOLU non-permanence risk assessment in the Annex 28). To assure that the project\narea is still at the disposal of the project participants at time of verification, the following monitoring\nparameter is introduced:\n43\n\n[['Data Unit \/ Parameter:', 'Double-counting'], ['Data unit:', 'boolean'], ['Description:', \"Double-counting of the project's GHG removals\"], ['Source of data:', 'Two options:\\na) proof that the project is registered in a national\\nGHG registry (-> national registry); or\\nb) demonstration that there is no national \/\\nregional carbon accounting system (-> national\\nand regional authorities) and no other land-use\\ncarbon project in direct proximity accounting for\\nthe same removals (-> carbon market registries).'], ['Measurement procedure (if any):', '-'], ['Monitoring frequency:', 'Prior each verification'], ['QA\/QC procedures:', '-'], ['Any comment:', 'In case the same carbon credits are claimed by\\nanother entity (DC = TRUE), no credits shall be\\nissued, or only the credits that are not accounted\\ntwice if there is partial double-counting.']]\nDistribution of carbon credits \/ use of revenues\nAs specified in the convention between EcoFormation and the Avotr'Ala Cooperative and its additional\nclause (see annexes 2 and 3), EcoFormation will have the right to pertain and procure and\ncommercialize carbon credits until the end of the crediting period in 2041. 30% of the net revenues will\ngo to the cooperative and be distributed to its members, according to a previously defined and agreed\ninvestment plan. Another share of maximum 30% (depending on the revenues from timber sales) will\nbe used for financing the project operations (training centre, nurseries, maintenance of plantations, ...).\nThe reminder, i.e. a minimum 40% of the net revenues from carbon markets, remain with\nEcoFormation for the realization of similar projects \/ up-scaling of the activities.\nEmissions Trading Programs and Other Binding Limits\nMadagascar is not involved in any emission trading programs at jurisdictional level until know and no\nhigher-level accounting of emission reductions is done. Preparations for national action plans for\nclimate change mitigation and participation in an international REDD+ scheme are ongoing. However,\nno legal frameworks clarifying roles and rights have been developed so far (see R-PP, Version\nJanuary 2013).\nHowever, it seems from current discussions, that Madagascar will implement kind of a nested\napproach, allowing for co-existence and separate carbon accounting of national programs and\nprojects (VCS Jurisdictional REDD+).\nFor further information see Madagascar's R-PP, version January 2013, available at the FCPF\nhomepage (http:\/\/www.forestcarbonpartnership.org\/madagascar).\nTo ensure, that no double-counting will be done, the following monitoring parameter is introduced:\n44\n\nParticipation under Other GHG Programs\nN\/A\nOther Forms of Environmental Credit\nN\/A\nProjects Rejected by Other GHG Programs\nN\/A"}]}

The project\u2019s aim is to restore\nthe local degraded grassland ecosystem by seeding grass and building fence on the degraded\ngrassland, increase carbon sequestration and contribute to local development by introducing\nsustainable grazing and management of grassland. The project proponent is Yuli Liangshan Green\nIndustryInvestmentCo.,Ltd.\nAccording to the Parameters for Degradation, Sandification and Salification of Rangelands (National\nstandard of China, GB19377-2003) and Project Implementation Plan, moderately degraded areas refer\nto the total grass yield decreased by 21%-50% compared with that before degradation and the total\ngrass yield decreased by 50% compared with that before degradation is regarded as severely\ndegraded grasslands. According to the baseline survey, before the implementation of the project, the\ngrasslandin theproject areawasfacingserious degradation and evendesertificationdue totheimpact\nof climate change and human activities, most of them were moderately degraded while some of them\nevenseverelydegradedforyears.\nTotally, 66,333.33ha of degraded grassland have been managed sustainably by fence building and\nreseeding of local high-quality forage. There are three main restoration measures as followed in the\nproject:\nRotational grazing was implemented in moderately degraded areas. It requires that the grazing time\nshall be halved by dividing grasslands into seasonal grazing land according to the livestock carrying\ncapacity of the grassland by fence building. Then based on specified grazing order, grazing cycle and\nzoning grazing time, the grassland is grazed area by area and used in turn. 58,000 ha of degraded\ngrasslandhavebeenmanagedsustainablybytheimplementationofrotationalgrazing.\nGrazingprohibitionwas implemented in seriously degradedgrasslands. Fencebuilding shall be carried\nout in the grazing prohibition area. When the construction is completed, grazing prohibition shall be\nimplemented for 5 years. After that, under the premise of not affecting the normal growth of the\nimproved grassland, the grassland should be used reasonably and sustainably according to the local\napproved livestock carrying capacity. For the project, totally 6,333.33 ha of degraded grassland have\nbeenmanagedsustainablybygrazingprohibition.\nReseeding grass was implemented in moderately degraded grassland areas. Reseeding grass,\nscientific fertilization and irrigation are carried out to restore grassland vegetation greatly based on\nrodent and pest control on the degraded grassland in the project area. After reseeding the grass, the\nproject area needs to be fenced for 2 years to better restore grassland vegetation. Then under the\npremise of not affecting the normal growth of the improved grassland, the grassland should be used\nreasonably and sustainably according to the local approved livestock carrying capacity.

Six Kebeles were identified to fall within the project site.\nFinally, it was concluded that, frequent meetings and discussions with the local communities including\nillegal settlers in the gulley area should continue in order to reach a consensus. Additionally, it was\nrecommended that relevant offices should be willing to offer any kind of support to the implementing\norganizations.115\niv. Stakeholder consultations with the local communities\nIn an open discussion, community consultation, a consensus was reached to form legal cooperatives in\neach of the six Kebeles to manage the proposed regeneration area and adopt bylaws and internal laws to\nmanage the project. Formation of the cooperatives will make acquisition of the land use right certificates\nfrom the Woreda Rural and Environmental protection offices possible. As such, the communities will be\ngranted user rights and the right to carbon credit sale. ANCEDA, the implementing entity will sign a\nMemorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the cooperatives over the right to carbon credits and other\nrelated activities. Conversely, ANCEDA will sign an agreement with HOAREC&N over the sale of carbon\nright.\nAdditionally, as a result of project expansion in the N-E side, a community consultation was undertaken\nwith the pastoralists who live outside the project site, but utilize the project area as a grazing land for their\ncattle. This was due to their displacement as a result of implementation of the project, as they would lose\ntheir grazing lands and; consequently, their livelihoods which would result in possible leakage problems.\nThe pastoralist community expressed their commitment to tackle any activities that would damage forest\nresources. They agreed to graze their cattle out of the project area utilizing the cut and carry system to\nreduce degradation in the project area. Additionally, they agreed to use crop residue to feed their\nlivestock. Conversely, HOAREC&N agreed to support the pastoralists with fodder and forage seeds to\ngrow in their lands for continued use. Moreover, as a lasting solution, the Zone Livestock and Land\nAdministration offices agreed to teach the community on the importance of having few, high breed cattle\ninstead of many, less productive cattle.\nv. Stakeholder consultations during PRA116\nDuring the PRA, which was conducted between 24 to 28 June 2014, the communities reported some of\nthe activities within the project area that have resulted in the degradation of the forest mountain slopes.\nThese activities included overgrazing, human induced forest fires (started by hunters and grass\ncollectors), unsustainable harvesting of forest resources for personal use and sale and timber for\nconstruction materials.\n115 HOAREC\/N, CDM AR Pre-site Selection Assessment Report, April 2014\n116 Ibid\nv3.2 115\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nThe PRA also revealed that the implementation of the project would result in the displacement of\npastoralists who settle temporarily within the project site during the heavy rainy season (June \u2013\nSeptember) to graze their cattle on the grasslands. The pastoralists would be forced to migrate to other\nnearby places to access grazing lands (including the government grazing land through payment), buy\nfodder and use crop residue from their lands, reduce their livestock numbers, or keep their cattle around\nthe homesteads during summer. Nonetheless, as a lasting solution, the Zone Livestock and Land\nAdministration offices agreed to teach the community on the importance of having few, high breed cattle\ninstead of many, less productive cattle.\nFurthermore, the community presented that, despite these challenges, regeneration of the mountain\nslopes will generate significant environmental benefits including improved air quality, water quality and\nquantity, reduced soil erosion and; hence, improved soil conditions, as well as increased biological\ndiversity. The income generation for local communities will also improve through creation of diversified\nsources of income from honey production, ecotourism, utilization of non-timber forest products, and\nrevenues from carbon finance. This will enhance the livelihoods of these poor, local communities.\nAverting environmental degradation and mitigating climate change impacts will consequently help in\neradicating poverty.117\nvi. Feasibility Study\nA feasibility study was undertaken between 24 June and July 20 2014 by a consultant contracted by\nHOAREC&N. The feasibility study involved an assessment of the potential environmental and socio-\neconomic impacts of the project.\nStakeholder consultations were carried out with the relevant individuals and groups including face-to-face\ninterviews with officials and experts. In addition, two focus group discussions were undertaken with\ncommunity representatives.\nThe focus group discussions established that there has been ongoing degradation of the project site as a\nconsequence of anthropogenic activities. The main drivers of deforestation established included firewood\ncollection; overgrazing and agricultural activities. The agents of deforestation included members of local\ncommunities. The degradation of the mountain forests has resulted in recurrent drought, soil degradation,\nshortage of livestock feed, declining crop\/livestock productivity, as well as water shortages in the local\ncommunities.\nIn addition, the consultant provided that, there is an opportunity to enhance water availability as well as\necosystem regeneration through reducing vegetation and unsustainable land use practices in the area.\nAs a consequence, various mitigation measures were proposed for this project which included\nafforestation of degraded forest areas, introduction and popularization of improved cooking mechanisms,\nas well as improved agroforestry technologies.\nThe stakeholder consultations also revealed that, there are risks and threats that may hamper the\nsuccess of the project, for instance, the prevalent degradation of the soil and poor soil condition as a\nresult of poor soil fertility and depth. Another major challenge established was finding an alternative\ngrazing ground for the large livestock population in the area since this could hamper regeneration of\nvegetation through grazing and trampling effects. Other challenges included management failures and\nfinancial failures. Furthermore, due to the substantial dependence of the local communities to the\nmountain forests, they suggested several livelihood options to reduce pressure on the forest. These\n117 HOAREC&N, Socio-economic Baseline Inventory of the Jama and Urji Restoration Project in Ethiopia,\n2014\nv3.2 116\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nencompassed beekeeping, ecotourism, poultry farming, fishery, use of energy efficient cook stoves, and\nutilization of the cut and carry system for their livestock.\nThe major stakeholders identified were farmers who are organized in Community Forest Management\nGroups (CFMGs) aimed at enhancing the rehabilitation and enrichment of the project sites. However, it\nwas noted that, the project presents opportunities for disputes as a result of excluding farmers who are\nnot members of the CFMGs and; consequently have no forest rights of use.\nOn the management practices, it was found that, there have been limited interventions to rehabilitate the\nforest areas, but since the inception of the project, community mobilization for integrated watershed\nmanagement and awareness creation have been the main intervention focus areas for the last three\nyears. Due to this, it was observed that there has been natural regeneration of many species in the\nproject areas due to community attitudinal change.\nv3.2 117\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nAPPENDIX 1: BASELINE BIOMASS SURVEY\nThe first goal of the baseline biomass survey is to define the land that is eligible for an ARR project, i.e.\nareas classified as non-forest. A Land Use Land Cover (LULC) map has been generated from satellite\ninformation available.\nThe second target is to determine the baseline carbon stocks in the Instance Area (eligible areas) within\nthe Instance Zone, which are necessary in order to define the starting point from the carbon stocks\nperspective. Since VHR satellite imagery was available for a period close to the start date, this has been\nused to estimate the crown cover which in turn has been used to determine the baseline carbon stock\nthrough the application of the techniques prescribed in the applicable tool.\nThe same points will be interpreted for trees and shrubs, therefore giving an estimate of proportion of\npoints in each clusters that overlay on trees or shrubs. It is not expected that a point will overlay on both\ntrees and shrubs.\nHereunder an example of a cluster and of interpretation. In yellow those points where a Shrub was\ndetected, in blue those points with bareland or grassland. No trees were identified.\nFigure 17.

Purpose and general description of project activity\n>>\nPurpose of the project activity\nThe project activity under consideration involves renewable energy generation from six numbers of Wind\nTurbine Generators (WTGs) with total installed capacity of 9 Mega-Watt (MW) (1.5 MW X 6) promoted\nby Khatau Narbheram & Co. The net electricity generated by the WTGs is supplied to the Southern\nRegional Electricity Grid of India1 through the nearest grid sub-station. There is no wheeling\narrangement of the electricity generated by the project promoter.\nPre-Project Scenario:\nThe project is a Greenfield power generation project where no renewable power had been generated prior\nto the project activity. Also there was no other kind of occupancy in terms of any other industrial project,\ndwelling of local people at the project site etc. The project activity has been commissioned on unused\nland where there was no need to demolish any existing structure. Hence, in the pre-project scenario there\nwas barren unoccupied land where the WTGs stand now.\nBaseline Scenario:\nconnected\nproject\nelectricity\nThe estimated annual average GHG emission reductions because of project activity are estimated to\nabout 17,679 tCO per year. The fixed crediting period of 10 years has been chosen for the project 2\nactivity. The total number of GHG emission reductions over the crediting period is estimated to be about\n176,790 tCO . 2\nContribution to GHG emissions reduction\nThe project activity harnesses wind energy to generate and supply electricity to the southern regional\nelectricity grid of India. The Project displaces fossil fuel based electricity generation that would have\notherwise been provided by the operation and expansion of the fossil fuel based power plants in southern\nregion electricity grid, thereby leading to reduction in emission of greenhouse gases associated with\nfossil fuel based electricity generation.\nContribution to sustainable development\nThe project activity contributes towards sustainable development of the host country and the state of\nTamil Nadu by reducing the dependency on fossil fuel dominated based electricity generation, which\n1The Indian power grid system (or the National Grid) is divided into two regional grids namely NEWNE Regional Grid and\nSouthern Regional Grid. These regional grids have independent state Load Dispatch Centres (LDCs) that manage flow of power\nin their jurisdiction.\n\nUNFCCC\/CCNUCC\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board Page 3\nultimately leads to reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The project also fulfills several other\nsustainable development objectives as illustrated below:\nSocial well-being:\n\uf0b7 The social well-being is assessed by the contribution of the project activity towards improvement\nin the living standards of the local community. Project activities like wind power generation\nprovides job opportunities to the local population thus contributing towards social upliftment of\nthe local community. This project activity has also led to the development of basic amenities\nleading to improvement in living standards of the local population. Thus the project activity has\ncontributed to social well-being.\nEconomic well-being:\n\uf0b7 Wind farms need large area. Thus, the procurement of land by the various project promoters, has\nled to the appreciation of land value benefiting the landowners and local community directly.\nThese lands were generally unproductive. Most of the wind energy potential areas are remotely\nlocated areas and are largely unfertile. These lands generally command low prices. But due to the\nland demand for wind farms, the land prices have increased leading to economic well-being of\nthe local community.\n\uf0b7 The project activity has created direct and indirect job opportunities to the local community\nduring installation and operation of the WEGs. The investment for the project activity has\nincreased the economic activity of the local area. The above have contributed to the economic\nwell-being and social well-being of the local community.\nEnvironmental well-being:\n\uf0b7 The project activity produces electricity without any greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\nAdditionally, the project activity generates electricity from a \u2018renewable energy source\u2019. The\nrenewable energy source is generally defined as a source of energy that gets replenished naturally\nand does not suffer permanent depletion due to use.\nTechnological well-being:\n\uf0b7 Advent of wind power projects in India will further enhance research and development (R&D)\nefforts by technology providers to develop more efficient and better machinery in future.\n\uf0b7 Overall technological well-being and development of the emission-free energy sector"}]}

To ensure environmental integrity, the project employs a meticulous process to identify\nand exclude wetlands, marshy soils, and swamps from its scope of activities. This approach\nguarantees that the project does not interfere with wetland ecosystems. Further validation is\nprovided through geospatial analysis, which overlays the project zones onto soil classifications.\nThis analysis confirms that the targeted areas are not wetlands or wet soils (Gleysols) or organic\nsoils (Histosols) but are primarily composed of Luvisols and Acrisols as can be seen in Figure 13\nFigure 13 Soils present in the project area\n48\n\n[['Tool', 'Applicability conditions', 'Justifications'], ['\u201cCombined tool to identify\\nthe baseline scenario and\\ndemonstrate additionality\\nin A\/R CDM project\\nactivities\u201d (Version 01)', 'a) Forestation of the land within the\\nproposed project boundary performed with\\nor without being registered as the A\/R CDM\\nproject activity shall not lead to violation of\\nany applicable law even if the law is not\\nenforced\\nb) This tool is not applicable to small-scale\\nafforestation and reforestation project\\nactivities.', 'a) The project technology\\npackages do not violate any\\nlaws of India.

As a result, the limitations concerning soil disturbance\nare not applicable to this project. In general, in this project, soil disturbance is only associated\nwith digging the planting pits and spot-hoeing (manual weeding around the planted trees\/\nplanting pit\/ hole) which is estimated at most to be 3% of the total area. This is derived if one\nassumes universal plant spacing of 3 m x 3 m (as in the planting scheme in Figure 4), with a pit\nof width of 1 foot radius (see Figure 16), which is used for planting and spot-hoeing.

Although the project proponent has been carrying out tree-planting\nactivities in townships in South Africa for a number of years, the appropriate monitoring\nand management procedures to ensure long-term viability of the project and appropriate\ncarbon stock accounting have only been developed through this PD. As a result, previous\ntree planting activities cannot be included in the project. The sale of carbon credits will\nallow a significant expansion of operations that could not otherwise be undertaken.\nThe project crediting period is set as 40 years. This period has been chosen based on the\ntime taken for the planted trees to reach maturity. Although some of the trees will die\nprior to the end of the crediting period, and others are longer-lived than the 40 years,\nthe chosen crediting period allows for the bulk of the trees to reach maturity maximising\nthe carbon sequestered by the project activity instance. An annual mortality rate has\nbeen included accounting for the trees not expected to live to 40 years. The commitment\nperiod allows for long-term monitoring and assessment, which ensures the security of\nthe carbon credits for the clients thereby making them a more valuable investment. The\nproject proponent is certain that sufficient land will be available and interest and funding\ngenerated to ensure that the project can operate over this timescale."}]}

The Project is connected to the Enercon (India) Limited (EIL) substation (to be owned\nby MSETCL) at Village Mehekari (near 33kV Mehekari S\/S), Ahmednagar district. The Project\nactivity is located at a distance of 120 km from Pune by road. The nearest big railway station is at\nPune.\nThe details of the physical location of the project activity are presented in Annexure 01\n1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation\nThe Project activity is exporting power to the Western Regional Electricity Grid (part of NEWNE\nGrid) which is dominated by fossil fuel fired thermal power stations. The grid is also experiencing\npower deficit and hence the addition of wind energy generation is helping in avoiding excessive\nGHG emissions by supplying similar amount of power from other grid connected power plants\nand meeting the requirement of power demand.\nThe electricity generated from the Project activity is getting sold to the Maharashtra State\nElectricity Distribution Co. Ltd. (MSEDCL) under a long term power purchase agreement. The\nwind power project generates electricity and will replace the electricity that would otherwise have\nbeen generated by other grid connected power stations and by addition of new generating\nstations.\nIndia has two regional grids i.e. NEWNE (North, Eastern, Western and North-Eastern) grid and\nSouthern grid. The Project is connected to Western Regional Electricity Grid of the NEWNE Grid\nand hence the baseline for the Project activity will be emissions that would have occurred by the\noperation of grid connected power stations and by the addition of new generating stations in\nNEWNE Grid.\nThe project activity is a renewable power generation facility which does not emit any kind of GHG\nemissions. Hence the project activity has not been implemented to create GHG emissions for the\npurpose of the subsequent removal or destruction of GHG emissions.\nv3.0 5"}]}

All the\ncommunity-focused activities which the project plans to implement were identified during SIA\ncommunity workshops described earlier (see Section 2.2.1). Most of these are designed to help create\ngreater awareness, capacity and financial security in the communities, reducing the need to undertake\nunsustainable resource extraction from the Project Area. They include:\n1. Direct employment, and job creation through alternative income-generating activities\n2. Participatory land-use planning: will lay the basis for land demarcation and land tenure security\n3. Strengthening community organizations for management of natural resources\n4. Community based eco-tourism initiatives\n5. Stimulating investment and micro-credit (microfinance) schemes\n48\n\n[['Impact #1', '', 'All members of the project zone communities will have access to', ''], [None, None, 'micro-finance loans and will have secure land tenure.', None]]\nProject Description: SD VISta Version 1\n6. Sensitization and awareness raising\n7. Enhanced security and law enforcement\n8. Health improvement through employment of medical staff or provision of supplies\n9. Education improvement through employment of teachers, bursary schemes, and infrastructure\n10. Improvement and intensification of agriculture including training and market access.\nTheory of Change Statements\nBased on the extensive experience of the Project partner WA in working on biodiversity conservation\nand community projects in the SCRP landscape, a literature review, and from information obtained from\nthe SIA workshops held, we applied the theory of change approach to justify our project rationale and\nto produce indicators for the CCB monitoring plan. The theory of change is a hypothesis about how a\nproject intends to achieve its stated objectives, or a roadmap of how it plans to get from project\nactivities to project impacts (Richards & Panfil, 2011). As such, we developed a theory of change for\neach of the three Focal Issues (see details in the Result Chains under Section 2.1.9).\nThe assumptions we make about the cause-and-effect relationships were made explicit in the Result\nChain diagrams developed by community members during the SIA workshops, from which the theories\nof change statements are based. Indicators were developed for key results and assumptions;\nmonitoring of assumptions was included to enable us identify points of deviation early enough. In other\nwords, the indicators outlined in the Monitoring Plan (see 3.3) will enable measuring progress towards\nachieving the desired project activity outcomes and impacts from project activities and strategies.\n\u2022 Focal Issue 1: Poor Community Livelihoods: IF there are adequate and functional health\nfacilities, IF education is improved through better facilities and access through bursary\nschemes, and IF there is improved food security from sustainable intensified agriculture, THEN\nthe communities will have higher incomes and improved livelihoods.\n\u2022 Focal Issue 2: Forest Destruction and Land Encroachment: IF participatory land use planning is\nconducted and land tenure security strengthened, IF immigration and land allocations are\nstrictly controlled, and IF the Community Protected Area (CPA) is developed following proper\nprocesses, THEN land grabbing, illegal logging and NTFP collection will be strictly controlled\nand the forest well preserved.\n\u2022 Focal Issue 3: Wildlife Poaching: IF community-based eco-tourism is developed, IF the\nsensitization and awareness-raising is conducted among communities around the project area,\nand IF security and law enforcement are strengthened, THEN the both poaching and demand\nin wildlife and bush-meat will decline as will habitat loss, thereby leading to improved wildlife\npopulations in the SCRP.\n49\n\n[['', 'Type of Impact', '', 'This is a positive impact, that is actual and direct', None, None], ['', 'Affected', '', 'Community in general \u2013 present and future', None, None], [None, 'Stakeholder', None, None, None, None], [None, 'Group(s)', None, None, None, None], ['Resulting Change\\nin Well-being', None, None, '', 'The Project has utilized a revolving micro-finance fund and family', ''], [None, None, None, None, 'savings system to support access to capital and markets.

Employment\nhas also been generated by setting up of monitoring teams for the local\nskilled people simultaneously.\n4. The project generates clean power. Consequently, no emissions result\nfrom the project, thus helping to protect the environment from harmful\nemissions (such as SO , NO etc.), as well as prevent greenhouse gas 2 x\nemissions altogether.\n\nVCS Project Description Template"}]}

No', '', 'Source of electricity', '', '', 'Percentage Share based on', ''], [None, None, 'generation', None, None, 'installed capacity (MW)', None], ['1', 'Coal', None, None, '55.13 %', None, None], ['2', 'Diesel', None, None, '0.97 %', None, None], ['3', 'Hydro', None, None, '26.01 %', None, None], ['4', 'Nuclear', None, None, '2.70 %', None, None], ['5', 'RES (MNRE)**', None, None, '4.98 %', None, None], ['6', 'Natural Gas', None, None, '10.21 %', None, None]]\nVCS Project Description\ngeneration and distribution system, i.e. the NEWNE Regional Electricity Grid of India. In the\nprocess, an equivalent quantum of electricity that would have been generated by the grid in\nline with the grid electricity generation mix is displaced by the project activity. The carbon\nintensity of the fossil-fuel dominated generation mix of the grid is evident from the following\nbreak-up of various types of energy sources constituting the grid-mix contributing electricity\nto the NEWNE Grid system as shown in the table (as on Mar 2006). It is evident from the\nbelow table that a major share of about 55% of the total electricity generation is constitute by\ncoal (fossil fuel) which would have been the most plausible choice for the project proponent\nto opt for.\nTable 8: Energy Mix in India year 2005-06\n(3Source: CEA report, power scenario; Renewable Energy Sources (RES) includes SHP, BG,\nBP, U &I, and wind energy; (**) Based on data as on Mar 2006 as furnished by MNRE.)\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n2. \u201cIf the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a\nwind\/diesel unit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small-scale CDM project activity applies\nonly to the renewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel, the capacity of the\nentire unit shall not exceed the limit of 15MW\u201d.\nThe project activity involves only wind power generation. The gross wind power generation\ncapacity of the bundled project activity is 13.75 MW, which is less than the eligibility limit of\n15 MW, as stipulated in the applicability criterion under consideration. Hence the project\nactivity complies with this criterion.\n3. \u201cCombined heat and power (co-generation) systems are not eligible under this\ncategory\u201d\nThe project activity involves generation of electricity only through WTGs and is not a co-\ngeneration system. Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n4. \u201cIn the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy\ngeneration units at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added capacity of the\nunits added by the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be physically distinct\nfrom the existing units.\u201d\nThe project activity does not involve the addition of renewable energy generation units at an\nexisting renewable power generation facility. Hence the project activity complies with this\ncriterion.\n3 http:\/\/www.cea.nic.in\/power_sec_reports\/Executive_Summary\/2007_01\/8.pdf\n17\n\nVCS Project Description\n5. \u201cProject activities that seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for renewable\nenergy generation are included in this category. To qualify as a small scale project, the total\noutput of the modified or retrofitted unit shall not exceed the limit of 15 MW\u201d\nThe renewable energy generating wind-farms employed by the project activity are newly\nconstructed set up and does not involve retrofitting or modification of any existing facility for\nrenewable energy generation. Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.\nThus, the project activity fulfills all the applicability criteria of the simplified small scale\nmethodology AMS-I.D.\/ Version 14."}]}

The applicability of these tools has been discussed below:\nApplicability of \u201cTool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality\u201d v 07.0.0:\nThe tool for demonstration and assessment of additionality provides a general framework demonstrating and\nassessing additionality and is applicable to a wide range of project types. As referred in ACM0002, the\nadditionality tool is applicable for the proposed project activity.\nApplicability of \u201cTool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system\u201d v 03.0.0:\nThis methodological tool determines the CO emission factor for displacement of electricity generated by 2\npower plants in an electricity system, by calculating the \u201ccombined margin\u201d emission factor (CM) of the\nelectricity system. This tool may be applied to estimate the Operating Margin, Build Margin and\/or CM when\ncalculating baseline emissions for a project activity that substitutes grid electricity. As the proposed project\nactivity supplies electricity to the national grid, the \u201cTool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity\nsystem\u201d v 03.0.0 is applicable to the project activity.\n15 The topographical map presenting the surface area of the reservoir is presented to the DOE.

This area is at the interface of the Boreal Shield Ecozone and the Boreal Plain Ecozone, with\ncharacteristics and ecoregions of both.\nThe Boreal Shield Ecozone is the area where the Canadian Shield and the boreal forest overlap.\nStretching 3,800 kilometres from Newfoundland to Alberta, the Boreal Shield includes parts of 6\nprovinces, covers more than 1.8 million square kilometres, and encompasses almost 20% of Canada's\nland mass and 10% of its fresh water. Some of Canada\u2019s largest rivers have their headwaters in the\nBoreal Shield, including the Nelson, Churchill, Rupert and St. Lawrence.\n12\n\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.3\nThe Boreal Plains Ecozone is part of the flat Interior Plains of Canada, a northern extension of the Great\nPlains of North America. The subdued relief consists of low-lying valleys and plains stretching across the\nmid portions of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. It covers 650,000 square kilometres and the\nmajority of the surface waters are part of three watersheds: those of the Saskatchewan River, the Beaver\nRiver, and Peace, Athabasca, and Slave rivers' watershed.\nChurchill River Upland Ecoregion, Boreal Shield Ecozone\nThe Churchill River Upland Ecoregion is part of the Boreal Shield Ecozone, as shown in Figure 1. This\necoregion is located along the southern edge of the Precambrian Shield in north-central Saskatchewan\nand Manitoba. It is marked by cool summers and very cold winters. The mean annual temperature is\napproximately -2.5\u00b0C. The mean summer temperature is 12.5\u00b0C and the mean winter temperature is -\n18.5\u00b0C. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 400-500 mm. It is classified as having a subhumid\nhigh boreal ecoclimate.\nThis ecoregion forms part of the continuous coniferous boreal forest that extends from northwestern\nOntario to Great Slave Lake in the southern Northwest Territories. The predominant vegetation consists\nof closed stands of black spruce and jack pine with a shrub layer of ericaceous shrubs and a ground\ncover of mosses and lichens. Black spruce is the climatic climax species. Depending on drainage, surficial\nmaterial and local climate, trembling aspen, white birch, white spruce, and to a lesser extent balsam fir,\noccupy significant areas, especially in the eastern section. Bedrock exposures have fewer trees and are\ncovered with lichens. Closed to open stands of stunted black spruce with ericaceous shrubs and a ground\ncover of sphagnum moss dominate poorly drained peat-filled depressions.\nPermafrost is distributed throughout the ecoregion, but is only widespread in organic deposits. Although\nlocal relief rarely exceeds 25 m, ridged to hummocky, massive Archean rocks form steeply sloping\nuplands and lowlands. Small to large lakes compose 30-40% of the ecoregion and drain northeastward\nvia the Churchill, Nelson and Seal river systems. In the western part of the ecoregion, uplands are covered\nwith discontinuous sandy acidic tills, whereas extensive thin clayey lacustrine deposits and locally\nprominent, sandy fluvioglacial uplands are common in the eastern section. Exposed bedrock occurs\nthroughout the ecoregion and is locally prominent. Dystric and Eutric Brunisols are associated with sandy\nuplands, whereas Gray Luvisols occur on clayey lacustrine uplands and loamy to silty fluvioglacial\ndeposits. On level and in depressional areas, Gleysolic soils are associated with clayey sediments,\nwhereas Mesisols and Organic Cryosols are associated with shallow to deep peatlands.\nWildlife includes barren-ground caribou, moose, black bear, lynx, wolf, beaver, muskrat, snowshoe hare\nand red-backed vole. Bird species include raven, common loon, spruce grouse, bald eagle, gray jay, hawk\nowl, and waterfowl, including ducks and geese.\n13\n\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.3\n10\nFigure 1 Churchill River Upland Ecoregion\nMid-Boreal Lowland Ecoregion, Boreal Plain Ecozone\nThe Mid-Boreal Lowland Ecoregion is part of the Boreal Plains Ecozone, as shown in Figure 2. This\necoregion occupies the northern section of the Manitoba Plain from the eastern shore of Lake Winnipeg\nto the Cumberland Lowlands in Saskatchewan. The climate is marked by short, warm summers and cold\nwinters. The mean annual temperature is approximately -1\u00b0C. The mean summer temperature is 13.5\u00b0C\nand the mean winter temperature is -17\u00b0C. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 375 mm in the\nnorthwest to 625 mm in the southeast. It is classified as having a subhumid mid-boreal ecoclimate.\n10 https:\/\/biolwww.usask.ca\/rareplants_sk\/root\/htm\/en\/researcher\/4_ecoreg.php\n14\n\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.3\nThis ecoregion is part of the boreal mixed coniferous and deciduous forest, extending from Lac Seul in\nnorthwestern Ontario to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. It is a relatively flat, low-lying region with\nextensive wetlands covering approximately half the area. The cold and poorly drained fens and bogs are\ncovered with tamarack and black spruce. The mixed deciduous and coniferous forest is characterized by\nmedium to tall, closed stands of trembling aspen and balsam poplar with white and black spruce, and\nbalsam fir occurring in late successional stages.\nPermafrost occurs in isolated patches in peatlands and is more prevalent in the regions northeastern\nsection. Underlain by flat-lying, Palaeozoic limestone bedrock, the ecoregion is covered almost entirely\nby level to ridged glacial till, lacustrine silts and clays, and extensive peat deposits. Eutric Brunisols\ndeveloped on extremely calcareous, loamy glacial till and Mesisols on forest peat are codominant and\nare associated with local areas of limestone bedrock outcroppings and Gray Luvisols on loamy to clayey-\ntextured lacustrine deposits.\nWildlife includes moose, black bear, wolf, lynx, showshoe hare, waterfowl (including duck, goose, pelican,\nand sandhill crane), ruffed grouse, and other birds.\n15\n\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.3\n11\nFigure 2 Mid-Boreal Lowland Ecoregion\nMid-Boreal Uplands Ecoregion, Boreal Plain Ecozone\nThe Mid-Boreal Uplands Ecoregion is part of the Boreal Plains Ecozone, as shown in Figure 3. This mid-\nboreal ecoregion occurs as 10 separate, mostly upland areas, south of the Canadian Shield, stretching\nfrom north-central Alberta to southwestern Manitoba. It includes several prominent uplands known locally\nas the Thickwood, Pasquia, and Porcupine hills in Saskatchewan. The climate has predominantly short,\ncool summers and cold winters. The mean annual temperature ranges from -1\u00b0C to 1\u00b0C. The mean\nsummer temperature ranges from 13\u00b0C to 15.5\u00b0C and the mean winter temperature ranges from -\n11 https:\/\/biolwww.usask.ca\/rareplants_sk\/root\/htm\/en\/researcher\/4_ecoreg.php\n16\n\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.3\n13.5\u00b0C to -16\u00b0C. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 400-550 mm. It is classified as having a\npredominantly subhumid mid-boreal ecoclimate.\nThese uplands form part of the continuous mid-boreal mixed coniferous and deciduous forest extending\nfrom northwestern Ontario to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Medium to tall, closed stands of\ntrembling aspen and balsam poplar with white and black spruce, and balsam fir occurring in late\nsuccessional stages, are most abundant. Deciduous stands have a diverse understory of shrubs and\nherbs; coniferous stands tend to promote feathermoss. Cold and poorly drained fens and bogs are\ncovered with tamarack and black spruce. Consisting for the most part of Cretaceous shales, these\nuplands are covered entirely by kettled to dissected, deep, loamy to clayey-textured glacial till, lacustrine\ndeposits, and inclusions of coarse, fluvioglacial deposits. Elevations range from about 400 to over 800\nm asl. Associated with rougher morainal deposits are a large number of small lakes, ponds, and sloughs\noccupying shallow depressions.\nPermafrost is very rare and found only in peatlands. Well-drained Gray Luvisolic soils are dominant in the\nregion. Significant inclusions are peaty-phase Gleysols and Mesisols that occupy poorly drained\ndepressions. Dystric Brunisols occur on droughty, sandy sites. In most of Saskatchewan the uplands slope\ngently and drain northeastward via the Churchill and North Saskatchewan river systems.\nCharacteristic wildlife includes moose, white-tailed deer, elk, black bear, timber wolf, lynx, snowshoe\nhare, beaver, and muskrat. Bird species include common loon, red-tailed hawk and neotropical\nmigrants.\n17\n\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.3\n12\nFigure 3 Mid-Boreal Uplands Ecoregion\nThe initial project instances being brought forward are under the following communities:\n\u2022 Sturgeon Landing (Fur Block N-86), Figure 4\n\u2022 Denare Beach (Fur Block N-31), Figure 5\n\u2022 Pelican Narrows Phase 113 (Fur Block N-32), Figure 6\n12 https:\/\/biolwww.usask.ca\/rareplants_sk\/root\/htm\/en\/researcher\/4_ecoreg.php\n13 It is anticipated that Pelican Narrows will enroll additional project instances as part of the larger PBCN grouped project.\n18\n\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.3\nThe following Figures provide boundaries of the individual project instances within the Mee-Toos TSL\narea.\nFigure 4 Sturgeon Landing Forest Carbon Project Area\n19\n\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.3\nFigure 5 Denare Beach Forest Carbon Project Area\nFigure 6 Pelican Narrows (Phase 1) Forest Carbon Project Area\n20\n\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.3"}]}

The geodetic points of South Africa i.e. the grouped project\nboundary are shown in Table 1. A more detailed boundary is saved in and available in an\nappropriate digital Geographic Information Systems (GIS) format (KML 2.2 and ESRI\nshapefiles). The project proponent has access to in excess of 36,000 ha of eligible land\nat present and is continually offered community land to undertake planting. Once the\nsuccess of the project is demonstrated, it is likely that communities will make further\nland available for bamboo planting as part of the project i.e. the availability of land will\nnot be a limiting factor. Whilst this land is available, communities lack the financial\nresources to make the land productive.\nInitial project activities will focus on an identified project site (Plot number RE\/9\/308-IQ\nElandsfontein) adjacent to the Lawley Township, West Rand, Gauteng Province, South\nAfrica (see Figures 1 and 2). Lawley Township consists of a mixture of Reconstruction\nand Development Programme (RDP)5 housing and shacks. The township and surrounding\n4 Brightfields Natural Trading Company.

Employment opportunities are limited and unemployment is estimated at\n50 % of the residents. An area of 101 ha has been made available to the BFA\nProgramme. This area is administered by the Blue Disa religious based Non-Government\nOrganization (NGO) that currently runs a feeding scheme for aids orphans and\nabandoned children from the township. The land was allocated to the Blue Disa NGO in\n2010 by the Mahatammoho Agricultural Co-operative (MAC) on a long-term (21 year)\nrenewable lease. MAC acquired the land through a development agreement with the\nGauteng Department of Public Transport, Roads and Works (GDPTRW) in 2007. Prior to\nthe GDPTRW buying the land, a small-scale dairy operation was run by a farmer.\nAssociated with the dairy farm were farm buildings and outer structures. After the\nfarmer vacated the land, the buildings were occupied illegally. These illegal occupants\nhave since been relocated to adjacent townships through a formal housing settlement\nprocess and the informal structures have largely been removed (see Figure 3). The\nproject proponent has a development agreement with the Blue Disa NGO for the project\n(see Annex 2 for: i) the development agreement between project proponent and Blue\nDisa NGO; and ii) the long-term lease agreement between Blue Disa NGO and MAC).\nWhile the land was originally used for agricultural purposes (as was almost all land in\nSouth Africa), it is not presently zoned as \u201eagricultural\u201f (see Figure 4). The zoning as per\nthe City of Johannesburg Regional Spatial Development Framework (SDF) is\n\u201eundetermined\u201f. This was confirmed with the City of Johannesburg Department of\nDevelopment Planning and Urban Management: Corporate Geo-Informatics Division, and\nis characteristic for land earmarked for urban development.\nThe instance is delineated by a bounding box (maximum North, South, East and West\ncoordinates; Table 1). A more specific project site boundary is saved in a GIS format\n(KML 2.2 and ESRI shapefiles). This delineated boundary is the perimeter of the\nplantation within which all initial and future sponsored bamboo planting for carbon\noffsetting (instances of the project activity) for the project site will occur. The project\nsite will be planted in blocks as funding becomes available. To accommodate this, ex\npost calculations of carbon accumulation will be stratified by age (see Section 3.4). The\narea within the project site boundary meets the site eligibility criteria in Section 1.16.\nAdditional project sites will be added to the grouped project through the crediting period.\nThis is a practice endorsed by the VCS grouped project methodology. These additional\nproject sites will meet these eligibility criteria listed in Section 1.16 and will be validated\nand formally incorporated into the grouped project during each verification period. The\nboundaries will be set and saved as described above. In keeping with the guidelines\nspecified by the selected methodology, where sites are within 1 km of each other they\nwill be managed and monitored as a single site6. In such instances project emission\nreductions will be within the 16,000 tonnes CO e per annum limit per project site set by 2\nthe methodology7.\nTable 1: Bounding coordinates and size of the project area and identified\nproject site.\naim of the RDP is to provide formal housing nationwide with basic infrastructure, such as electricity, sanitation\nand running water.\n6 UNFCCC EB54 Annex 13.

The unit also has a powerhouse and pipeline leading the\nwater to the turbine where the electricity is generated.\nThe water is diverted immediately at the Maitenes tunnel exit. The water is driven through the adduction\nchannel, to a penstock that leads the water to the powerhouse, which houses a Kaplan turbine and the\nassociated generation equipment. The water is returned to the Sanatorio brook through a return channel.\nThere will be one (1) substation with a transformer that elevates the tension up to 66 kV for the project\nactivity. Then, the electricity will be transmitted through a 7.2 km transmission line to Chiburgo\nSubstation.\nThe specific characteristic of the hydropower unit are shown in the following table:\n3 Nominal power guaranteed by the manufacturer. According to Colb\u00fan experience, this kind of turbines could work\nwith an overload of around 10%, which will be tested since the second year of operation. This margin corresponds\nto a security criteria of the manufacturer in cases where the turbine operates at its maximum flow. Achieving this\noverload is a very unlikely scenario, and in case of occurring, it would be only in isolated situations in the months of\nJanuary and December. Furthermore, the operation of the unit will not rely on this extra power output in order to\navoid any overload and equipment failure risk, so the project design and evaluation spreadsheets do not consider it.\n7\n\n[['Intake', '- Nominal flow: 17 m3\/s\\n- Revetment: concrete\\n- Level at the exit of the tunnel: 358.55m.a.s.l.'], ['Adduction\\nchannel', '- Total Length: 1.656km.\\n- Section: trapezoidal type.\\n- Base width: 2.7 m and Height: 3.30 m.\\n- Channel slope: 0.03%.'], ['Forebay tank', '- Length: 35 m, Wide: 3.7m and Depth: 3.65-9.40 m.'], ['Penstock', '- Number of pipes: one\\n- Material: steel\\n- Total Length: 78.16 m\\n- Diameter: 2.2 m'], ['Power house', '- Length: 16.5 m, Wide: 15.35 m\\n- Equipment: turbine, safety valve and generator.\\nTurbine Generator\\nType: Kaplan CAT Axis: Vertical\\nAxis: Vertical Capacity: 5,985 kW\\nNominal flow: 17 m3\/s Apparent capacity 6,300kVA\\nNominal capacity: 5.5 MW (*) Frequency 50 Hz\\nNet height of fall: 35.5 meters Voltage: 6,600 kV\\nSpeed 428.6 rpm\\n(*) During the different stages of the project (basic engineer, detailed engineer, request of\\nenvironmental approval) there were minor modifications in the installed capacity. 5.5 MW\\ncorresponds to the definitive nominal value.'], ['Discharge\\nchannel', '- Length: 354.3m, Wide: 3.2m and High: 3.8m\\n- Section: drawer type\\n- Revetment: concrete.\\n- Channel slope: 0.01%.'], ['Other\\nfacilities', '- Discharge to evacuate in an emergency only the water from headrace\\nchamber.\\n- Local dump: 26 m length\\n- Collector channel (wide: 2.5 m, slope: 0.5% and length: 26 m).\\n- Rapid discharge (length: 127.3 m and wide: 2.5 m).']]\n[['Adduction'], ['channel']]\n[['Turbine', 'Generator'], ['Type: Kaplan CAT\\nAxis: Vertical\\nNominal flow: 17 m3\/s\\nNominal capacity: 5.5 MW (*)\\nNet height of fall: 35.5 meters', 'Axis: Vertical\\nCapacity: 5,985 kW\\nApparent capacity 6,300kVA\\nFrequency 50 Hz\\nVoltage: 6,600 kV\\nSpeed 428.6 rpm']]\n[['Discharge'], ['channel']]\n[['Other'], ['facilities']]\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-PDD) - Version 03\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board\nTable 2: Technical characteristics of the project activity\nm3\/s\nSource: \"Central Hidroel\u00e9ctrica San Clemente Readecuaci\u00f3n de Ingenier\u00eda B\u00e1sica.

Description of how the anthropogenic emissions of GHG by sources are reduced below\nthose that would have occurred in the absence of the registered small-scale CDM project activity:\nAs per the Electricity Act 2003, any entity may install power plant on its own. Also, the central\ngovernment and various state governments have come with renewable energy policies to promote\nrenewable energy technologies.\n\u2022 Electricity generation from wind farm is not a legal requirement or a mandatory choice. There\nare states and sectoral policies which are primarily framed to encourage wind based power\nproject to attract more private investment as there are many anticipated risks under the project\nand requires good amount of equity to be involved.\n\u2022 The Indian Electricity Act of 2003 does not restrict or empower any authority to restrict the fuel\nchoice for power generation. In addition, it may be noted that the draft National Electricity\nPolicy (revised in August 2004) asserts \u2018coal would necessarily continue to remain the major\nfuel\u2019.\nGovernment of India plans to generate at least 10% of the total power generation through\nrenewable sources of power by 2010 and provides a number of benefits to these projects through\nits ministries\/departments, in spite of which, the projects face barriers and are not business-as-\nusual projects. Despite facing barriers like high investment cost, financially unattractive cost of\npower generation, erratic power generation and other barriers discussed in detail in the following\nparagraphs, the project proponent has decided to contribute to environmental protection by\nundertaking to set up this project, as power generated using wind energy results in zero emission\nof greenhouse gases. The government of India provides fiscal and financial benefits to wind\npower project which include 80% accelerated depreciation and income tax exemption for 10\nyears2. Both the incentives have been taken into account while calculating the project IRR to\nassess the returns from the projects.\nThe project activity is additional as per the options provided under \u2018Attachment A to Appendix B\u2019\nof the simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale CDM project activity.\nThe project additionality as per the Attachment A to Appendix B is given below:\nJustification for additionality of the project\nAs per Attachment A to Appendix B the project participants shall provide an explanation to\nshow that the project activity would not have occurred anyway due to at least one of the\nfollowing barriers:\na) Investment barrier: a financially more viable alternative to the project activity would have\nled to higher emissions;\nb) Technological barrier: a less technologically advanced alternative to the project activity\ninvolves lower risks due to the performance uncertainty or low market share of the new\ntechnology adopted for the project activity and so would have led to higher emissions;\nc) Barrier due to prevailing practice: prevailing practice or existing regulatory or policy\nrequirements would have led to implementation of a technology with higher emissions;\n14\n\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-PDD) - Version 03\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board\nd) Other barriers: without the project activity, for another specific reason identified by the\nproject participant, such as institutional barriers or limited information, managerial\nresources, organizational capacity, financial resources, or capacity to absorb new\ntechnologies, emissions would have been higher.\nInvestment Barrier:\nThe investment analysis for this project activity is done as per the Methodological Tool \u2013\u201cTool\nfor the demonstration and assessment of additionality\u201d, version 05.2, EB 39.\nAs per this tool, project proponent is required to determine that the project activity is not:\n(a) The most economically or financially attractive; or\n(b) Economically or financially feasible, without the revenue from the sale of certified emission\nreductions (CERs).\nBy applying the following sub-steps:\nSub-step 2a: Determine appropriate analysis method\nAs per Sub-step 2a, Paragraph (1), Option I i. e. Simple Cost Analysis can be used only if the\nCDM project activity generate no financial or economic benefits other than CDM related income. As\nthe proposed CDM project is selling the electricity generated to the regional electricity grid &\ngetting financial benefits other than CDM benefits hence, Option- I is not applicable. Option II\n(Investment Comparison Analysis) or Option III (Benchmark Analysis) is therefore applicable to\nthe project activity. Further, as per paragraph 16 of \u2018Guidelines on the Assessment of Investment\nAnalysis\u2019 (Version- 3.1, EB- 51) - If the alternative to the project activity is the supply of\nelectricity from a grid this is not to be considered an investment and a benchmark approach is\nconsidered appropriate. Hence, project promoter has considered Benchmark analysis to prove\nthe additionality of the project.\nSub-step 2b: Option III. Apply benchmark analysis\nThe \u2018Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality\u2019 (Version- 05.2, EB- 39)\nrequires the PP to identify the financial indicator, such as IRR, NPV, cost benefit ratio, or unit\ncost of service (e.g. levelized cost of electricity production in $\/kWh or levelized cost of\ndelivered heat in $\/GJ) most suitable for the project type and decision-making context. The tool\npermits the use of either Project IRR or Equity IRR to demonstrate the additionality of the\nproject. Since the project is 100% equity funded, PP has considered project IRR as suitable\nfinancial indicator, as the equity IRR and project IRR will be same for the project.\nSuitability of benchmark:\nThe PP\u2019s has decided to follow the \u201cTool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality\u201d\n(Version- 05.2, Annex- 10, EB- 39) which allows following options to derive the benchmark for\nproject activity.\na) Government bond rates, increased by a suitable risk premium to reflect private investment\nand\/or the project type, as substantiated by an independent (financial) expert or documented\nby official publicly available financial data;\n15\n\n[['', '', 'Suzlon', 'Enercon'], ['No. of machine', '', '3.00', '2.00'], ['Capacity \/machine', 'KW', '1,250.00', '800.00'], ['Total Capacity', 'KW', '3,750.00', '1,600.00'], ['Generation and sale of\\nelectricity', '', '', ''], ['Net Annual generation from\\nthe Project', 'Million kWh', '6.244', '2.726'], ['Plant Load Factor', 'Percent', '19.01%', '19.45%'], ['Selling rate', 'INR\/kWh', '4.28', '4.28'], ['O&M charges', 'INR in Million', '2.355', '1.00'], ['Escalation in the O&M\\nexpenses', 'Percent', '5%', '5%'], ['O&M applicable', 'Year', '3rd', '2nd'], ['Service tax on O&M charges', 'Percent', '10.30%', '10.30%'], ['Deration in Energy on 6th,\\n10th, 14th and 18th year.', 'Percent', '1.25%', '1.25%'], ['Insurance', 'INR in Million', '0.283', '0.131']]\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-PDD) - Version 03\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board\nb) Estimates of the cost of financing and required return on capital (e.g. commercial lending\nrates and guarantees required for the country and the type of project activity concerned),\nbased on bankers views and private equity investors\/funds required return on comparable\nprojects;\nc) A company internal benchmark (weighted average capital cost of the company), only in the\nparticular case referred to above in paragraph 5.

The PLR at the time of project\nconceptualization was in the range of 11 % to 12 %1, hence average BPLR of 11.50% has been\nconsidered as benchmark of the project.\nSub-step 2c.

Deforestation projections show that within Acre's territory,\nmost forests, or 43%, are at medium risk of deforestation while 39% of the state's forest cover is at high\nrisk. The smallest portion of the territory (0.53%) is at very high risk. Specifically Feij\u00f3, the municipality\nwhere the project is located, is the Acre municipality at greatest risk of deforestation and the eighth in the\nentire legal Amazon Rainforest2.\nThe Project has 30,299.37 hectares of conserved forest, with the predominant vegetation being Open\nOmbrophilous Forest, and aims to reduce GHG emissions by 6,479,099tCO eq over 40 years by 2\nconserving the forest cover threatened by unplanned and planned deforestation.\nActing in three different spheres, climate, social and biodiversity, the Rio Muru REDD+ Project hopes to\ndrive a long-term change in land use activities by transforming the main agents of deforestation and forest\ndegradation. To this end, the project will help build sustainable, low-emission alternative livelihoods and\nmaintain constant efforts to ensure that no displacement of emissions or environmental damage occurs. In\naddition, the project will work in three major areas: infrastructure, education, health, and the economy,\nbringing long-term benefits to the traditional communities present.\nThe project area is home to around 215 species of flora and, according to secondary data, more than 1,200\nspecies of vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) have an occurrence or potential\ndistribution within a 200km radius of the project area. Specifically in the project area, after collecting primary\ndata, 538 species of vertebrates have already been identified, even without including fish, bats and small\nnon-flying mammals.\n1 Relat\u00f3rio Anual de Desmatamento 2022 - S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil.

The project\u2019s aim is to restore the local\ndegraded grassland ecosystem by seeding grass on black soil beach, increase carbon\nsequestration and contribute to local development by introducing sustainable grazing and\nmanagement of grassland. The project proponent is Qinghai Guanglv Landscaping Co., Ltd.\nThe project area covers 6 counties (Maqin County, Dari County, Gande County, Jiuzhi County,\nBanma County and Maduo County) of Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture which is within the\nboudary of Three River (Yangtze River, Yellow River and Lancang River) Source Region. The three\nRiver Source is the highest natural wetland in China, with an average elevation of more than 4,000\nmeters, and is known as the \"Chinese Water Tower\". And about 25% of the total water volume of\nthe Yangtze River, 49% of the total water volume of the Yellow River and 15% of the total water\nvolume of the Lancang River come from this area. In addition, it is the region with the richest\nbiodiversity in high-altitude areas in the world. According to the baseline survey, the Black Soil\nType grassland degradation occurred broadly in Three River Source Region14 over the past\ndecades, due to long-term impact of climate change and overgrazing, and before the\nimplementation of the project, the planting area was black soil beach15.\nThe project is to restore the degraded grassland ecosystem by seeding a variety of species of\nnative grass. Totally, 160,548.96 ha of black soil beaches in Guoluo were planted with Elymus\ndahuricus Turcz. (Lyme grass), Poa annual. (Bluegrass) and Festuca sinensis Keng ex S. L. Lu\n(Chinese fescue), and then carry out sustainable grassland management.\nThe objectives of the project including:\n1 Restore the degraded grassland ecosystem, increase grassland coverage, improve grazing\nmeasures and improve the living conditions of local residents;\n2 Improve the livelihood of local herders, provide permanent and temporary job opportunities for\nthem, increase their income. Provide technical skills and training in sustainable grassland\nmanagement, increases interaction within the community and improve the well-being of local\ncommunities;\n3 Provide more suitable habitats for wild animals and increase local biodiversity. The\nimplementation of the project will generate GHG emission removals by increasing soil organics,\n14 Three River Source Region is the source catchment area of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River and the Lancang\nRiver, and is located in the south of Qinghai Province.\n15 According to \u201cTechnical specification for artificial vegetation establishment and utilization management of \"black soil\ntype\" degraded grassland\u201d (DB63\/T603\u20142006), black soil beach refers to degraded grassland with original vegetation\ncoverage less than 10%, fresh grass yield less than 300kg\/hm2, low soil water content, low bulk density, tending to\nalkalinity, organic matter content less than 100g\/kg and soil layer thickness greater than 20cm.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 9\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nmitigate the impact of climate change on the local ecological environment, such as slow down the\nmelting of snow-capped mountains.\nThe project is estimated to generate GHG emission removals of 17,664,275 tCO e, with an average 2\nannual GHG emission reductions of 441,607 tCO e. 2\nFigure 2-1 The restored black soil beach in the project area"}]}

This province is\nland locked and borders Yunnan to the west, Sichuan to the northwest, Hunan to the East and Chongqing\nto the North. The population of the province is 34 million.\nThe Puzhen Afforestation Project (hereafter referred as \u201cthe Project\u201d) is located within 2 counties;\nPuding County and Zhenning County, The project is to plant native species on barren land for purposes\nof GHG removal whilst contributing to local sustainable development goals. The project is implemented\njointly by Forestry Bureau of Puding County and Forestry Bureau of Zhenning County.26,551ha of\nforest was planted on degraded lands in these two counties.\nThe Project involves a total of 227 villages in 2 counties, with a total population of nearly 88,202 people.\nAll the barren lands for afforestation activities belong to the villagers and the village committees manage\nthe lands on behalf of the villagers. Guizhou Baiheng Fertilizer Co., Ltd (hereinafter referred to as\nGuizhou Baiheng or Baiheng) has been fully authorized by all the village committees through a signed\ncontract to act as the project proponent to implement project implementation, management, monitoring\nand to sell VCUs generated from the project. This enables Baiheng to consolidate the offset resources\ninto sizeable forestry offset projects. Baiheng will profit-share with the villagers from the sale of VCUs.\nThe implementation of the project activity has provided 19,900 jobs for local villagers, among which 70%\nare women.\nThe project activity aims to:\n- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate change;\n- Enhance biodiversity conservation by increasing the connectivity of forests;\n- Improve soil and water conservation in the Karst region and increase the forest cover;\n- Generate income and job opportunities for local village communities.\nThere is no natural renewal and afforestation before the project, and all sites were covered by barren\nland. The main species planted is Cypress which is the native species according to the baseline survey.\nThe implementation of the project would reduce GHG emissions amounting to 9,390,696 tCO e over the 2\nnext 30 years, with an average annual GHG emission of 313,023 tCO e. 2\nCCB v3.0, VCS 8\n\nCCB + VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3"}]}

Description of the small-scale project activity:\n>>\nThe primary objective of the PESHP Project is to help meet Brazil\u2019s rising demand for energy due to\neconomic growth and to improve the supply of electricity, while contributing to the environmental, social\nand economic sustainability by increasing renewable energy\u2019s share of the total Brazilian (and the Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean region\u2019s) electricity consumption.\nThe Latin America and the Caribbean region countries have expressed their commitment towards\nachieving a target of 10% renewable energy of the total energy use in the region. Through an initiative of the\nMinisters of the Environment in 2002 (UNEP-LAC1), a preliminary meeting of the World Summit for\nSustainable Development (WSSD) was held in Johannesburg in 1992. In the WSSD final Plan of\nImplementation no specific targets or timeframes were stated, however, their importance was recognized for\nachieving sustainability in accordance with the Millennium Development Goals2.\nThe PESHP is located in the south of Brazil, where the largest coal reserves are located as well as the\nmost of thermo power plants using this fuel. The project consists of a small-hydro power plant (12.44 MW)\nlocated in the Jaguaria\u00edva River, in the city of Jaguaria\u00edva, state of Paran\u00e1 (Figure 1). According to the\nBrazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (from the Portuguese Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e\nEstat\u00edstica - IBGE) Jaguaria\u00edva is a city with 32,606 inhabitants located next to the agricultural region of\nPonta Grossa3.\n1 UNEP-LAC (2002).

The entrepreneurship is\na joint venture owned by three agricultural cooperatives. These agricultural cooperatives control three\nsmaller cooperatives created specifically to commercialize the electricity. These three controlled\ncooperatives specialize in agricultural electrification have 2,500km in transmission lines and commercialize\nmore than 100,000MWh per year. The number of associates is approximately 3,000 and the number of\ncustomers is over 7,000. PESHP delivers about 80,000 MWh\/year (with an estimated minimum capacity\nfactor of 74.3%) to the South-Southeast-Midwest interconnected grid since February 2003.\nThis indigenous and cleaner source of electricity will also have an important contribution to\nenvironmental sustainability by reducing carbon dioxide emissions that would have occurred otherwise in\nthe absence of the project. The project activity reduces emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) by avoiding\nelectricity generation by fossil fuel sources (and CO emissions), which would be generating (and emitting) 2\nin the absence of the project.\nThe PESHP Project improves the supply of electricity with clean, renewable hydroelectric power\nwhile contributing to the regional\/local economic development. Small-scale hydropower run-of-river plants\nprovide local distributed generation, site-specific reliability and transmission and distribution benefits\nincluding:\n\u2022 increased reliability and shorter and less extensive outages\n\u2022 lower reserve margin requirements\n\u2022 improved power quality\n\u2022 reduced lines losses\n\u2022 reactive power control\n\u2022 mitigation of transmission and distribution congestion, and\n\u2022 increased system capacity with reduced T&D investment.\nIt can be said that fair income distribution is achieved from job creation and an increase in people\u2019s\nwages, however better income distribution in the region where the PESHP Project is located is obtained\nfrom less expenditures and more income in the local municipalities. The surplus of capital that these\n4\n\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-PDD) - Version 03\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board\nmunicipalities will have could be translated into investments in education and health which will directly\nbenefit the local population and indirectly impact a more equitable income distribution. The lower\nexpenditure is generated due to the fact that money will no longer be spent in the same amount to \u201cimport\u201d\nelectricity from other regions in the country through the grid. This money would stay in the region and be\nused for providing the population better services which would improve the availability of basic needs. The\nlocal population will receive economic benefits from royalties paid to the municipalities for the water rights\ngranted to PESHP.\nA strong indication that PESHP contributes to the country\u2019s sustainable development goals is that the\nproject is in accordance with the April 2002 law # 10,438 Proinfa (Programa de Incentivo as Fontes\nAlternativas de Energia El\u00e9trica). Proinfa is a Brazilian federal program that gives incentive to alternative\nsources of electricity (wind energy, biomass cogeneration, and a small scale hydropower plant). Among\nother factors, this initiative\u2019s goal is to increase the renewable energy source share in the Brazilian\nelectricity matrix in order to contribute to a greater environmental sustainability through giving these\nrenewable energy sources better economic advantages. The Brazilian government has committed significant\nfunding in order to develop this plan.\nAlthough PESHP is in accordance with Proinfa once it is an alternative source of energy, it was not\neligible to access the advantages of the program because the plant was already constructed when the law was\nfinally approved in 2002. Besides it is also important to mention that the Brazilian Decree nr. 5,025 dated\nMarch 30th, 20041, which regulates the Law nr. 10,438 dated April 26th, 20024 that created PROINFA, states\nthat the program aims for the reduction of greenhouse gases as established by the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) under Kyoto Protocol, contributing to the\nsustainable development. Therefore, the program is clearly a \u201cType E-\u201d policy5 and need not be taken into\naccount in developing a baseline scenario.\n4 Available at: http:\/\/www.eletrobras.com\/elb\/data\/Pages\/LUMISABB61D26PTBRIE.htm#Legisla\u00e7\u00e3o.\n5 Type E- policies are defined as \u201cnational and\/or sectoral policies or regulations that give comparative advantages to less\nemissions-intensive technologies over more emissions-intensive technologies\u201d, in accordance to Annex 3, EB 22, available at\nhttp:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/Reference\/Guidclarif\/meth\/meth_guid08_v02.pdf.\n5\n\nPROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-PDD) - Version 03\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board"}]}

The project will use\na programmatic approach (grouped project).\n\nForests of the project area have become important areas for conservation (Solano et al., 2005). Although\nthese are strategic ecosystems in the provision of environmental services, they are surrounded by a\nmosaic of pasturelands and thus have become highly fragmented and threatened with the expansion of\nthe agricultural frontier. To continue supporting both production and conservation on these lands,\nadaptation strategies and alternatives to current regional production systems must be sought to both\nintegrate the sustainable use of natural resources and allow for the connectivity of strategic ecosystems.\nIn keeping with the REDD+ approach of examining the direct relationship between human activities,\ndeforestation, and forest degradation, a series of project activities has been proposed to reduce the\naforementioned threats on the forests in the project zone and mitigate the associated GHG emissions. In\nparallel, the project activities described in this section seek to: (i) promote sustainable economic activities\nthat positively impact the local community while reducing the impact of production on forests, (ii) integrate\nland management into the socioeconomic and political climate, and (iii) fortify management, governance,\nand technical capacities to ensure the efficient implementation of the REDD+ project.\nThe development of the following series of project activities has been proposed after having carefully\naccounted for the ideas and the wealth of accumulated knowledge particular to the project zone. Among\nthe considered information were: a socioeconomic evaluation of the study area (reported from official\nsources such as the \u201cScheme for Land Management\u201d and the \u201cMunicipal Development Plans\u201d), the\nManagement Plan of the Regional Integrated Management District (DRMI) of the paramos of \u201cGuantiva\nand La Rusia oak forests and surrounding lands,\u201d an assessment of agents and drivers of deforestation\nand degradation, input from the community, and the expertise of those with institutional and community\nexperience in the implementation of sustainable production activities.\nThe project is not located within a jurisdiction covered by a jurisdictional REDD+ program49. Due to\nrestricted financial capacity, the project activities have been prioritized into two distinct groups to ensure\neffective implementation by Fundaci\u00f3n Natura:\nProject Activities \u2013 Priority:\n1.

In the case of PE, the grid consists of fossil fuel fired generators\nand hydropower stations: Therefore, the following options for determination of the baseline emission\ncoefficient remain:\na) The average of the \u201capproximate operating margin\u201d and the \u201cbuild margin\u201d,\nOR\nb) The weighted average emissions of the current generation mix\nThe GBAO grid faces the special situation that during the last years the existing diesel capacity has been\noperated only to a limited extent due to the circumstances described earlier in this PDD. In addition, no\nconsistent data is available for the last years to calculate the weighted average emissions of the current\ngeneration mix. Therefore, option a) is selected.\nTable 2 below provides an overview of the data, and data sources used for the baseline calculation in this\nproject activity.\nTable 2: Data sources for determining the baseline scenarios and applying the baseline calculations\n\n[['Average operating margin (OM)', 't CO2 \/ MWh', '1.0782']]\n[['Build margin (BM)', 't CO2 \/ MWh', '0']]\nCDM-SSC-PDD (version 02)\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board page 12\nCalculation of the Operating margin (OM)\nThe OM is the weighted average emissions of all generating sources serving the system, excluding hydro\nand other renewable generation sources (in t CO2 \/ MWh).\nConsistent and up-to-date data on diesel fuel consumption and energy production to estimate the operating\nmargin (OM) in the GBAO grid is not available due to the circumstances during and after the civil war.\nThe most reliable data on diesel power production derives from the diesel power plants taken over by PE\nand is only available up to the year 1992. Despite the fact that this is historical data, it is sufficient to\ncalculate an average operating margin for the remaining fossil installations, which would have been partly\nre-operated in the absence of the project activity. The average operating margin has been calculated from\nthe data of the years 1988 to 1992. Respective data is given in Annex 3.\nCalculation of the Build Margin (BM)\nThe BM is the weighted average emissions of recent capacity additions to the system, which capacity\nadditions are defined as the greater (in MWh) of (i) most recent 20% of the existing plants or (ii) the 5\nmost recent plants.\nSince 1990 no new diesel power capacity has been added to the GBAO system. All recently (1992 \u20131999)\nadded systems are micro hydropower plants, except the Pamir I units 1 & 2. As mentioned in section\nA.4.3., the repair or completion of these hydropower plants were financed with small amounts by the\nGovernment with strong support from AKFED and other NGOs. The plants are summarized in the list\nbelow:\n1. Siponj, 1992 (160 kW), fully financed by Barki Tajik with US$ 93\u2019000\n2. Pamir I units 1&2, 1994 (14MW), major works completed before 1990. The Government\nmanaged to bring online the already installed units 1 & 2 in 1994 with significant help from\nAKFED.\n3. Tekharv, 1995 (360 kW), Governmental financing with support form AKFED\n4. Andarbak, 1999 (300 kW), US$ 130\u2019000 half financed by the Government and half by AKFED\nCompared to the former 28 MW diesel capacity (making around 60% of the former total capacity) these\nunits bring only insignificant additions to the grid, except Pamir I units 1 & 2.\nHowever, all the described circumstances make it difficult to establish a Build Margin. To be on the most\nconservative side, it was decided to set the BM to zero.\n\nCDM-SSC-PDD (version 02)\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board page 13"}]}

Leakage would only occur if pre-project activities\nby previous owners would be shifted somewhere else in detriment of natural forests and\/or\necosystems. The risk of leakage is low, as deforestation is not allowed in the region, and the\nprevious owner did not move to an area regarded as an agricultural frontier.\nCommercially Sensitive Information\nNone.\nSustainable Development\nThe project contributes to the national forest sector by providing proof of concept and\nimplementation of models aligned to political goals, such as the national plan of reforestation\n(Decree N\u00ba 10,147 of 2012), governmental efforts to formalize the biomass sector (Decree N\u00ba\n4056\/2015), and the contribution to the National Determined Contributions of the country,\nwhere afforestation is highlighted as a prominent measure.\nOn the other hand, the Forestal Azul Carbon Project will be one of the first to introduce the carbon\ncomponent, which will bring about proof of concept and more experience in the region. The\nproject managers will inform the national authorities of the Project, to avoid any possible double\naccounting in the future, and contribute to any governmental efforts in this regard.\nFurther Information\nAdditional information is provided in the Appendix and in the relevant sections.\n2 SAFEGUARDS\n2.1 No Net Harm\nSummary of environmental impact\n\uf0b7 The project seeks to recover degraded natural forests, with potential impact for the whole\ncountry in terms of introducing and providing proof of concept for a viable natural forest\nrestoration model. Otherwise, these forests are subject to continuous degradation. While the\nGovernment has been introducing other mechanisms to foster forest protection (through\nPayments for Environmental Services, for example), these are not yet making a difference\nas they are not effectively working on a large scale.\n\uf0b7 The project targets areas already heavily modified (used for beef production or mechanized\nagriculture) for eucalypt planting. These areas have been deforested decades ago. Tree\nplanting on these sites reduces erosion, contributes to an improved water household,\n\nsequesters carbon and in some cases, provides better condition for the connection of natural\nforests (natural corridors for biodiversity).\n\uf0b7 Forestal Azul holds a valid environmental license. While the environmental license is not\nsubject to exhaustive monitoring by authorities, it is a good tool to ensure compliance to the\nmost important environmental regulation (such as non-deforestation, maintenance of the\nminimum natural forest reserve, and buffer zones), which is evaluated by the Environmental\nMinistry through satellite imagery at a frequency of about 2 years.\n\uf0b7 The plantations require input such as lime, fertilizer, and pesticides for ant and weed control\n(Glyphosate and Fipronil). These are common products in Paraguay, already used before the\nactivity on these sites. The input use of the plantations is much lower when compared to\nagriculture, and roughly the same or slightly higher when compared to beef production.\n\uf0b7 To date, all commercial forest plantations are still dependent to a certain degree on using\nherbicides. Weed control is particularly important in the first year of plantation\nestablishment to ensure the survival of the trees. During this time, weed grows faster than\nimplanted trees leading to strong competition and death of trees if left uncontrolled.\nThere are several ways of controlling weeds. In Forestal Azul, chemical pesticide control with\nGlyphosate is used in combination with manual control and animals that control weeds in\nSilvopastoral systems.\nAround 4-10 liters \/ ha are employed for a whole forestry cycle (12 years), usually all in the\nfirst two years (2-3 applications per year). After year 3, herbicides are discontinued or used\nvery punctually. It should be noted that forest plantations are replacing previous uses where\nglyphosate use is more intense. In the first instance, 56 % of plantations are established on\nareas previously used for intensive agriculture that require around 15 l\/ha\/year (in total over\n12 years 180 l\/ha) and 44 % replacing traditional cattle systems where the use of herbicides\nis roughly the same as in forestry when considering the whole forestry cycle. Therefore,\noverall, the net environmental impact of forest plantations is strongly positive, reducing the\nuse of Glyphosate significantly.\nRegarding risk mitigation, all pesticides are managed according to best practice, and they are\nused specifically and following health and safety standards and environmental mitigation\nmeasures. This is also controlled during annual FSC audits.\nSummary of socio-economic impact\n\uf0b7 Forestal Azul holds a legal title that is not subject to claims from third parties. During the\ndue diligence conducted in 2018, conflicts between the former property owners and local\ncommunities were not identified.\n\uf0b7 Neighboring community members do not depend on the resources on production sites,\nmeaning forest production does not restrict local people\u2019s access or use of resources of\ncritical importance to their livelihoods, or negatively affect ecosystem services. Mostly,\ncommunity members have small plots for cultivation and animal husbandry, or work in\nneighboring properties.\n\n\uf0b7 Compared to previous land uses, the plantations provide benefits to local people, by\nproviding local jobs. Plantations forestry provides around 25 Full Time Equivalents per 1,000\nha compared to 2-3 Full Time Equivalents on traditional cattle ranches. This number is even\nhigher for the degraded natural forest restoration, as it requires high input of manual labour.\nBetween 2018-2020, Forestal Azul maintained between 30 and 80 employees, most of the\ncoming from the neighboring community Paso Tuna.\n\uf0b7 All labour complies with social security and the labour code. This is a net positive impact in\nan environment were 80 % of labour is informal.\n\uf0b7 Forestal Azul seeks to introduce productive projects with neighboring community members\nstarting in 2021. The plan is to establish eucalypt plantations on smallholder land (target is\nto work with around 10 to 15 producers and potentially expand in the future), with the\nprovision of inputs and technical assistance by the company. Income is then shared after\nthinning and harvesting.\nGeneral safeguards\n\uf0b7 The project is FSC certified and subject to annual third party verification since 2018 (FSC\u00ae\nC141437)."}]}

The Paraguayan Chaco\nconsists of mainly privately owned land, and very few legally protected natural reserves. The scenario\nexisting prior to the implementation of the Project is that many private lands are being deforested for\ncattle ranching or soybean production and Atenil was seeking such a buyer for their land.\nWhile the initial project property is approximately 31,858.6 hectares (ha), it is the intention to scale this\ngrouped project to over 300,000 ha of privately owned land. The conditions under which grouped project\neligibility is being established are: the baseline agent of deforestation will be similar large agribusinesses\nimplement industrial scale cattle ranch, each additional project instance will meet the applicability\nconditions of each VM0007 module used to develop this Initial Project Instance, and quantification of\nbaseline, with-project, and leakage will follow the equations outlined in this Project Document.\nThe total estimated ERs over the initial project instance\u2019s first ten years of crediting is 5,601,376 ERs and\nthe annual average is 560,138 ERs.\nBy undertaking this conservation initiative, Quadriz Paraguay S.A. and Atenil S.A. will alleviate pressure\non natural forest habitat in the Chaco Region in Paraguay. The Coraz\u00f3n Verde del Chaco Project will\nmitigate deforestation pressures and the associated greenhouse gas emissions in the region, which is the\nmain climate objective of the Project. The main community objective of the Project is to provide social\nprograms to improve the livelihoods of community members living in the vicinity of the Project. The main\nbiodiversity objective of the Project is the preservation of biodiversity, particularly medium-to-large\nmammals in the project areas.\nOver the Project Lifetime, the Coraz\u00f3n Verde del Chaco Project will implement the following project\nactivities:\n\u2022 Forego Selling of Property, Then Clearing and Conversion of the Project Areas;\n\u2022 Provide Healthcare Services;\n\u2022 Raise Project Awareness;\n\u2022 Patrol and Monitor Deforestation;\n\u2022 Establish a Project Headquarters; and\n\u2022 Monitor Medium-to-Large Mammals in the Project Areas.\nForegoing the sale of the property and the subsequent clearing and conversion of the Project Areas (i.e.,\nto pasture and\/or agriculture), along with patrolling and monitoring for deforestation, will directly align with\nthe Project\u2019s climate objective. Improving the livelihoods of community members living in the vicinity of the\nProject (i.e., the community objective) will be accomplished through providing healthcare services, raising\nproject awareness, and through establishing a project headquarters.

Purpose and general description of project activity\nProject Activity:\nSolarfield Energy Private Limited (hereafter Solarfield) proposes to develop a 20 MW grid connected\nsolar PV power project in Patan District in the State of Gujarat in India. The plant is using solar PV\nsystem using thin film technology. The PV array converts sunlight into Direct current (DC). The DC\noutput from the modules is fed into the PCU, which converts DC electricity to Alternating Current (AC).\nThe AC energy will be stepped up by a step up transformer and will be synchronised with the state\nelectricity grid of Gujarat, which is a part of NEWNE grid of India. The net power generated from this\nproject will be sold to Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) through a power purchase\nagreement with GUVNL.\nThis is a green field project. The project activity is being set up in a waste land, where no power\ngeneration unit exists prior to the project activity. The purpose of this project is to generate electricity by\nutilizing clean solar energy and to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions, which otherwise would have\nbeen emitted by the existing fossil fuel based power plants connected to the NEWNE grid in India or the\naddition of similar kind of fossil fuel based power plants. The NEWNE grid is dominated by fossil fuel\nfired thermal power plants. In absence of the project activity, equivalent amount of power would have\nbeen generated and supplied by NEWNE grid which the project is connected. The project activity is\nexpected to reduce on an average 28,784 tonnes of CO annually over the ten years crediting period. 2\nProject\u2019s contribution to sustainable development:\nThe implementation of this project activity would contribute to the sustainable development of the region\nin the following ways as stipulated by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) in the interim\napproval guidelines for CDM projects \u2013\nSocial well being:\n\u2022 Employment opportunities will be created for the local workforce during the project construction\nand operation phase.\nEconomic well-being:\n\u2022 The enhanced employment opportunities created by this project activity will lead to alleviation of\npoverty, and unemployment, as it is ideal and more feasible for the project developer to employ\nlocal workforce during the construction period and operational life time.\n\u2022 The project activity will create business opportunities for local people.\n\u2022 Furthermore it would attract other investors to invest in the same region, enhancing the\nemployment opportunities for local populace.\nEnvironmental well-being:\n\u2022 This project activity would be using the available solar potential in the region for power\ngeneration process and hence will reduce SOx, NOx, suspended particulate matter emissions\nbesides GHG emissions by avoiding power generating from fossil fuel based power plants\nconnected to the regional grid.\nTechnological well-being:\n\u2022 The project activity will be making use of the reliable and proven technology to ensure that an\nenvironmentally safe technology is only being implemented in the project activity.\n\nUNFCCC\/CCNUCC\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board Page 3\nSetting up of this project will also increase the private sector participation in this project category\nthereby contributing to more green power to the grid system."}]}

In the process, an equivalent quantum of electricity that\nwould have been generated by the grid in line with the grid electricity generation mix\nis displaced by the project activity. The carbon intensity of the fossil-fuel dominated\ngeneration mix of the grid is evident from the following break-up of various types of\nenergy sources constituting the grid-mix contributing electricity to the Southern Grid\nsystem.\nTable 7: Power Generation mix of southern regional grid of India\nSourc : Central Electricity authority10 as on 31\/01\/2009\n*From Wind Energy Sources as on 30\/09\/200811\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n2. \u201cIf the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a\nwind\/diesel unit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small-scale CDM project activity\napplies only to the renewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel, the\ncapacity of the entire unit shall not exceed the limit of 15MW\u201d.\nThe project activity involves only wind power generation. The gross wind power\ngeneration capacity of the bundled project activity is 7.5 MW, which is less than 15\nMW, as stipulated in the applicability criterion under consideration.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n3. \u201cCombined heat and power (co-generation) systems are not eligible under\nthis category\u201d\nThe project activity involves generation of electricity only through WTGs and is not a\nco-generation system.\n9Refer to: The Southern Regional Electricity Grid of India is primarily constituted of fossil- fuel fired thermal power\nplants. Refer to CO Baseline Database Version 4.0 Dated October 2008 available at 2\nhttp:\/\/www.cea.nic.in\/planning\/c%20and%20e\/Government%20of%20India%20website.htm\n10 Refer to: http:\/\/www.cea.nic.in\/power_sec_reports\/Executive_Summary\/2009_01\/27-33.pdf\n11 Refer to: http:\/\/www.cwet.tn.nic.in\/html\/information_isw.html\n21\n\nVCS Project Description\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n4. \u201cIn the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy\ngeneration units at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added\ncapacity of the units added by the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be\nphysically distinct from the existing units.\u201d\nThe project activity does not involve the addition of renewable energy generation\nunits at an existing renewable power generation facility.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n5. \u201cProject activities that seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for\nrenewable energy generation are included in this category. To qualify as a small\nscale project, the total output of the modified or retrofitted unit shall not exceed the\nlimit of 15 MW\u201d\nThe renewable energy generating wind-farms employed by the project activity are\nnewly constructed set up and does not involve retrofitting or modification of any\nexisting facility for renewable energy generation.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\nThus, the project activity fulfills all the applicability criteria of the simplified small scale\nmethodology AMS-I.D.\/ Version 1412."}]}

The objective of\nthe Eglence I-II Hydroelectric Power Plant (Eglence I-II HEPP) is to generate electricity and supply it\ninto the public grid. It shall be registered as a VCS project in order to facilitate the project\nimplementation by means of financial inflows coming from the credits sale. Due to its significant\ncontribution to climate change mitigation and sustainable development in the region, this project is\nexpected to fulfil the requirements of VCS rigorously.\nEglence I-II, a run-off-river hydroelectric power plant, is located on the Eglence River, in the\nMediterranean Region within the Karaisali disrict of Adana province. E\u011flence I-II consists of\nconstruction of a green field project with 68.65 MWe of installed capacity comprising two weirs and two\npower houses. (The units proposed to be established upstream are named as \u201cEglence-I\u201d while the\nunits proposed to be established downstream are named as \u201cEglence-II\u201d. Therefore; these mentioned\nsupplementary projects are observed as a whole named \u201cEglence I-II\u201d) A regulator at a talweg\nelevation of 693.0 meters within the borders of Yenikoy district is planned. The rising water will first be\ntaken to a sedimentation pool followed by a two-peace conveyance tunnel. There will be a conduit\nbetween them. With the aid of a shaft, water will be transferred to the Eglence I power house. The tail\nwater coming out of Eglence I power station will be transferred to the conveyance tunnel. after which\nwater will be first transferred to a head pond and a penstock. Finally, water will be transported to the\nEglence II power house, planned to be found on the right bank of the river. Each power house will be\ncomprised of three turbines.1 The installed capacity of Eglence I will be 42.65 MWe, generating\napproximately 127,280 MWh of clean energy per annum2, while the installed capacity of Eglence II\nwill be 26.00 MWe, generating approximately 78,019 MWh of clean energy per annum3. (Net of\ninternal usage)\nThe purpose of this document is to assert that the implementation of the proposed project faces\nfinancial risks that are hard to overcome without carbon financing. Other than financial impediments,\naccording to the EIA Reports, there not any serious risks that may substantially affect the project\u2019s\nGHG emission reductions.

For such cases, the tool suggests using the following criteria to determine the\nexistence of significant transmission constraints:\n1. \u201cIn case of electricity systems with spot markets for electricity: there are differences in electricity\nprices (without transmission and distribution costs) of more than 5 percent between the systems\nduring 60 percent or more of the hours of the year.\u201d This criteria is not applicable as there is no\nspot electricity market in the host country.\n2. \u201cThe transmission line is operated at 90% or more of its rated capacity during 90% percent or\nmore of the hours of the year\u201d: The transmission line operator (TEIAS) or any other official source\nhas not published the capacity usage figures for the Turkish grid, hence this criterion can not be\nproved.\nAccording to the tool, where the application of these criteria does not result in a clear grid\nboundary, a regional grid definition in the case of large countries with layered dispatch systems\n(e.g. provincial \/ regional \/ national) shall be used. A provincial grid definition may indeed in many\ncases be too narrow given significant electricity trade among provinces that might be affected,\ndirectly or indirectly, by a CDM project activity. In other countries, the national (or other largest)\ngrid definition should be used by default.\nTherefore, for the case of the subject project activity \u201cthe project electricity system\u201d and \u201cthe\nconnected system\u201d are same, and the Turkish National Grid is used as the \u201cproject electricity\nsystem\u201d. It is also confirmed by TEIAS that the Turkish grid is interconnected. There isn\u2019t any\nindependent or regional grid system in any region of Turkey. The map of the Turkish Electricity\nGrid is given in the below figure (Figure 10):\nv3.0 28\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nFigure 10: The Map showing the boundaries of Turkish Electricity Grid (Source Electricity Market\nReport 2010, by Electricity Market Regulatory Authority\nhttp:\/\/www.epdk.gov.tr\/documents\/10157\/48dd12d4-74da-4dcf-9f48-86983146c0d8)\nAll the calculations details of which are given below are made for the entire Turkish Grid.\nStep 2 - Choose whether to include off-grid power plants in the project electricity system\nThe tool requires Project participants to choose between the following two options to calculate the\noperating margin and build margin emission factor:\nOption I: Only grid power plants are included in the calculation.\nOption II: Both grid power plants and off-grid power plants are included in the calculation.\nIn our case, \u201cOption I\u201d has been selected for the calculation of grid emission factor, and only grid\npower plants are included in the calculation.\nStep 3 \u2013 Select an operating margin (OM) method\nAccording to the \u201cTool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system\u201f, version 02.2.1 in\ncalculating the Operating Margin grid emission factor for a given year y (EFgrid,OM, y), project\ndevelopers have the option of selecting from four methods:\n(a) Simple OM,\n(b) Simple adjusted OM,\n(c) Dispatch Data Analysis OM, or\nv3.0 29"}]}

The historic reference period spans the period of most important historic events in the\nregion. Additionally, to be complete we looked for additional satellite images available with wide\ncoverage of a large area at feasible costs \u2013 only Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery\nfulfill these criteria. The Kariba REDD+ Project utilized all available images of these sensors with\nless than 50 per cent cloud cover over the reference area within the last 15 years prior to project\nstart. This, and the fact that important historic events in the reference period (see below) are\ncovered from 2000 to 2011, makes the established reference period the only viable option.\nImportant historic events in the reference region (and national context):\nLand use and land-use change patterns over the reference region are closely linked to the\nnational economy and the agricultural land reform started by the government in the year 2000 (for\nv3.1 46\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nfurther details please refer to section 1.10).\nThe reference period therefore covers four sub-periods: a sub-period dominated by high\ndeforestation rates caused by a shift back to rural subsistence agriculture (2000-2003), a period\nof low deforestation rates due to reduced population pressure because of emigration (2004-2006)\nand also low image visibility (Landsat 7 ETM+ SLC-off), a third (2007-2009) and forth period\n(2010-2011) of increases close to the multi-annual average (2010-2011). Please see the\nadditionally provided to the cumulative deforestation model for details on observed historic\ndeforestation in the reference region. Obviously, the exact limits of our observation sub-periods\nare determined by Landsat image availability (see explanation above) and historic trends might\nhave already before the end of one sub-period. But such effects are generally averaged-out by\nfitting the cumulative deforestation model over the entire reference period. The sub-periods did\nnot enter the cumulative deforestation model but only serve to relate to historic events in the\nreference period.\nAs re-immigration into the reference area and close to the project area is slowing down but has\nnot yet fully stopped and high population growth rates above 2 per cent per year persist, we have\nconfidence that the average deforestation rate established over the entire reference period is a\nrealistic predictor for future deforestation (at least for the next 10 years until a baseline revision is\nrequired in any case).\nPicture 3: Landsat 5 TM image RGB 543 (above) and Forest \/ Non-Forest classification (below).

Description of the small-scale project activity:\nThe primary objective of Santa Edwiges I Small Hydro Power Plant is to help meet Brazil\u2019s rising\ndemand for energy due to economic growth and to improve the supply of electricity, while contributing to\nthe environmental, social and economic sustainability by increasing renewable energy\u2019s share of the total\nBrazilian (and the Latin America and the Caribbean region\u2019s) electricity consumption.\nThe Latin America and the Caribbean region countries have expressed their commitment towards\nachieving a target of 10% renewable energy of the total energy use in the region. Through an initiative of\nthe Ministers of the Environment in 2002 (UNEP-LAC, 2002), a preliminary meeting of the World\nSummit for Sustainable Development (WSSD) was held in Johannesburg in 2002. In the WSSD final\nPlan of Implementation no specific targets or timeframes were stated, however, their importance was\nrecognized for achieving sustainability in accordance with the Millennium Development Goals1.\nSanta Edwiges I Small Hydro Power Plant consists of a run-of-river small-hydro power plant (10.1\nMW), that has a small reservoir (2.52 km\u00b2) with minor environmental impact.\nThe region where the small hydro power plant is located is at the end of a grid, consequently it is\nmore susceptible to blackouts. The plant will contribute with an already existing grid (from Formosa to\nAlvorada do Norte, from Iaciara to Alvorada do Norte and from Posse to Alvorada do Norte), relieving it.\nIn addition, new industries will be able to come to the region where the project is located, contributing to\nthe development of the area.\nRialma Companhia Energ\u00e9tica I S\/A is the owner of Santa Edwiges I.

Mamba\u00ed, which is considered the poorest city in the state, has 62.36% of its population\nliving in the urban area; in Buritin\u00f3polis 51.20% of its population live in rural area. Posse has the\nprincipal economic activity based on the commercial activities.\nThe Santa Edwiges I Small Hydro Power Plant Project improves the supply of electricity with\nclean, renewable hydroelectric power while contributing to the regional\/local economic development.\nSmall-scale hydropower run-of-river plants provide local distributed generation, in contrast with the\nbusiness as usual large hydropower and natural gas fired plants built in the last 5 years, and these small-\nscale projects provide site-specific reliability and transmission and distribution benefits including:\nThis indigenous and cleaner source of electricity will also have an important contribution to\nenvironmental sustainability by reducing carbon dioxide emissions that would have occurred otherwise in\nthe absence of the project. The project activity reduces emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) by avoiding\nelectricity generation by fossil fuel sources (and CO emissions), which would be generating (and 2\nemitting) in the absence of the project.\nIt can be said that fair income distribution is achieved from job creation and an increase in people\u2019s\nwages, however better income distribution in the region where the Santa Edwiges I Project is located is\nobtained mainly from less expenditures and more income in the local municipalities. The surplus of\ncapital that these municipalities will have could be translated into investments in education and health,\nwhich will directly benefit the local population and indirectly impact a more equitable income\ndistribution. The lower expenditure is generated due to the fact that money will no longer be spent in the\nsame amount to \u201cimport\u201d electricity from other regions in the country through the grid. This money\nwould stay in the region and be used for providing the population better services, which would improve\nthe availability of basic needs, and avoid emigration. The local population will receive economic benefits\nfrom royalties paid to the municipalities for the water rights granted to Santa Edwiges I Small Hydro\nPower Plant.\n\nCDM-SSC-PDD (version 02)\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board page 4\/47"}]}

Water balance is the mass balance of water fed to\npower units, with all possible combinations of multiple reservoirs and without the construction of reservoirs. The purpose of such\nwater balance is to demonstrate the requirement of specific combination of multiple reservoirs constructed under CDM project\nactivity for the optimization of power output. This demonstration has to be carried out in the specific scenario of water availability\nin different seasons to optimize the water flow at the inlet of power units. Therefore this water balance will take into account\nseasonal flows from river, tributaries (if any), and rainfall for minimum three years prior to implementation of CDM project activity.\nv3.2 13"}]}

The\nproject is to establish forest on the barren land in the hills and wastelands to generate GHG\nemission reductions and contribute to local sustainable development. Prior to the project\nimplementation, all the project sites are barren land in the hills and wastelands, without its\nimplementation, all the sites will keep the same circumstances with no natural renewal and\nreforestation. The barrenland in the hills and wastelands of the project is due to the local karst\narea, as well as water and soil erosion. It is caused by land degradation ultimately leading to\npoorbiodiversityinthekarstareasofsouth-westernChinawhereprojectlocated.\nThe project start date is 01-06-2017 when the planting started, and the project covers 11,068.87\nha of forest which was established by direct planted on barren land in the hills and wastelands in\nQiubei county, Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province.

Additional return to forest management, thanks to REDD incentives, which can\ncompensate avoiding deforestation for other activities;\nIII.

This Leakage Management plan will be based on the monitoring parameters,\nin addition to being verified in every SocialCarbon Report.\nThe main leakage management activities are outlined below:\n\u2022 Surveillance activities designed to mitigate illegal logging and land occupation in the area\nwill be achieved through the project activity. This process will be further consolidated\nthrough combined efforts with private and governmental entities, and NGOs.\n\u2022 Inclusion of new instances: further areas with potential for REDD+ projects have already\nbeen identified around the project site, which will complement financial incentives\nobtained from credit sales and provide more social and environmental benefits to local\ncommunities.\nCombatting illegal land occupation: the local community will be strategic in monitoring illegal\nland occupation and potential illegal logging. Those who are interested in being trained and\ncarrying out local monitoring will be included in the project, an activity which may also become\na new source of income for local communities.\nCommercially Sensitive Information\nNo commercially sensitive information has been excluded from the public version of the project\ndescription.\nFurther Information\nNot applicable.\n2 SAFEGUARDS\n2.1 No Net Harm\nXingu-Araguaia Grouped REDD+ Project has conducted a social and environmental assessment\nwithin the Leakage Management Area.

In the process, an equivalent quantum of electricity that\nwould have been generated by the grid in line with the grid electricity generation mix\nis displaced by the project activity.

If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel, the\ncapacity of the entire unit shall not exceed the limit of 15MW\u201d.\nThe project activity involves only wind power generation. The gross wind power\ngeneration capacity of the bundled project activity is 7.4 MW, which is less than 15\nMW, as stipulated in the applicability criterion under consideration.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n3. \u201cCombined heat and power (co-generation) systems are not eligible under\nthis category\u201d\nThe project activity involves generation of electricity only through WTGs and is not a\nco-generation system.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n4. \u201cIn the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy\ngeneration units at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added\ncapacity of the units added by the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be\nphysically distinct from the existing units.\u201d\nThe project activity does not involve the addition of renewable energy generation\nunits at an existing renewable power generation facility.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n5. \u201cProject activities that seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for\nrenewable energy generation are included in this category.

Kenya toward the Ethiopia border. The area consists of a series of\nformer Group Ranches organized under the Northern Rangelands Trust to form wildlife\nConservancies of various sizes (Fig. 1). The project zone includes the forested mountain ranges,\nwhich are protected forest reserves, found in the center of the project area, and other pastoral\ngrazing lands to the east, west, and north. Private ranches on the Laikipia plateau lie to the\nsouthwest, and a belt of commercial farms lies to the south between the project area and the\nforests of Mt. Kenya National Park. The project area is bisected by the Ewaso Nyiro River, which\narises from the Aberdare Mountains 600 km to the southwest and flows from west to east,\nproviding the major permanent water source for the project zone.\nAnnual rainfall varies from 550 mm\/yr in the south and west to less than 350 mm\/yr in the\nnortheast. Soils are primarily eroded sandy loams (20-30% clay) interspersed with degraded\nigneous outflows that form heavy clay \u201cblack cotton\u201d soils (40-60% clay). The project area is\nbisected by multiple volcanic intrusions that remain as a series of mountain ranges (Mathews and\nMukugodo) exceeding 2500 m elevation, and is interspersed with lava flows of various ages that\nfeature either rocky cinder soils not suitable for storing carbon, or \u201cblack cotton\u201d clays which may\nstore significant carbon.\nIn the project area and in the project zone to the east, north, and west, vegetation of the sandy\nloam soils consists mostly of Acacia \u2013 Commiphora savannah grassland. In the project zone,\nseasonal dry forests occupy the slopes of the sky island mountain ranges, and cloud forests\noccupy the highest elevations of the mountains.\nv3.0 4\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION\nVCS Version 3, CCB Standards Second Edition\nSettlements inside the Conservancies are mostly small villages (< 500 people). Major\nsettlements outside the Conservancies include the towns of Isiolo and Archer\u2019s Post, and the\nregion is served by a newly completed (in 2011) tarmac road connecting Nairobi to Marsabit and\nthe Ethiopia and South Sudan borders. The area is a target for energy and tourism development\nby the recently elected Kenyan government http:\/\/allafrica.com\/stories\/201303182476.html."}]}
