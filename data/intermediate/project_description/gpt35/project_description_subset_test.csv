Project Description: VCS Version 4.2
Since there exists no delineation of project electricity system or connected electricity systems by
DNA, following criteria has been used to determine the existence of significant transmission
constraints:
• In case of electricity systems with spot markets for electricity: there are differences in
electricity prices (without transmission and distribution costs) of more than 5 percent
between the systems during 60 percent or more of the hours of the year.
• The transmission line is operated at 90% or more of its rated capacity during 90% percent
or more of the hours of the year.
Since the project output is fed to the Turkish electricity grid which does not involve any distinct
electricity systems that applies different price, first criteria defined above is not applicable. Also,
since the transmission line between the proposed projects and nearest substation is built within
the scope of the project and there exist no information on grid capacity utilization, second criteria
is also inapplicable. Based on assessment above, it is difficult to conclude with a significant
transmission constraint or grid boundary. Since there is no dispatch grid system in Turkey, the
project boundary is considered as the National Electricity Grid of Turkey according to applied tool.
The geographical and physical boundaries of the Turkish grid and location of the power plants are
well identified as given diagram below.

24,project_description,"2.1.1 Summary Description of the Project (G1.2)
This PDD presents a reference scenario for the Beampingaratsy REDD project, activities being
implemented as part of the project and a monitoring plan for the validation of the project.
The Beampingaratsy REDD Project is a REDD project, developed in the New Protected Area (NPA) of
Beampingaratsy in Madagascar, Anosy Region. The Beampingaratsy NPA is currently under creation in
partnership with the DSAP (Direction for Protected Area dependent of the Ministry of environment and
Forest). The project proponent of the Beampingaratsy REDD Project is the BNC REDD, the
administration in charge of the development of REDD mechanism in Madagascar and dependent of the
Ministry of environment and Forest. The Project is built on the experience of the HCPF Project, which has
implemented on the South part of the Project Area since 2008 with similar activities and objectives as
those of the Beampingaratsy REDD Project. HCPF Project has been financed by AFD (French Agency for
Development) since its beginning with a complement of AirFrance between 2008 and 2012. The
geographical scope evolved all along the different phases of the HCPF project until the focus on the
Beampingaratsy site for the next phase that will start in 2018 (same boundaries as the REDD Project).
The Beampingaratsy NPA and the climate and biodiversity components of the Project are led by Etc
Terra – Rongead, a French NGO also based in Madagascar. The agricultural activities will be led by
Agrisud International, also a French NGO with offices in Madagascar. The Project has the full support of
national government and of the Anosy Region and the management of the NPA will be supported by the
regional offices of the Ministry of Environment, the DREF Anosy.
The beginning or the official process to create the Beampingaratsy NPA marks the beginning of the
Beampingaratsy REDD Project as a main initiative to manage land in this area and a first activity to
enable a REDD Project elaboration. The forests inside the boundaries of the NPA (see Figure 12) are
considered to form the Project Area where the Project aims to decrease deforestation thanks to
agricultural support and land management. It was composed of 79,101 ha of humid forest in 2015
(which is therefore the size of the Project Area), before project start date (05-10-2017).
About 25,491 inhabitants live around the PA (see Table 1). Subsistence agriculture is their main
economic activity, with 98% of the population practicing it (see section 4.1.1). They cultivate cassava,
maize and rice either on rainfed or irrigated fields (located in valleys for the last). Main cause of
deforestation is the common practice of slash and burn agriculture (Figure 30). Agricultural activities are
leading to a mean historical deforestation level of 1,612 ha/yr in the reference region (RRD - Figure 24) of
the project, between 2005 and 2015. This rate is equivalent to a level of 515 ha/yr in the project area.
In order to reduce deforestation, the Beampingaratsy REDD project is developing several activities (see
section 2.1.11):
 Classify the Beampingaratsy forest under the status of New Protected Area to ensure the official
protection of massif;
 Support of the existing COBA in the management of the CBNRM transfer and on the provision of
services to communities;
CCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 17

CCB + VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION
CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3
 Provide alternatives to deforestation to local communities through a better management of the
territory with participative land use planning, construction of rural infrastructure such as irrigated
schemes, restoration of degraded lands, reforestation and to individual households through
ecological intensification and new income generating activities.;
 Support the emergence of services for farmers with the creation/strengthening of farmers
organizations, local private small enterprises or COBA and the structuration of suitable value
chain for the commercialization of cash crops;
 Contribution to decentralization process and to capacity building for Commune concerned by the
project through the development of forest services, Land Use plans and land tenure clarification
offices.
The objective is to reduce deforestation by 35% in average against the reference level during the first 5
years of project implementation and by 80% after 10 years. Until now, activities were funded by the AFD.
Once the REDD project is validated, the sale of carbon credits is expected to help financing part of the
activities implemented with the communities but other funds will be necessary.
The reference emissions level was calculated for the 2005-2010-2015 period (Reference Period) with
multiplication of activity data and emissions factors. Deforestation and biomass burning are considered as
sources of GHG emissions and only carbon stocks changes in Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and Below
Ground Biomass (BGB) tree pools are considered. The baseline of the project was established using the
VM0007 methodology. Areas of deforestation for the reference period (2005-2015) were assessed with
a multi-dates analysis of Landsat images that allows classification of land cover and land cover changes
(LCLCC) with a satisfactory accuracy (section 3.2.1.1).
For pre- (3 humid forest strata) and post-deforestation class, emissions factors were established using the
results of a carbon stocks map realized with a LiDAR flyover on a part of PA (Asner et al., 2012 – see
section 3.2.1.2). Average pre-deforestation carbon stocks used are 22 tC/ha for low forest, 111 tC/ha for
medium forest and 75 tC/ha for high forest (the 3 forest strata) and post-deforestation stocks are
10 tC/ha. According to the methodology used, after deforestation event, all aboveground tree biomass is
considered as emissions while belowground tree biomass is emitted with a default rate of 10% per year.
Expected emissions reduction were calculated as the difference between estimated baseline emissions
and emissions calculated in the project case (monitoring of deforestation areas), both for the Project Area
(PA) and the Leakage Belt (LB). Additional emissions (against LB baseline) in LB will be deduced from
the emissions reductions. Results for the first 10 years are expected emissions reduction of
145,901 tCO eq (section 3.2.4). Non-permanence risk of emissions reduction was evaluated following the 2
methodology requirements. It was used to estimate the size of the buffer to set-aside credits in order to
compensate this risk and it results to 11%.
The targeted general benefits for the communities are the following:
 Food security will be ensured thanks to better management of soil fertility with agroecology
techniques, which will enable to increase and diversify the food production and favor a wider
choice of diet.
CCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 18

CCB + VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION
CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3
 Technical support (agro-ecology) and advices on cash crops (cultivation, value chain
structuration, organization of agricultural service providers) will increase and diversify households’
incomes. This will contribute to local capacity building.
 Climate vulnerability of community will also be reduced with sustainable agricultural techniques
(agroforestry and reduction of deforestation) such as the presence of tree which positively impact
water availability.
 The availability of essential forest resources will be maintained or improved, through more
sustainable agricultural practices (conservation of forest cover), the protection of Beampingaratsy
forest (NPA) with a sustainable management plan for the use of NTFP (developed together with
communities) and work around long term land use planning;
 The support to existing COBA for the proposition of basic services and to communes for the
elaboration of land use management plan and development of forest services will contribute to
improve human and social capitals by capacity building of local communities and representatives,
the provision of basic services (education, health, services). The same will be achieve with the
participatory development of land use management plans.
 Finally the creation of land tenure offices and the participatory development of land use
management plans will contribute to securing land tenure, especially for those groups that have a
difficult access to lands outside forest which increases their dependency to slash and burn
agriculture.
Net project benefits for communities are summarized in Table 33.
In the without-project scenario, biodiversity is affected by progressive decrease of forest cover due to
slash and burn agriculture, non-controlled logging and the maintenance or increase of animal poaching (3
flora species and 14 fauna species were identified as threatened or endangered). On the contrary project
activities are expected to generate biodiversity benefits by the long-term protection of forest landscape,
which contributes to the preservation and enhancement of the faunal and floristic populations. Through
the long-term preservation of the Beampingaratsy forest cover thanks to the creation of the NPA, the
Project is expected to generate positive impacts on biodiversity by preserving habitats and floristic and
fauna species in the endangered landscape of humid forest of Madagascar. Moreover, the protection of
the forest corridor between the two National Parks of Andohahela and Midongy du Sud will guarantee the
maintenance of a large suitable habitat and the genes flow between wildlife populations. The elaboration
of a management plan which will guarantee the sustainability of local uses of forest: collection of NTFP,
forest exploitation for local construction and hunting. Reduce human activities that do not comply with the
conservation of biodiversity. Finally the monitoring system of the Project and the NPA will furnish valuable
data on local biodiversity that will contribute to improve the knowledge of this poorly studied region.",1743,1743_proj_desc_pl1743_19jan2018.pdf,project_description,{'project_country': 'Madagascar'},"What is the project province, country, latitude, and longitude of this project?","{'project_country': 'Madagascar', 'project_latitude': -24.16, 'project_longitude': 47.06}"

Additionality
According to the applied methodology AMS.II.G version 11.1, additionality may be demonstrated
using one of the following options specified by the methodology. Option 1 (positive list) was ruled
out as the penetration of ICS (in-situ and factory based model combined) was around 7.4% in the
year 2015.4 Similarly, since the project is prepared under the small scale threshold, the
application of Tool 19 as specified in option 3 was also ruled out. Hence, the additionality
assessment is conducted based on option 2 using Tool 21 “Demonstration of additionality of SSC
project activities”.
This project is voluntarily implemented by the developer as there is no mandatory legal provision
to be complied with in relation to the installation and use of ICS. Though proposed project has
disseminated 16,810 stoves which is within the small-scale threshold limit. All the stoves
distributed in the project has been implemented in the households using traditional cooking
stoves as the baseline cooking device operating at low efficiency thereby contributing to higher
consumption of the solid biomass and therefore the higher baseline GHG emissions attributable
to the non-renewable biomass.
Tool 21 version 13.1 specifies that the project additionality may be assessed with regards to one
of the four barriers; investment barrier, technological barrier, barrier due to prevailing practice
and other barriers outlined in para 10 of the tool. For the demonstration of additionality of the
proposed project the project participant has opted for investment barrier that prevents the project
to have been implemented without carbon revenue.
The proposed project has disseminated the cookstove units to the households free of cost and
there is no any other financial incentive for the implementation and use of such ICS. All the costs
related to stove construction, distribution, monitoring, project management, implementation
arrangement and carbon related costs will be covered from the carbon revenue that will be
generated as part of this project. The energy efficient cookstoves operate at efficiency greater
than 20% and hence is impactful when it comes to the reduction in firewood consumption and
therefore the mitigation of GHG. As the project implementation doesn’t result in any other form
of financial return, in absence of the project being developed as carbon project, the project would
not occur. Further, although the statistics suggest that the penetration of ICS is 7.4%, any
additional revenue that the project will be able to generate will be used to enhance access to
other users that are still relying on traditional cookstoves to meet their cooking energy
requirement. The likelihood of the existence of improve cooking stoves project in absence of the
carbon revenue is unlikely; hence, the investment barrier for the implementation of the project is
justified.

BaselineEmissions
AMS II.G/v11.1 requires that the project participants assume that in the absence of the project
activity, the baseline scenario would be the projected use of fossil fuels for meeting similar
thermal energy needs. The actual baseline scenario is the use of NRB. Since NRB has higher
carbon intensity than the fossil fuels proposed in AMS II.G, this assumption reduces the emission
reductions significantly, making the outcome more conservative. According to paragraph 24 of
methodology AMS II.G, emission reductions would be calculated as:

Determining fNRB,y
The applied methodology AMS-II.G version 11.1, para 13, refer to ‘Tool30: Calculation of the
fraction of non-renewable biomass (version 2.0)’ to calculate fNRB.
The fraction of woody biomass that can be established as non-renewable, is:
Where:
fNRB = Fraction of non-renewable biomass (fraction or %)
NRB = Quantity of non-renewable biomass (t/yr)
RB = Quantity of renewable biomass (t/yr)
NRB is calculated as below:
NRB = H - RB
Where, H is the total annual consumption of wood in the absence of the project activity which is
determined as per paragraph 12 (a) of the tool ‘Official statistics or reports or peer-reviewed
literature’.
Data endorsed by Ministry of Forest and Environment, Nepal dated 25 November 2018 is
considered for ‘H’ .
Renewable biomass (RB) in the country/region/area is estimated using the equation below:
Where:

MAIforest,i = Mean Annual Increment of woody biomass growth per hectare in subcategory i of
forest areas (t/ha/yr). This is calculated as per IPCC default value and considered as approved
by Ministry of Forest and Environment, Nepal dated 25 November 2018
MAIother,i = Mean Annual Increment of woody biomass growth per hectare in subcategory i of
other wooded land areas (t/ha/yr). This value is considered same as MAIforest,.
Fforest,i = Extent of forest in sub-category i (ha). This value is considered as per Ministry of Forest
and Environment, Nepal dated 25 November 2018.
Fother,i = Extent of other wooded land in sub-category i (ha). This value is considered as per
Ministry of Forest and Environment, Nepal dated 25 November 2018.
Pforest = Extent of non-accessible area (e.g. protected area where extraction of wood is
prohibited, geographically remote area) within forest areas (ha). This parameter is optional and
not considered.
Pother = Extent of non-accessible area (e.g. protected area where extraction of wood is
prohibited, geographically remote area) within other wooded land areas (ha). This parameter is
optional and not considered.
i = Sub-category i of forest areas and other wooded land areas
Total Annual Consumption of Wood (H): 128.00 Million ton/year(Estimated and endorsed by
Ministry of Forest and Environment, Government of Nepal)
Extent of forest in sub-category (Fforest,i): 5962038 hectares (State of Nepal's Forest, Table 7)

1. Social well-being
2. Economic well-being
3. Environmental well-being
4. Technological well-being
1. Social well-being
• The project site(s) in India are almost situated in an isolated rural area where unemployment,
poverty and other economic hardships are prevalent. Slow initiation of new investment in the
region is attributed to lack of supportive infrastructure, which can favour private investment.

The Puzhen Afforestation Project is located within Anshun City, in Guizhou Province. This province is
land locked and borders Yunnan to the west, Sichuan to the northwest, Hunan to the East and Chongqing
to the North. The population of the province is 34 million.
The Puzhen Afforestation Project (hereafter referred as “the Project”) is located within 2 counties;
Puding County and Zhenning County, The project is to plant native species on barren land for purposes
of GHG removal whilst contributing to local sustainable development goals. The project is implemented
jointly by Forestry Bureau of Puding County and Forestry Bureau of Zhenning County.26,551ha of
forest was planted on degraded lands in these two counties.
The Project involves a total of 227 villages in 2 counties, with a total population of nearly 88,202 people.
All the barren lands for afforestation activities belong to the villagers and the village committees manage
the lands on behalf of the villagers. Guizhou Baiheng Fertilizer Co., Ltd (hereinafter referred to as
Guizhou Baiheng or Baiheng) has been fully authorized by all the village committees through a signed
contract to act as the project proponent to implement project implementation, management, monitoring
and to sell VCUs generated from the project. This enables Baiheng to consolidate the offset resources
into sizeable forestry offset projects. Baiheng will profit-share with the villagers from the sale of VCUs.
The implementation of the project activity has provided 19,900 jobs for local villagers, among which 70%
are women.
The project activity aims to:
- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate change;
- Enhance biodiversity conservation by increasing the connectivity of forests;
- Improve soil and water conservation in the Karst region and increase the forest cover;
- Generate income and job opportunities for local village communities.
There is no natural renewal and afforestation before the project, and all sites were covered by barren
land. The main species planted is Cypress which is the native species according to the baseline survey.
The implementation of the project would reduce GHG emissions amounting to 9,390,696 tCO e over the 2
next 30 years, with an average annual GHG emission of 313,023 tCO e. 2

2 Physically distinct units are those that are capable of generating electricity without the operation of
existing units, and that do not directly affect the mechanical, thermal, or electrical characteristics of the
existing facility. For example, the addition of a steam turbine to an existing combustion turbine to create
a combined cycle unit would not be considered “physically distinct”.

Sectoral Scope : 1 – Energy industries (renewable / non renewable sources)
Project Type : I – Renewable Energy Projects
Project Category : I. D. – Grid connected renewable electricity generation
(Version 17, EB 61)
Technology/ measure
This category comprises renewable energy generation units, such as photovoltaics, hydro, tidal/wave,
wind, geothermal and renewable biomass that supply electricity to a national or a regional grid. As the
proposed project activity is the implementation of a solar photovoltaic project that supplies electricity to
grid, hence it falls under this category.
Technical description
The project activity is solar photovoltaic based power generation project. The total installed capacity of
the Solar PV power project is 10 MWp. 20 numbers of “500KWp” inverters are installed at the plant site
to convert the DC (Direct Current) power to AC (Alternate Current) Power.
The proposed plant will be predominantly south oriented and layout with PV panel of Multicrystalline
technology.
Photovoltaic module consists of several photovoltaic cells connected by circuits and sealed in and
environmentally protective laminate, which forms the fundamental building blocks of the complete PV
generating unit. Several PV panels mounted on a frame and grouped are termed as PV Array.
The DC electric power generated by the photo voltaic modules will be converted into 0.3 kV, 50Hz, AC
power by inverters, which will be stepped up to 11 kV through a set of transformers located in a
distributed manner all over the plant. From the outgoing side of the transformers, power will be
transmitted through a set of cable feeders to 11 kV indoor switchboard panel in a centrally located grid
interface substation. In the substation, the total power generated will be stepped up to 66 kV by 12500
kVA capacity power transformer with its associated 66 kV outdoor switch gear for interconnection to
the 66 kV transmission line of GETCO.
The project is a Renewable Energy project which displaces the electricity from the Grid that is
dominated by carbon intensive fossil fuel. The electricity generation from the project activity is an
environmentally safe and sound power generation technology.
The project activity used the reliable and proven technology available locally to ensure that an
environmentally safe technology is only being implemented in the proposed project activity.
The modules that installed in the project activity are Poly crystalline (230 Wp) modules. The technology
is well proven and safe. The other equipments installed in the project activity like Inverters, Junction
Box & Transformers are also well proven and safe.

2 APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY
2.1 Title and Reference of Methodology
The following UNFFCC methodology and its related tools are utilised:
Approved consolidated baseline and monitoring methodology ACM0002 “Consolidated baseline
methodology for grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources.” Version 13.0.0.
The Approved Methodology refers to the following tools:
“Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality” (Version 06 )
“Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system”. (Version 02.2.1)
""Tool to calculate project or leakage CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion"" (Version 02).
2.2 Applicability of Methodology
The methodology ACM0002 (Version 13.0.0) is applicable to the proposed project activity
because the proposed project meets all the applicability criteria stated in the methodology:
The methodology is applicable under the following conditions:
• “The project activity is the installation, capacity addition, retrofit or replacement of a
power plant/unit of one of the following types: hydro power plant/unit (either with a run-
of-river reservoir or an accumulation reservoir), wind power plant/unit, geothermal power
plant/unit, solar power plant/unit, wave power plant/unit or tidal power plant/unit;
• In the case of capacity additions, retrofits or replacements (except for wind, solar, wave
or tidal power capacity addition projects which use Option 2 on page 10 (of the ACM0002
(version 13.0.0)). to calculate the parameter EG ): the existing plant started PJ,y
commercial operation prior to the start of a minimum historical reference period of five
years, used for the calculation of baseline emissions and defined in the baseline emission
section, and no capacity expansion or retrofit of the plant has been undertaken between
the start of this minimum historical reference period and the implementation of the project
activity;”
The proposed project activity fits to first condition stated above as it is the installation of a new
power plant at a site where no renewable power plant was operated prior to the implementation of
the project activity (greenfield plant).
“In case of hydro power plants:
• One of the following conditions must apply:
v3.0 14

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
o The project activity is implemented in an existing single or multiple reservoirs, with no
change in the volume of any of reservoirs; or
o The project activity is implemented in an existing single or multiple reservoirs, where
the volume of any of reservoirs is increased and the power density of each reservoir,
as per the definitions given in the Project Emissions section, is greater than 4 W/m2;
or
o The project activity results in new single or multiple reservoirs and the power density
of each reservoir, as per the definitions given in the Project Emissions section, is
greater than 4 W/m2.”
In case of Damlapınar HPP, there is only a regulator that rises the water level to transfer the
water to the water conveying system. At the maximum operation level of 689.30 m water level the
total extend of the area that is flooded by river is 467,465.40 m2 therefore the power density is
calculated to be 35 W/m2, which is much greater than 4W/ m2.
“In case of hydro power plants using multiple reservoirs where the power density of any of the
reservoirs is lower than 4 W/m2 all the following conditions must apply:
• The power density calculated for the entire project activity using equation 5 (provided in
the methodology) is greater than 4 W/m2;
• Multiple reservoirs and hydro power plants located at the same river and where are
designed together to function as an integrated project that collectively constitute the
generation capacity of the combined power plant;
• Water flow between multiple reservoirs is not used by any other hydropower unit which is
not a part of the project activity;
• Total installed capacity of the power units, which are driven using water from the
reservoirs with power density lower than 4 W/m2, is lower than 15MW;
• Total installed capacity of the power units, which are driven using water from reservoirs
with power density lower than 4 W/m2, is less than 10% of the total installed capacity of
the project activity from multiple reservoirs.”
The proposed project activity does not have multiple reservoirs so the above conditions are not
applicable and the project activity is eligible.
“The methodology is not applicable to the following:
• Project activities that involve switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources at
the site of the project activity, since in this case the baseline may be the continued use of
fossil fuels at the site;
• Biomass fired power plants;
v3.0 15

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
• A hydro power plant that results in the creation of a new single reservoir or in the
increase in an existing single reservoir where the power density of the power plant is less
than 4 W/m2. “
The proposed project activity does not involve switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy
sources at the site of the project activity, is not a biomass fired plant, is not a hydro power plant
that results in the creation of a new single reservoir or in the increase in an existing single
reservoir where the power density of the power plant is less than 4 W/m2, there fore the project
activity is eligible to implement the ACM0002 version 13.0.0
“In the case of retrofits, replacements, or capacity additions, this methodology is only applicable if
the most plausible baseline scenario, as a result of the identification of baseline scenario, is “the
continuation of the current situation, i.e. to use the power generation equipment that was already
in use prior to the implementation of the project activity and undertaking business as usual
maintenance”.
The project is not a retrofit, replacement or capacity addition so the above condition is not
applicable,
In addition, Damlapınar HPP meets the applicability conditions included in “Tool for the
demonstration and assessment of additionality” (Version 6.0.0) and “Tool to calculate the
emission factor for an electricity system” (Version 2.2.0) referred below, the following reasons
justify the applicability of the methodological tools:
• “Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality” (Version 6.0.0) is required to
apply for demonstrating and assessing the additionality of a project activity in ACM0002
(Version 13.0.0).
According to the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system” (Version 2.2.0),
“This tool may be applied to estimate the OM, BM and/or CM when calculating baseline
emissions for a project activity that substitutes grid electricity, i.e. where a project activity supplies
electricity to a grid.” Accordingly, Damlapınar HPP will supply electricity to the Turkish National
Grid, and therefore this tool can be used to estimate the OM, BM and CM of calculating baseline
emissions.
2.3 Project Boundary
Table 5 exhibits the gases included in the project boundary. CO2 emission is included in the
baseline but the project activity does not emit any of the gases listed, in Table 5.
The project boundary includes net electricity generated and supplied to the Turkish national grid.
The internal consumption and the GHG due to the temporary use and burning of the diesel fuel
by the auxiliary power generators.

The Haidong Afforestation Project (hereafter “the project”) is located in Haidong City, Qinghai
Province of China, whose aim is to increase carbon sequestration and contribute to local
sustainable development by planting trees on the barren or degraded lands. The project
proponent is Qinghai Forestry Ecological Construction and Investment Co., Ltd.
12,849.00 ha (192,735 Mu12) of forest is to be planted by direct planting on degraded lands in
Haidong City, including 2 districts and 4 counties: Pingan District, Ledu District, Minhe County,
Huzhu County, Hualong County and Xunhua County. All the project sites were previously
degraded grassland and barren land. There is no natural renewal and reforestation before the
project.
The implementation of the project would generate GHG emission removals and improve local
environment through growing of the trees, increase income of local residents by offering job
opportunities from the project, enhance the capabilities of local communities and residents by
providing their relevant technical skills and training, and increase local biodiversity as a result of
establishing a forest of native trees (Picea crassifolia, Sabina przewalskii, Pinus tabulaeformis,
Populus, Betula and Ulmus).

Xinjiang Yining Sustainable Grassland Management Project (hereafter as “the project”) is located
in Yining County, Yili Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. The
project is aimed to restore the local degraded grassland ecosystem from adoption of sustainable
grassland management practices, such as improving the rotation of grazing animals, limiting the
timing and number of grazing animals on degraded pastures, and ensuring appropriate
management over the long-term. The project proponent is Yining County State-owned Investment
Capital Management limited liability Company.
The main restoration measure rest and rotational grazing were implemented in 266,666.78 ha of
degraded grassland where the theoretical animal capacity is about 521.3 thousand sheep which
was decreased by 51.15% compared with the non-degraded grassland data in 200313. The project
area is categorized into two groups. The first group of grassland will undergo sustainable grassland
management practices, which include implementing rotational grazing in different pastoral areas.
This approach involves limiting the duration and number of grazing activities in the project area to
protect the natural resources of the grassland and prevent further deterioration of the ecological
environment. In contrast, the second group of grassland will experience a prohibition on grazing
during the first five years of the project. After this initial period, sustainable grassland management
methods will be applied. These methods involve reducing grazing time by dividing the grasslands
into seasonal grazing areas, determined by the carrying capacity of the grassland and the
construction of fences. Specific guidelines, such as designated grazing orders, grazing cycles, and
zoning for grazing time, will be followed to ensure that the grassland is grazed systematically, area
by area, in a rotational manner.
In addition to the main restoration measures, the project incorporates various grassland
management measures aimed at mitigating soil desertification, restoring grassland vegetation,
enhancing soil carbon storage, and promoting local biodiversity. These additional measures include
initiatives such as rodent and pest control, as well as grassland fire prevention. By implementing
these additional measures, the project aims to ensure the long-term sustainable management of
the project area, mitigate soil desertification, restore grassland vegetation, and ultimately contribute
to the improvement of soil carbon storage and the preservation of local biodiversity.
According to the baseline survey, before the implementation of the project, the grassland in the
project area was facing serious degradation and even desertification due to the impact of climate
change and human activities. The project is estimated to generate GHG emission removals of
5,097,316 tCO e in 20 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 254,866 tCO e. 2 2
The objectives of the project including:
⚫ Climate: Restore the degraded grassland ecosystem, increase grassland coverage, increase
grassland carbon sink function, and reduce GHG emissions.

 Promotes self employment among the unemployed youth (eg. civil contractors,
spare parts shops, hotels, restaurants, security personneletc.,)
 Connectivity improvements in the local area through improved local
transportation.
Environmental Impacts:
The environmental footprint of Wind Turbine Generators is minimal, since:
 Wind is one of the cleanest forms of renewable energy and power generation
does not involve any fossil fuels.
 Produces electricity without GHG emissions.
 The materials used in the WTGs are non hazardous in nature.
 Impact on land, air and water is nil, since there are no discharges or Emissions
during the project lifetime.
Technological Impacts:
There are continuous research and development on the geometry of the wind blades,
height of towers, diameters of towers etc., which improves well for the technological
well being in the development of wind energy to produce clean electricity.
Also, the generated electricity from the project activity is connected to the grid. The
project activity improves the supply of electricity with clean, renewable wind power
while contributing to the regional/local economic development. Wind energy plants
provide local distributed generation, and provide site-specific reliability and
transmission and distribution benefits including:
 improved power quality;
 reactive power control;
 mitigation of transmission and distribution congestion,
All the above are the contributions of the project activity for the sustainable
development.

2.2 Applicability of Methodology
This project falls under the “Type I: Renewable Energy Projects,” and sub-category “I.C: Thermal
energy production with or without electricity” (Version 19).
This project involves the switch from a fossil fuel (coal) based thermal generation system to a
biomass fuelled thermal generation system. The energy produced by the project activities from
biomass is used for thermal steam generation and consumed by the project customers in
adjacent facilities. No electricity is generated by the steam produced by the project at this time,
but the generation capacity qualifies the project as small scale methodology.
Therefore, the applicable category for this project is Appendix B, AMS-I.C. – “Thermal energy
production with or without electricity” under “Type I. Renewable Energy Projects” as mentioned in
appendix B of the simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale CDM Project activities.
The choice of the methodology is accurate for this project and is justifiable since the project
activity meets the applicability conditions as summarized in Table 2.2.

1.5 Project Proponent
The project co-proponents are BEPC and MTI. BEPC’s owns 107 turbines (161.5 MW) of the
Crow Lake site and MTI owns 1 turbine (1.5 MW).
BEPC is a not-for-profit, wholesale electric generation and transmission cooperative based in
North Dakota that is owned by 131 rural distribution companies in 9 states (MT, MN, IA, SD,
ND, CO, NM, NB, WY) that provide electricity to 3 million customers. Basin’s charter is to
provide low cost, reliable electric power to its owner/members. BEPC incorporated a wholly
owned subsidiary PrairieWinds SD1 (PWSD1) to develop the Crow Lake Wind project which it
subsequently merged into BEPC. BEPC is also purchasing the power and the environmental
benefits generated by the MTI turbine.
MTI opened in 1968 as part of a post-high school vocational technical education system in
South Dakota that included four area institutes and the South Dakota Office of Adult,
Vocational and Technical Education. The central mission of the Institute is to provide job
preparatory programs on a full- or part-time basis to all who can benefit. MTI’s turbine is used
as a teaching tool for students in its wind turbine technician program and is operated by BEPC.

Outcome of Substep 1b: : List of plausible alternative land use scenarios to the A/R project activity
that are in compliance with mandatory legislation and regulations taking into account the their
enforcement in the region or country and EB decisions on national and/or sectoral policies and
regulations
Land Use Scenario a: Unproductive pastureland
Land Use Scenario b: Commercial cattle grazing
Land Use Scenario c: Agricultural production
Land Use Scenario d: Reforestation through direct planting without registration as a VCS Project
Land Use Scenario e: Reforestation through human-assisted natural regeneration without registration
as a VCS Project
Sub-step 1c. Selection of the baseline scenario:
Section 2.4 “Description of how the baseline scenario is identified and description of the identified
baseline scenario”of the VCS PD was used to identify the most likely baseline scenario. Using this
stepwise approach the most plausible baseline scenario is the continuation of the existing land use:
unproductive pastureland.
Step 2. Investment analysis
N/A. For the Campo Verde project, barrier analysis is performed as a stand-alone additionality
analysis.
Step 3. Barrier analysis70
The proposed project activities face barriers that prevent the implementation of the proposed project
activity. The barriers for both project activities: A/R through direct planting and A/R through assisted
natural regeneration face the same barriers and therefore the analysis is presented together.
However, the most likely baseline scenario, unproductive pastureland, does not face any barriers to
implementation.
The Campo Verde project had been looking for a financial partner for approximately 3 years before
SFM became involved. As documented below, the project undertook several efforts to raise finance
from a variety of sources, all of them unsuccessful until SFM agreed to finance the reforestation
activities. SFM’s financing has been provided on an all equity basis as conventional bank finance was
not available.
Sub-step 3a. Identify barriers that would prevent the implementation of type of the proposed project
activity:
Investment Barriers:
Debt funding is not available for long-term reforestation projects in Peru. Reforestation through direct
planting or assisted natural regeneration requires considerable investment in the initial years to
implement the project; namely negotiations with stakeholders to expel grazing animals, the funding
of nursery development, planting costs, maintenance, fire prevention and fire fighting. Returns are
generated only in the long-term. Consequently reforestation projects require considerable up-front
financing, with only long-term returns for investors. The project’s risk-adjusted return to investors is
not appealing to local or international investors. One of the main risks is that there is a lack of
commercial demonstration of the growth and yield of native species plantations or of assisted natural
regeneration. Therefore, making the risk-adjusted return to investors unattractive.

VCS Project Description – Campo Verde
Public funding for reforestation activities in the Ucayali region is almost nonexistent. In the 2008
Ucayali’s budget, funding for reforestation projects of native species was not considered while
funding for reforestation of fast-growth species and for the recovery of degraded areas sums S/.
780,000 (seven hundred and eighty thousand Nuevos Soles) less than 1% of Ucayali’s budget.71
Funding from commercial banks is very limited as well. According to the USAID report Rural and
Agricultural Finance: Emerging Practices from Peruvian Financial Institutions, “the formal financial
system in Peru, all entities regulated by the Superintendency of Banks and Insurance, provides very
limited rural and agricultural finance services and most financial institutions focus uniquely on serving
urban clients”.72
The banks that do provide rural and agricultural finance require a repayment period not longer than 3
years73. Moreover, COFIDE, the government sponsored Peruvian development bank, offers funding
for projects for up to 10 years only74.
As an example, efforts were made by BAM to access debt funding for a period of three years
unsuccessfully. Details of the efforts to secure funding by project proponents are provided in Step 5
below.
Technological Barrier:
Since afforestation is not a common practice, access to planting materials such as seedlings for
projects on a commercial scale is limited in the region. This substantially increases the costs required
to produce seedlings. Although plantation development in Peru had been advocated by the
Reforestation Committee – INRENA, after the Committee was closed existing plantations were
abandoned.
Prevailing Practice Barrier
Reforestation through direct planting or assisted natural regeneration is not commonly practiced in
the Pucallpa region. According to INRENA,75 for the period 2001-2006, only 196 hectares have been
reforested in Ucayali Region. In the 1980’s the Reforestation Committee of IRENA worked to promote
plantations in local communities. However, the growth of the planted trees was not monitored and
most plantations were not successfully established.
Plantation development has always been advocated by the Comite de Reforestation, a program under
the authority of INRENA. The Comite was concerned about the establishment of the plantations
mainly, but not about the maintenance of them. After the program was closed, plantations were
abandoned by almost all of the communities and farmers that were associated with the project. For
instance according to ITTO, in Peru “between 1997 and 2000 Prosopis was sown over more than
400,000 hectares to thicken sparse woody formations and to establish new woody cover where there
was none before. However, it is estimated that only 10% survived.”76
Currently, a combination of fires, grazing, and an invasive grass species prevents reforestation
through natural regeneration. The fires are anthropogenic and are initiated outside the proposed

Spatial analysis was conducted with the IDRISI SELVA software (Eastman 2011), and the Land Change
Modeler (LCM) which is an integrated software environment. LCM is a spatially-explicit modeling tool that
was used to model the location of deforestation projected in the baseline for both the project area and
leakage belt. LCM was developed by Clark Labs in conjunction with the Andes Center of Biodiversity
Conservation of Conservation International, and has been tested extensively in the South America (Clark
labs 2007). LCM provides a wide range of tools organized in a series of steps for analyzing land cover
change; modeling potential for change; predicting change and validating results. For this analysis, LCM
was used to produce a vulnerability map of the project area and leakage belt. Translation of the
vulnerability map into a scenario map of deforestation through the project term was conducted with a rank
and assign operation. This model meets the criteria of (1) being peer-reviewed, (2) transparent, (3)
incorporating spatial datasets used to explain patterns of deforestation, and (4) is capable of projecting
the location of future deforestation (Kim 2010, Sangermano et al., 2010, Eastman et al., 2005).46
All spatial modeling analysis is performed on the reference region for projecting location of deforestation
(RRL). The RRL is defined in section 3.1.1 and encompasses the area surrounding the project area and
leakage belt (see Figure 3.1). Information from the reference region is analyzed under a spatially explicit
modeling framework to construct future scenarios of how deforestation can be allocated in the reference
region. In conformance with the VCS modular REDD methodology VM0007, location analysis was
conducted since the initial configuration of the RRL landscape was a frontier configuration.",1113,1113_proj_desc_1113_09jul2014.pdf,project_description,No relevant information found in context,"What is the project province, country, latitude, and longitude of this project?","{'project_state_province': 'northern bank of the Valparaiso River', 'project_country': 'Brazil', 'project_latitude': -8.12, 'project_longitude': -72.61}"

Contribution of the project to sustainable development
Ministry of Environment and Forests, Govt. of India has
stipulated the social well being, economic well being,
environmental well being and technological well being as
the four indicators for sustainable development.
Social Well-being
The project produces power from cleaner source i.e., wind
energy. The project leads to employment of local people
which provides boost to local economy. The project helps
to reduce demand supply gap in electricity in the state.
The project has led to rural upliftment and infrastructure
development in the areas around the project such as
13

VCS Project Description
improving the condition of roads connecting to the project
site.
Environmental Well-being
The project utilizes wind energy for generating
electricity which otherwise would have been generated
through alternate fuels (most likely -fossil fuel) based
power plants, contributing to reduction in emissions
including GHG emissions. Being a renewable resource, using
wind energy to generate electricity contributes to
resource conservation. Thus the project causes no negative
impact on the surrounding environment contributing to
environmental well-being.
Economic Well-being:
The project creates job opportunities for local people
during construction and operation period. The project
provides business opportunity for local stakeholders such
as suppliers, manufacturers, contractors etc. There is
demand-supply gap in the grid; the project helps in
reducing the gap by pumping the electricity produced into
the local grid.
Technological Well Being:
