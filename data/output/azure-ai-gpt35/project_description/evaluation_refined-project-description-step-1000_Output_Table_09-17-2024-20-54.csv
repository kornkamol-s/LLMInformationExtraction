VCS Project Description Template
Sub-step 2b. – Option III. Apply benchmark analysis
A suitable financial indicator, post tax project IRR has been identified to demonstrate the
investment barriers faced by the project. The post tax IRR of the project has been compared
with the local commercial lending rates prevailing during the time of investment.
Suitability of the Benchmark used for Comparison:
The guidance to investment analysis issued in EB 51 (paragraph 12) states that in cases where
a benchmark approach is used, the applied benchmark shall be appropriate to the type of IRR
calculated. Local commercial lending rates are appropriate benchmarks for the project IRR.
Required/expected returns on equity are appropriate benchmarks for equity IRR.
The tool for demonstration and assessment of additionality [para-5, sub step 2(b)] states that
in cases where the project has more than one potential developer, the benchmark shall be
based on parameters that are standard in the market, considering the specific characteristics of
the project type. Accordingly, local commercial lending rates applicable to the project type
have been considered as the benchmark and thus we have considered the Prime Lending Rate
(PLR) of five major banks in India as published by RBI as the appropriate benchmark.
Purchase Orders were placed in the months of May, August & September 2007 .The PLR, are
the same for the 3 months and thus we have considered 13 % as the appropriate benchmark.
Please refer to the benchmark excel sheet.
Sub-step 2c. Calculation and comparison of financial indicators (only applicable to options
II and III):
Calculate the suitable financial indicator for the proposed CDM project activity and, in the
case of Option II above, for the other alternatives. Include all relevant costs (including, for
example, the investment cost, the operations and maintenance costs), and revenues (excluding
CDM revenues, but including subsidies/fiscal incentives where applicable), and, as
appropriate, non-market cost and benefits in the case of public investors.
Present the investment analysis in a transparent manner and provide all the relevant
assumptions in the CDM-PDD, so that a reader can reproduce the analysis and obtain the
same results. Clearly present critical techno-economic parameters and assumptions (such as
capital costs, fuel prices, lifetimes, and discount rate or cost of capital). Justify and/or cite
assumptions in a manner that can be validated by the DOE. In calculating the financial
indicator, the project’s risks can be included through the cash flow pattern, subject to project-
specific expectations and assumptions (e.g. insurance premiums can be used in the calculation
to reflect specific risk equivalents).

Assumptions and input data for the investment analysis shall not differ across the project
activity and its alternatives, unless differences can be well substantiated.
Present in the CDM-PDD submitted for validation a clear comparison of the financial
indicator for the proposed CDM activity and:
The alternatives, if Option II (investment comparison analysis) is used. If one of the other
alternatives has the best indicator (e.g. highest IRR), then the CDM project activity can not be
considered as the most financially attractive;
The financial benchmark, if Option III (benchmark analysis) is used. If the CDM project
activity has a less favourable indicator (e.g. lower IRR) than the benchmark, then the CDM
project activity cannot be considered as financially attractive.

The approved CDM methodology ACM0009 “Consolidated baseline and monitoring methodology for fuel
switching from coal or petroleum fuel to natural gas” (version 4.0.0) is applied. In the following the
applicability criteria are provided and it is explained how each of it is met (this is equal as for the eligibility
criteria and the same references are used):
EC-01: This methodology is applicable to project activities that switch in one or several element
processes from coal or petroleum fuel to natural gas. The fuel switching is undertaken in
processes for heat generation that are located at and directly linked to an industrial process with
a main output other than heat or that provide heat to a district heating system by means of heat-
only boilers.
EC-02: Prior to the implementation of the project activity, only coal or petroleum fuel (but not
natural gas) have been used in the element processes.
EC-03: Regulations/programs do not constrain the facility from using the fossil fuels being used
prior to fuel switching.

[['INSTANCE 01', 'The boilers before and after fuel switching are the same. They are not modified in a\nway that would increase capacity and no new boilers are installed. The steam\nproduction capacity is not altered by the project implementation.

This project will generate electricity from renewable source (wind) and it will supply
electricity to grid. Being a renewable source of energy, the project falls under
UNFCCC guideline for small scale project activity in category I. D, ‘Grid connected
renewable electricity generation’. The electricity generated displaces fossil fuel based
electricity thereby increasing the renewable component of electricity in the grid mix.
This leads to reduction of fossil fuel usage in electricity generation.

The baseline emissions determined is, electricity produced (kWh) by the project
activity is multiplied by grid emission factor of the NEWNE regional grid (measured
in kg CO e/kWh). The project also applies the ""Tool to calculate the emission factor 2
for an electricity system” version 01.1 in calculating the NEWNE grid emission
factor. The emission factor (EF ) of the grid has been calculated as a combined y
margin (CM), consisting of the combination of operating margin (OM) and build
margin (BM) according to the procedures prescribed in the tool.
The baseline emission (BE in tCO e) of the project activity is calculated as shown y 2
below:
BE = EG * EF y y y
Where:
BE = Baseline emission in year y (tCO e/yr) y 2
EG = is the net quantity of electricity supplied by the project in year y, (MWh) y

The Triunfo do Xingu Grouped REDD+ Project's area is situated in Altamira municipality, Pará state, Brazil.
This municipality is 832 km far from Belém, the capital of the state of Pará. Its estimated population,
based on the IBGE estimates of 2021, is around 117 thousand inhabitants, and its territorial area
averages 160 thousand square kilometers, equivalent to 1,6 x 109 hectares.
Following the VCS Methodology VM0015 v1.1 (VERRA, 2012a), the project area may only include areas
composed of forest for a minimum of ten years prior to the project start date, a definition that also
includes secondary forests. Therefore, satellite images between 2012 and 2022, were analyzed and
classified and the areas within the property that were defined as forests were separated and utilized to
compose the project area. In addition, some non-forest areas were also excluded, such as rivers, rocks,
and non-forest vegetation.
The definition used for forest areas is the one given by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (Ramírez & Morales, 2021): “land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5
meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It
does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use”.
Table 1.9 contains the location of each property part of the TdX-I1, it also describes the size of total
property area and eligible forest area.

Section 7 Additionality
Within the Project Area, none of the proposed Project activities violate any law.
1. Identification of alternative land use scenarios
a. Continuation of the pre-project land use as private wildlife sanctuary:
Prior to the implementation of the REDD project on Rukinga, the Project proponents had
spent a significant and unsustainable amount of money over the last ten years financing
activities to attempt to protect the forest from destruction. Those activities provided no
significant sources of income from the land to offset the land protection costs, and
therefore this project would eventually have failed financially if carbon funding were not
made available.
b. Uses a in the ten years prior to Project start date:
Cattle Ranching - When the current majority landowners acquired their interest in
Rukinga Sanctuary in 2000, the previous owners were operating a financially
unsuccessful cattle ranching operation on the land. The area is too dry with no
permanent water for successful cattle ranching, and there was predation by lions on the
cattle at a rate that lead to the financial failure of the operation, and eventual sale of the
land to the majority shareholder of Wildlife Works.
Ecotourism - The prior owners also had an ecotourism facility on the Project area, but as
evidence that these activities were not financially viable on the land, the slash and burn
clearing had reached within 200 meters of the ecotourism facility, causing it to fail and
move away.
c. Slash and Burn Agriculture by subsistence farmers:
Prior to the Project Proponent taking over management of the land in 2005, local people
had begun to clear part of the Project area, and have systematically cleared the dryland
forest from a majority of the Reference area in order to provide land for annual crops.
This is evidently the most likely Baseline scenario, as it had been carried out routinely
throughout the Reference region, in clear violation of land laws.
2. Consistency of credible land uses with enforced mandatory laws and regulations:
All of the alternative land use scenarios above represent legal land uses, with the exception of
slash and burn agriculture, which essentially consists of squatting on privately owned land; illegal
under Kenyan law. However, there is overwhelming evidence that this law had been
systematically unenforced, as greater than 30% of the area of the administrative unit that
encompasses the project area had been deforested in the ten years prior to the Project start date.
Thus, all the land uses above are credible.
3. Investment Analysis – Simple Cost Analysis:
Physical protection of the Project area, and provision of deforestation mitigation activities, such as
school building, scholarships, ranger patrols, reforestation of deforested indigenous forests etc.
for the community cost the Project Proponent approximately $300-400,000 per year in the years

Kasigau Corridor REDD Project Phase I – VCS PD Requirements
prior to implementation of the VCS AFOLU project. There exists no significant income to offset
these costs. In the absence of active protection, both physical and that created by partnering with
the communities to create economic alternatives, it is clear the land in the Project area would be
cleared aggressively for subsistence agriculture, as that was in fact what was already happening
prior to our arrival. Slash and burn agriculture faces no economic barriers, and is therefore once
again the most likely Baseline scenario.
4. Common Practice Analysis
It is common practice to protect wilderness in Africa, and to provide sustainable development
support for rural African communities, but that common practice is typically funded by
governments or donor agencies, and not by financial return from the project activities. It is NOT
common practice for private companies that are not donor funded, such as the Project proponent
to protect forested wilderness in Africa for financial return, in the absence of AFOLU revenues.
The Project proponent’s Rukinga Sanctuary project is the first AFOLU Project Activity of its type
in Kenya, and one of the very first in Africa.
Summary of Additionality Test
In summary;
 the Kasigau Corridor REDD project is not the only credible alternative land use consistent with
enforced mandatory applicable laws,
 one of those alternative land uses, that of Slash and Burn Agriculture is by far the most likely
baseline land use,
 the Kasigau Corridor project passes the Investment Analysis Test as it is not a financially viable
land use without the AFOLU VCS project revenues
 and the project activities are NOT common practice.
therefore it is additional under the rules of VT0001 Tool for the Demonstration of Additionality in VCS
AFOLU Project Activities.

Section 8 Baseline Emissions
Baseline emissions are calculated as the carbon pools measured in the project area, which are applied to
the cumulative deforestation model (determined by sampling historical imagery). The estimated emissions
(tonnes CO2e) for each selected carbon pool in the project area for each year since the project start date
are shown in the following table. The total estimated baseline emissions for the first monitoring period are
1,450,329 tonnes CO2e. These emissions are based on the selected linear predictor of cumulative
deforestation. It should be noted that it is not mandatory to measure ex-ante carbon stocks in the project
area according to VCS standards. However, Wildlife Works chose to verify the project at the same time as
project validation, and therefore performed a full ex-ante carbon inventory. The spreadsheet 'NER
Analysis v4, 01/25/2011' provides complete GHG emission analysis for the entire project crediting period,
and was provided to the Validator.

The Riau Ecosystem Restoration Carbon Project (the ""Project"", “RER-Project” or ""RER-CP"") seeks to
protect and restore 130,090 ha of peatland ecosystem located in the Republic of Indonesia while at
the same time preserving biodiversity and enhancing local livelihoods. The Project will secure
78,425 ha of forest from risk of conversion to an industrial forestry plantation. The Project is on the
island of Sumatra and in the Province of Riau. Specifically, it is located on the Kampar Peninsula,
which is a rain-fed domed peatland forest made up of four former logging concessions.
Figure 1- Landscape of project area (Copyright: C. Delacy ©)
The Kampar Peninsula (674,200 ha) was first subjected to commercial timber exploitation in the
1970s through the early 2000s. This phase was followd by a significant part of the peninsula being
designated for industrial plantations, primarily Acacia crassicarpa, and to a much lesser extent, oil
palm plantations. The remaining natural forest block (344,000 ha) on the Kampar Peninsula is the
largest peatland forest block in Sumatra with a peat depth that ranges from 3 – 15 meters thick. As
of 2014, when the RER area was completing its licensing, 294,227 ha or 43.6% of the peninsula
had been converted to Acacia forestry plantations. Today, approximately 344,000 ha of natural
forest remains on the Kampar Peninsula, and the RER-CP is located at the centre of this.
The Project at its heart is tasked with demonstrating how peat landscapes can be responsibly
managed to protect biodiversity and enhance local communities. Forest protection preservation is
augmented by the ring of Acacia plantations that surrounds the Project and which acts as a natural
buffer to the Project Area.
Page 17 of 404

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
The four original concessions that make up the Project area are PT. Gemilang Cipta Nusantara
(20,123 ha), PT. The Best One Unitimber (40,666 ha), PT. Sinar Mutiara Nusantra (32,776 ha) and
PT. Global Alam Nusantara (36,525 ha). All have long been gazetted as part of the Forest
Production Estate (Hutan Produksi) by the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry.
Through the acquisition of individual Ecosystem Restoration licenses (IUPHHK-RE) for each, they
have been saved from the risk of conversion to industrial plantations.
With more than 17,000 people living just outside the RER concession areas, it is essential that the
Project provides training and incentivises improved livelihood opportunities. The biodiversity of the
Kampar Peninsula has been recognised by Birdlife International, The International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and World Wildlife Fund
(WWF) as an “Important Bird Area” (2004), a “Key Biodiversity Area” (2006), and a “Tiger
Conservation Area“ (2007). Globally threatened species such as the Sumatran Tiger, Sunda
Pangolin, Storm’s Stork, Flat-head Cat, and Malaysian Sun Bear are known to exist in the Project
Area.
The carbon financing received from the Project's activities will be reinvested into the landscape and
local communities to support environmental restoration, fire monitoring, scientific peatland and
wetlands research, and preservation and conservation efforts to maintain and increase the
incredible flora and fauna of the Project Area. There are no ongoing incidents of significant
deforestation or forest degradation in the project area and unplanned deforestation and unplanned
degradation area excluded from both the baseline and the project scenarios.
Under the hypothetical business-as-usual plantation baseline, the landscape would have been
converted to Acacia plantations.
Through the assistance of carbon financing, the Project, over its initial lifespan of 57 years will avoid
373,116,864 tonnes of CO2e, (i.e. 6,545,910 tonnes of Co e per annum) from being emitted. At the 2
same time, the Project will ensure the delicate domed peat landscape remains intact, is not
converted to industrial plantations and undergoes rehabilitation (both natural and human-assisted).
The landscape will be rehabilitated further by blocking the legacy drainage canals from past
commercial selective so that the landscape is rewetted. The Project will ensure carbon remains
locked in the environment and that the biodiversity conservation of this unique lowland domed peat
swamp forest of Riau can be preserved for generations to come.","{'project_country': 'Indonesia'}","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","1","1","5","1","5","1","77","Completed"

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
The disturbance to the soil attributable to the project activity covers plough strips of 0,8 m width every
4 m to the effectively planted area, representing 13% of the total BDU II Trust Fund project area and
20% of the BDU II VCS project boundary area. Having said this, the soil types of the project cannot be
categorized as (i) organic or (ii) grassland in which soil disturbance is restricted. According to 2006
IPCC Guidelines (Annex 3A.5, Chapter 3, Volume 4), organic soils must have at least 12 percent organic
carbon by weight (i.e., about 20 percent organic matter). As it is described by Silva30 organic matter
content in brunosoles soils (from Coneat 2) range from 3.1 to 8.2%. In this soil type the organic matter
content, and hence the organic carbon, does not reach the 20% of the organic soils. Given that, as
above stated BDU project soils are classified as Coneat 2, it is concluded that the soil types of the
project are not organic.
BDU II project lands are characterized by grazing activity with regular usage capacity and without
technological improvements, implanted pastures or crops. These natural grasslands do not receive
intensive management with added agricultural inputs such as fertilization, reseeding, etc. The soils are
of reduced natural fertility and current erosion is relatively low. Hence, the Project is applicable to this
methodology.
A project activity applying this methodology shall also comply with the applicability conditions of the
tools contained within the methodology and applied by the project activity.
CDM project standard
This standard establishes a set of specific requirements for afforestation and reforestation project
activities, among which stands out the eligibility of the land.
In order to demonstrate the land eligibility, the PP should follow the “Procedures to Demonstrate the
Eligibility of Lands for Afforestation and Reforestation CDM Project Activities” in which Project
participants shall provide evidence that the land within the planned project boundary does not contain
forest and that the activity is a reforestation or afforestation project activity
The land eligibility is demonstrated though the use of satellite imagery showing that vegetation on the
land has been below the forest threshold according to the definition of forest adopted by Uruguay. In
this regard, the table below provides the details of the adopted definition31:
The satellite images displayed below show that the land did not contain forest on 31 December 1989
nor at the moment the project started in May 2012. As it can be seen the images obtained correspond

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
Regarding VCS eligibility requirements (AFOLU requirements, version 3.4, section 3.1.6), grassland
vegetation dominating before project start is not the native ecosystem of the land within project
boundaries. The native condition was modified by the introduction of beef cattle and sheep in the 17th
and 19th centuries, respectively, and by the introduction of exotic species during the last three
centuries.
Additionality Tool
The “Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality in A/R CDM project
activities” is applicable under the following conditions:
31

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
- Forestation of the land within the proposed project boundary performed with or without being
registered as the A/R CDM project activity shall not lead to violation of any applicable law even if the
law is not enforced.
- This tool is not applicable to small - scale afforestation and reforestation project activities.
These conditions are met by the proposed project activity. The project has received all required
approvals from the necessary local authorities to start the implementation and the project is
considered a large-scale afforestation.
Carbon stock of trees, shrubs, dead wood and litter
Tools “Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in A/R CDM project
activities” and “Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks in dead wood and litter in A/R
CDM project activities” do not establish applicability conditions.
Soil Organic Carbon Stock
The “Tool for estimation of change in soil organic carbon stocks due to the implementation of A/R CDM
project activities” is applicable when the baseline scenario and the project activity areas of land do not
fall into wetland category; contain organic soils are not grassland in which soil disturbance is
restricted. Also, when the proposed project activity meets the following conditions: Litter remains on
site and is not removed and soil disturbance, if any, is in accordance with appropriate soil conservation
practices.
Both the land features and the conservation practices applicability requirements are met by the project
making this tool applicable to it. The case of the land was previously discussed in this section.
In relation to the conservation practices (litter removal and soil disturbance) the project has obtained
the FSC certification in March 2016 implying that these conditions will are accomplished32. It is
important to mention that the land will be disturbed only once in the project lifetime in both cases. E.
grandis has only one rotation (18 years) and dunnii has two (9 years/each) but the second one will be
managed through a coppicing scheme without soil disturbances.
Emissions from Biomass Burning
The tool “Estimation of non-CO2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from burning of biomass
attributable to an A/R CDM project activity” is applicable to all occurrence of fire within the project
boundary and it mandates to calculate Non-CO2 GHG emissions provided that the accumulated area
affected by such fires in a given year is ≥5% of the project area.
As above mentioned, it is not applicable to the present project activity since biomass burning practices
will not be part of it.
Displacement of Agricultural Activities
The tool “Estimation of the increase in GHG emissions attributable to displacement of pre-project
agricultural activities in A/R CDM project activity”. is applicable to the present project activity since the
32 FSC certificate available for the VVB at validation.
32

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
displacement of agricultural activities is not expected to cause, directly or indirectly, any drainage of
wetlands or peat lands, as requested in the applicability condition of the tool.

The entire grouped project crediting period is 35 years from the project start. However, each
cohort will have a cohort crediting period of 30 year. This means there is a total of 5 cohorts with
each 30 years crediting period. There will be a digital Monitoring Validation and Reporting (dMRV)
every 5 years within one cohort but so that every year Urstamm will be monitoring and issuing
credits at to one of the cohorts.
The VCS Program requirements sets the project crediting period by a minimum of 20 years.
Therefore, the project fulfils the requirements ( on page 27) with a crediting period of 30 years.

The Grouped Project is located in the Oriental region of Paraguay, comprising the area with a
250 kilometers distance from the planned pulp mill site, The project is bordered by the left
banks of Paraguay River in the west and the border with Brasil in the north and east. The
Grouped Project will potentially figure into the departments of Concepción, Amambay, San

The region where PARACEL properties are located, has favourable and competitive conditions
for the growth of Eucalyptus plantations, as is already the case with plantations established in
Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. Paraguay's proximity to countries with a great tradition in
planted forests, such as Brazil and Argentina, favours the contribution of technology and
genetic materials for initial plantings and the genetic basis for the future development of
superior materials adapted to local conditions.

activity:
The project activity is electricity generation from wind energy which is a renewable resource.
The generated electricity is then exported to the NEWNE grid. The project hence can be
considered under “Grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources”. The
project activity has a capacity less than 15 MW (limit for small scale project). Therefore as
per the scope of the project activities enlisted in the list of sectoral scopes and related
approved baseline and monitoring methodologies, the project activity is a small scale project
and may principally be categorized as:
Sectoral Scope : 01
Project Type : Energy Industries (renewable / non-renewable sources)
Project category : D – Grid connected renewable electricity generation (AMS
I.D.,Version 15, EB -50)
Technology Used:
In wind energy generation, kinetic energy of wind is converted into mechanical energy and
subsequently into electrical energy. Wind has considerable amount of kinetic energy when
blowing at high speeds. This kinetic energy when it passes through the blades of the wind
turbines, it is converted into mechanical energy and rotates the wind blades. When the wind
blades rotate, the connected generator also rotates, thereby produce electricity.
The WEGs have high-speed asynchronous generator with a multi-stage intelligent switching
compensation system designed for high output efficiency. The technology is a clean
technology since there are no GHG emissions associated with the electricity generation. The
project installs 4 nos. (V82) Vestas make WEGs of 1.65 MW capacity each and 5 nos. of (S-
82) Suzlon make WEGs of 1.5 MW capacity each. Salient features of V-82 & S-82 WEGs are

Meters Above Sea Level (masl) for the cocoa agroforestry systems to a maximum of 2 500 MASL
for forest plantation. However, approximately 90% of the project will be developed between 300
masl and 1 500 masl.
These regions between 300m et 1500masl are known as the most suitable coffee and cocoa
production zones in the country, due to their similar ecological conditions (temperature,
precipitation and soil). Land use patterns in the project areas can be considered as
homogeneous. It comprises areas that are managed by producers’ members, the Cooperatives
(see section 1.4) and some independent small-scale producers who are joining the cooperative.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
The project is a grouped project. The partners of the project are located in 12 departments and 37
provinces of Peru, as shown in the following table:
Table 05. Geographic Location
The grouped project is made on a single geographic area for the inclusion of new instances as
defined by the VCS criteria. Indeed, the initial conditions that can influence the baseline scenario
and additionality (land use, socioeconomic conditions biophysical and ecological) are sufficiently
homogeneous throughout the scope of the project to justify this grouping. Small Peruvian
producers of coffee and cocoa, with whom we work, form a very homogeneous group with
respect to the management of their lands and plantations and their socioeconomic conditions.
Popular and current agricultural practices (such as ""slash and burn, Migratory agriculture, low
density and diversity in the use of shadow when used, etc.) are common to all. We use the same
unique geographic area for the non-permanence risk assessment.
v3.2 28

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
The geographic area within which new project activity instances may be developed is delimited by
the sphere of influence of the participating cooperatives:
Each cooperative has its producer members and performs these activities in a zone of influence.
Each of these geographic zones forms a unit for an implementing partner. In addition, producers
who are not related to a cooperative of the project but are located within the area of influence of a
cooperative may choose to become member and join the project. The following maps show areas
of cooperatives or central that are part of the SHADE COFFEE AND CACAO REFORESTATION
PROJECT. In some cases these territories may overlap. All these maps are stored in ArcGis, and
also joined in KML files, where each one is delimited by a geodetic polygons. Below are few
examples of maps of the territories covered by each cooperative. The complete list of these maps
is attached.

registering the UTM coordinates with horizontal projection WGS 1984 South. This information is
stored in our database (MINKA), processed in ArcGIS and identifies every instance of the project.

area in each of the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project
boundary:
(i) Land containing organic soils;
(ii) land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and
receives inputs listed in appendices 1 and 2 to the methodology.
The project land does not contain organic soils as demonstrated above. The project land does
not receive any inputs according to appendices 1 and 2 of the AR methodology (CDM), but is
subject to shifting agriculture. Because of long periods of fallow vegetation however, it is not
considered to be specific subject to land use.

This tool has no internal applicability conditions
Applicability conditions of the tool: “Tool for estimation of change in soil organic carbon stocks
Due to the implementation of A/R CDM project activities”, version 01.1.0
(a) The areas of land (i) do neither fall into the wetland category, nor (ii) contain organic soils as
defined in “Annex A: glossary” of the IPCC GPG LULUCF 2003, as shown above. In the baseline
scenario and the project activity, the areas of land does not experience crop- or grassland
management as shown in Table 1 and 2. Shifting cultivation in the area does not include high
inputs in the form of manure or fertilizer. Fallow vegetation is burned on site and the area is
cultivated with upland rice for mostly one to two years under presumably reduced tillage
management.
(b) The A/R CDM project activity meets the listed conditions. (i) Litter remains on site as there is no
incentive to remove litter from the plots. (ii) Also, soil disturbance associated with the A/R
activity only occurs for planting and is NOT repeated in less than 20 years.

Type and category:
Since, the capacity of the proposed project is only 8.6 MW, which is less than the maximum qualifying
capacity of 15MW, the project activity has been considered as a small scale VER project activity and
UNFCCC indicative simplified modalities and procedures are applied. The project activity utilizes the
wind potential for power generation and exports the generated electricity to the grid. According to small-
scale CDM modalities the project activity falls under:
Sectoral Scope 1 :Energy industries (renewable / non renewable sources)
Type – I :Renewable Energy Projects
Category I-D :Grid connected renewable electricity generation
Project category :1. Renewable Energy (Wind, PV, solar thermal, biomass, liquid biofuels,
geothermal, run-of- river hydro) as per VCS 01
Wind mill technology:
A wind turbine is a machine for converting the kinetic energy in wind into mechanical energy. If
the mechanical energy is used directly by machinery, such as a pump or grinding stones, the machine is
usually called a windmill. If the mechanical energy is then converted to electricity, the machine is called
a wind generator.

PROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-PDD) - Version 03
CDM – Executive Board
Rotor:
The portion of the wind turbine that collects energy from the wind is called the rotor.
Generator:
The generator is what converts the turning motion of a wind turbine's blades into electricity. Inside this
component, coils of wire are rotated in a magnetic field to produce electricity. The generator's rating, or
size, is dependent on the length of the wind turbine's blades because more energy is captured by longer
blades.
Towers: The tower on which a wind turbine is mounted is not just a support structure. It also raises the
wind turbine so that its blades safely clear the ground and so it can reach the stronger winds at higher
elevations.
The project activity involves the erection, commissioning and operation of 9 numbers of various capacity
Wind Electric Generators (WEGs) of various makes, all connected to the local evacuation facilities at the
respective sites to deliver the generated power. The technology has been provided by renowned wind
turbine manufactures Enercon India Ltd. and Suzlon Energy Ltd..All these companies are well known for
environmentally sound and safe technology. All equipment utilized in the Project is proven technology
that has been successfully applied in similar projects in other regions of the world.

Planting takes place during the rainy seasons each year.
Land preparation
Cleaning: Cleanings are being executing by using machete in order to conserve all existing
trees and shrubs. The use of glyphosate will be avoided.
Delineation: due to the topography of the area, the delineation is done by using the ""three
bobbin"" technique in order to protect the soil from erosion
Plating and whole making: The hole is made with a hoe, with a minimum diameter of 80 cm.
Internal Transport: The seedlings are transported in crates and mules from the closest road to
the Reserve to avoid damages
Fertilizing: It is done manually at the time of planting, using 50 gr of organic fertilizer per tree (In
the Annex 3 PDD can be found the Summary of the fertilization)
Application of moisture retainer: For each tree, 2 grams of the moisture retainer SAP-POLYMER
are applied. Application of moisture retainer: For each tree, 2 grams of the moisture retainer
SAP-POLYMER are applied.
Prevention and Phytosanitary Control: pest control is permanently conducted during planting
and maintenance, especially against termites and ants with appropriate products (fungicides
and insecticides of organic and biological origin).
Transport of plant materials and supplies
For the transportation of plants, the project uses a truck in which a second level is installed to
avoid damage to plants. Seedlings are carried into crates for extra protection.
The discharge is done in the vereda Puente Pelaez, because the poor conditions of the roads
prevent the access of the truck in other areas. Discharges are being executed by experienced
staff able to undertake the proper actions to avoid harming the trees.
Due to the conditions of the access roads leading to the Reserve, seedlings were transported at
the end of the track by using horses and mules, without suffering damage.
Management of the sowings
Pruning: No pruning activities will take place given that the sowings are for the restoration of
natural forest
Maintenance: maintenance to the reforestation will be done after the sowings and it will continue
during three consecutive years. Maintenance consist of:
- Cleaning
- Plateado
- Sowings
- Fertilization
After the three years of maintenance, monitoring and enrichment activities will take place inside
the reforested area.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
“Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system” Version 4.0.0. This methodological
tool is used for baseline calculations. It determines the CO emission factor for the displacement 2
of electricity generated by power plants in an electricity system, by calculating the Combined
Margin emission factor (CM) of the electricity system. The CM is the result of a weighted average
of two emission factors pertaining to the electricity system: the Operating Margin (OM) and the
Build Margin (BM).
The CO2 emission due to diesel generators of Koroglu HEPP neglected according to
methodology of ACM0002. ACM0002 says CO2 emissions due to diesel emergency generator
can be neglected.
For the demonstration of additionality, “Tool for the demonstration and assessment of
additionality”, version 7.0.0 is used.","{'project_methodologies': ['AMS-I.D.']}","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","1","1","1","1","3","0","123","Completed"

2.2 Applicability of Methodology
The proposed activity is utilization of biomass for steam generation required for various
processes at the processing unit. This is a small-scale project activity as the thermal output is
(7.85 MWthermal) which is less than 45 MWthermal. Furthermore, the project has employed a
1MW gas engine to utilise the biogas captured in wastewater treatment facility to generate power
for captive consumption. Hence, the project is a type I project. The proposed project is biomass
based thermal energy generation in 12 TPH boiler, which are renewable energy based and
therefore, selection of project category Type-I is also justified.

Further Information
Between the years 1998 and 2005, it was established a reforestation initiative in the zone, with not very
successful outcomes (Plan Ladera), due to lack of accompaniment in the process. The Plan Ladera
project is a referent for forest projects for the rural communities of the municipality of Medellin, on which
were established P. patula plantations and Eucalyptus. In general, the perception of this project has not
been favorable, especially in the townships of San Sebastian and San Cristobal because of the poor
maintenance, technical support and contracts non-compliance. In Altavista, however, this project has a
wide acceptation and has contributed to minimize the pressure on the access to lands for illegal housing,
the plantations have been like a barrier for the urban expansion, leading to conservation of micro-
watersheds and improving the landscape component.

"What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?","{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}","1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:
It was not difficult to identify the baseline scenario for this project: rapid deforestation due to
unplanned slash and burn agricultural expansion by subsistence farmers. All the conditions for the
project baseline were in place before the arrival of the project developer, Wildlife Works, and in fact
even the project area itself was beginning to be cleared before project implementation. There is little
need for speculation as to what would occur in the absence of the project if it ceased protection and
the provision of alternative livelihoods for the community. The mosaic pattern of deforestation would
continue where it left off, but most likely accelerated by a much larger population base than was
present upon our arrival.
The project area had previously been used for grazing of cattle and in some cases ecotourism. Both
activities have systematically failed, as cattle ranching is very difficult due to a fragile ecosystem and
lack of water. Most of the cattle grazing on the Phase II lands, prior to project implementation, was
being conducted out of desperation, as it was literally the only service the ecosystem could provide.
Aforestation of plantation species and agricultural activities cannot profitably be carried out in this
ecosystem, due to a lack of water and a fragile ecosystem. The forest in the project area has never
been, and never will be commercially viable. We therefore believe that through the land owners’
attempts at different economic activities that there are no credible alternative economic uses for this
land that could compete with the project financially, or provide financial sustainability that would
protect it from slash and burn use by the community. All 13 ranch directors corroborate this believe,
and in fact will provide a clear explanation of their trials and tribulations in the project area to the
validators upon the site visit in Kenya.","{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","1","1","1","1","5","1","175","-"

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
Social wellbeing: The project would help in generating employment opportunities during the
construction and operation phases. The project activity will lead to development in infrastructure
in the region like development of roads and also may promote business with improved power
generation. The project proponent will contribute 2% of net revenue realised from sale of CERs
towards community development initiatives.
Economic wellbeing: The project is a clean technology investment in the region, which would
not have been taken place in the absence of the CDM benefits the project activity will also help to
reduce the demand supply gap in the state.
The project activity will generate power using zero emissions wind based power generation which
helps to reduce GHG emissions and specific pollutants like SOx, NOx, and SPM associated with
the conventional thermal power generation facilities.
Technological wellbeing: The successful operation of project activity would lead to promotion of
wind based power generation and would encourage other entrepreneurs to participate in similar
projects.

The PLUM Peat and Mangrove Conservation and Restoration Project (PLUM Project) is a conservation
and restoration project of peat and mangrove forests located in Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia.
The project is implemented on a 23,665-hectare forest concession with Forest Utilization Business License,
held by PT Pagatan Usaha Makmur (PT PUM) for 60 years. The project will implement activities to conserve
and restore the peat and mangrove forests in the project area while delivering positive impact on the
community and biodiversity. Among others, the project will implement forest patrols, fire prevention, and
biodiversity monitoring activities to prevent forest loss and protect biodiversity. Peat ecosystems will be
restored by blocking canals and rewetting the area to avoid further peat drainage. Approximately 15,088
ha of degraded land will be restored through reforestation and Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR).
The eastern part of the project is a peatland forest area located in Katingan Regency, Katingan Kuala Sub-
district, adjacent to the Sebangau National Park. The western part of the concession is located in East
Kotawaringin Regency, Pulau Hanaut Sub-district, and mostly consists of mangrove forests (Map 2-1).
Based on the conducted biodiversity assessment, the concession provides important habitat for 31
threatened species, including the Bornean orangutan, the Proboscis monkey, and the Bornean white-
bearded gibbon. The area is also important for at least 17 migratory bird species from three families.
The project will provide tangible benefits to local communities living in the surrounding area by working to
improve local livelihoods, health, education, and well-being. For example, the project will assist local coffee
farmers and honey producers to improve harvesting, processing, and market access. The project will
support the establishment of women’s groups in the target villages to promote economic opportunities for
women; and implement interventions that improve health and sanitation in the 13 target villages.
Prior to PT PUM receiving its principal PBPH license in 2022, the project area was planned to be developed
as an oil palm plantation along with two other companies adjacent to the area. All three companies were
owned by a company group named PT Agro Inti Semesta (PT AIS). Additionally, in 2022, an approval to
convert forest land into oil palm plantation was given to another oil palm company located along the western
boundary of PT PUM. Without the PLUM Project, it is highly likely that PT PUM’s area would have been
developed into an oil palm plantation by PT AIS.
The project will generate GHG emission reductions or removals by implementing activities covered by the
VM0007 REDD+ Methodology Framework including (1) Avoiding Planned Deforestation (APD), (2)
Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR), (3) Restoration of Wetlands Ecosystems (RWE) on
Peatland and Tidal Wetlands, and (4) Avoiding Planned Wetland Degradation (APWD) on Peatland and
Tidal Wetlands. It is estimated that the project will generate a total net Verified Carbon Unit (VCU) volume
of 69,999,940 tCO e over 60 years of crediting period or 1,166,666 tCO e per annum (Table 3-44). 2 2
The project’s goal is to conserve the remaining forest, restore ecosystem function, protect biodiversity, and
improve the well-being of communities to become resilient to climate change. In conclusion, it is expected
that the PLUM Project will contribute to preserving the integrity of the Peat Swamp and Mangrove Forest
landscape and biodiversity in the area while improving the well-being of local communities.

The project activity is comprised of a capacity upgrade of Gunung Salak Geothermal Power Plant
from 3 x 55 MW to 3 x 60 MW. The additional installed capacity of 15 MW at Gunung Salak
Geothermal power plant generates and supplies an average of 213,959 MWh p.a. of electricity to
the connected JAMALI Grid. The project is owned and developed by PT. Indonesia Power, a
subsidiary company of PT. PLN (Persero), a state-­owned electricity company. The proposed
project will increase the utilization of renewable energy sources, in this case geothermal energy,
by modifying turbines and steam gas ejectors. Steam for the project is provided by Chevron
Geothermal Indonesia under an Energy Sales Contract (ESC) between PT. PLN (Persero)
Pertamina, a state-­owned oil and gas company, and Unocal Geothermal of Indonesia (Unocal
Geothermal Indonesia was acquired by Chevron Geothermal Indonesia Ltd. Though today,
Gunung Salak geothermal fields are owned by Star Energy Geothermal Salak Ltd.).
According to the CDM UNFCCC criteria, one approved GHG program by the VCS Board, the
project is classified as large scale and, based on Annex A of the Kyoto Protocol, falls under Sectoral
Category 1, Energy Industries (renewable/non renewable).
According to the Voluntary Carbon Standard, the project activity falls under the category of

of the project activity:
>>
The EIA report of the Project was completed by Heilongjiang Farming Investigation & Design Institute,
and approved by the Environment Protection Bureau of Kunming (Document No.: Kun Huan Bao Fu
[2005]132). Based on the EIA report, the environmental impacts possibly caused by the Project and
corresponding measures adopted by the project owner are analyzed as follows:
Land use
Adopting a combined usage of channels and tunnels, the Project does not involve migration of local
residents and great amount of land occupation. The project will permanently take up 29 Mu of land and
temporarily 79 Mu of land, both of which are composed primarily of paddy field and dry land. The
project owner will make compensations according to the Land Administration Law of the People’s
Republic of China, the Land Administration Regulation of Yunnan Province and relevant regulations to
the residents affected. By opening up wasteland in the village and the community, same area of land
occupied will be developed and made up.
Air pollution and noise
Noise from various construction machines and exhaust gas emitted from vehicles as well as dust during
the construction of the Project will have temporary impacts on part of the air environment and acoustical
environment of the construction area. The project owner will take measures to reduce the above impacts
on the workers, including installing dust prevention system for dust-generating facilities, sprinkling water
at irregular intervals, reinforcing maintenance of machinery and providing reasonable protection
measures. All of these impacts are temporary and are reduced with above measures.
Waste water
Major pollutants of production waste water during construction and operation of the Project are
suspending particles, which are innoxious. It will be discharged after removing the suspending particles
by means of sedimentation tank. Residential waste water, after lagoon treatment, will be used as fertilizer
and not discharged directly into the river.
Solid waste
Waste solid and residential garbage will be generated during the construction and operation of the
Project. The former will be dumped in the 6 designated spoil areas, while the latter will be dumped in
fixed garbage stations and regularly cleared by specific people.
Ecological impact
Status quo will be maintained of the river course and basically no inundation will occur after the
completion of the Project, therefore, there will be no impacts on the ecological environment.
In summary, negative impacts on the environment caused by the Project mainly occur in the construction
period which will be eliminated with the completion of the Project. Accompanied by the implementation

Since the capacity of the wind farm project is 9 MW, which is less than the maximum qualifying capacity
of 15 MW, the project falls under the UNFCCC small-scale CDM project activity categories under Type-I
with project activity being renewable electricity generation for a grid.
Sectoral Scope: 1 – Energy Industries (renewable-/non-renewable sources)
Type: I -Renewable Energy Projects
Category: I.D “Grid connected renewable electricity generation”
As per paragraph 1 under Category I.D of Appendix B of the UNFCCC-defined simplified modalities
and procedures (M&P) for small-scale CDM project activities (Version 10: 23rd December 2006)
Type I.D “comprises renewables, such as photovoltaics, hydro, tidal/wave, wind, geothermal, and
biomass, that supply electricity to an electricity distribution system that is or would have been supplied by
at least one fossil fuel or non-renewable biomass fired generating unit”. The project is a grid-connected
wind based power plant and qualifies as a Category I. D project activity.
The technology consists of conversion of the energy available in the wind flow to mechanical energy
using a wind turbine. By connecting the turbine to a generator, the mechanical energy is converted into
electricity energy. Therefore, in this process, there are no greenhouse gas emissions or burning of any
fossil fuels. Thus electricity is generated through sustainable means without causing any negative effect
on the environment and hence the technology is environmentally safe and sound.
The project employs the use of wind energy for the purpose of electricity generation. Since, the
technology employed by the project proponent does not result in GHG emissions; the project does not
cause any negative effects on the environment. Hence, the technology used for the project activities do
not pose any threat to the environment when compared to the fossil fuel-fired power plants.

WeAct Pty Ltd (WeAct) seeks to combine elements of conventional integrated conservation and
development projects (ICDP) with a “payments for ecosystem services” (PES) approach when
designing and implementing the REDD project. REDD has at times been conceived narrowly as
simply a system of conditional performance-based payments (PES), (Sills et al. (2009), The
evolving landscape of REDD projects). Projects developed by WeAct are similarly premised on
performance-based payments, but we have gone further in developing an approach to project
implementation that recognizes the part that can be played by tried and tested interventions. These
include participatory land use mapping, boundary determination, development of land use plans,
clarification of tenure, income generating activities, employment and community development.
The project is estimated to generate approximately 1.98 million VCUs over 30 years. The project
area is located in the municipality of Acandí on the northwestern coast of the Gulf of Urabá in the
Colombian department of Choco. Belonging to the biologically diverse Chocó-Darién bioregion,
forests in the project area are important nationally and internationally for the ecosystem and
biodiversity services they provide. Forests in the project area, however, have experienced a
continued reduction in biomass due largely to illegal logging and to the establishment of crops, use
of firewood, pastures, and settlements. These forests have historically been an important source
of income for local families, who periodically harvest timber when the economic needs arise, or to
generate income generation sources.
Changes to Colombian Constitutional Law in 1991 resulted in the recognition of the ancestral
presence and possession of lands by communities of African descent holding ethnic traditions and
cultural identity. Subsequent legislation, through Law 70 of 1991, as detailed in Section 1.3.5,
granted land title and administrative autonomy to these communities. Law 70 also gave these
communities the rights of ownership of forests, and the rights of use of other natural resources
present in their territories, though subject to the general legal dispositions of Colombia.
Agriculture, cattle ranching, and clearing for tourist infrastructure and related services are the main
deforestation drivers, additional to fuelwood and illegal timber extraction. Continual timber
extraction eases the transition of forests to agriculture and pasture land use. The project aims to
alleviate these pressures on the forests through the support of governance capacity (including
individual property titling, land-use planning and conservation zone demarcation), the generation
of alternative economic activities and income sources, and through capacity building in
administration and management. These project activities, beyond protecting local forests and
biodiversity, contribute to social and economic development in one of the poorest areas of
Colombia. The effectiveness of these activities is partially dependent on their long-term economic
success and wide-spread adoption.
Since the project’s inception, local communities have been actively participating in the project’s
formulation and implementation. The early involvement of participating communities has created

awareness among community members and readiness for project implementation. Community
support has culminated in the project’s endorsement by the legal representatives of communities
and the communities’ General Assembly. These endorsements demonstrate the communities’
long-term commitment to emissions reductions from avoided logging and deforestation.
Location of the project:
The project is located in the municipality of Acandí on the northwestern coast of the Gulf of Urabá
in the Colombian department of Choco. This project area covers 10,433 hectares of forests and is
located 162 km from Monteria, the capital of Department of Córdoba, Colombia.
The project objectives are threefold: (i) to mitigate climate change by reducing deforestation and
recuperation of already degraded forest lands; (ii) contribute to biodiversity conservation including
High Conservation Values, and, (iii) foster sustainable development of local communities. Following
is a more detailed description of each objective.
i) Climate Objectives
The project’s climate objectives are to mitigate climate change through measures to alleviate the
drivers of deforestation. The resultant decrease in illegal logging, the recovery of already degraded
forests, and the reduction of forest conversion to other land uses is expected to decrease emissions
and enhance forest carbon stocks over time.
ii) Community Objectives
The project’s community objectives are to strengthen livelihood capitals as defined by some of the
Basic Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF) (Richards 2011). These are: (i) strengthening local
governance through improvements to land-use planning and implementation; (ii) supporting the
development of sustainable economic and livelihoods alternatives through training and technical
assistance in agriculture and fisheries, harvesting equipment, and value chains for poor vulnerable
communities; (iii) enhancing local administrative, leadership capacity and environmental
awareness through training activities which intentionally include women from the communities; and
(iv) enhancing social capital through the creation or strengthening of institutions (corporations,
associations, cooperatives).
iii) Biodiversity Objectives
To contribute to biodiversity conservation through long-term improvements and connectivity of
dense natural forest cover and associated structural, compositional, functional and High
Conservation Value attributes, as compared to baseline scenario conditions","{'project_state_province': 'Choco', 'project_country': 'Colombia'}","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","1","1","1","3","3","1","215","-"

The ITAÚBA REDD+ PROJECT aims at protecting forests in one of the regions having the highest
deforestation trends in the Amazon Biome: the municipalities of Itaúba and Marcelândia. Both the
municipalities are inside the “Arc of Deforestation” and since the colonization of the municipalities, besides
the damage caused to natural ecosystems, several social conflicts have emerged from the dynamics of
unsustainable land use, associated with the extensive deforestation and degradation activities. Throughout
time, communities with livelihoods based on family-scale agriculture and forest resources were expulsed
from the region and gave place to the large scale agricultural and pasture activities.
For the project period, the baseline scenario for the Project Area indicates that the historical patterns of
change in land-use would be reproduced: extensive deforestation and systematic conversion from forest to
soy crops and pasture areas for cattle ranching, far above the limits stablished by the Brazilian Forest Code.
The project activities are designed to avoid the deforestation drivers that would realize the referred baseline
in the without project scenario, with the long-term vision of restoring the relation of local communities of
rural workers with the forest areas and contribute with the transition to socioeconomic scenario build on
bioeconomy principles. With project activity approval, the proponents intend to improve the mechanisms of
remote and in loco surveillance, as well as implement activities that will result in other climate, community,
and biodiversity benefits.

Purpose of project activity: The project proponent, SSL installed a 15MW grid-
connected renewable electricity generation project in the state of Maharashtra. As the
grid is dominated by the fossil fuel fired power plants, the displacement of electricity
produced from fossil fuel dominated power plants with the electricity supplied by the
project activity causes a reduction in the GHG emissions. The generated electricity from
WTGs is supplied to Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited
(MSEDCL)2 which comes under NEWNE grid3.
The project activity will lead to following benefits:
• The project activity contributes to climate change mitigation efforts through
generation of electrical energy from renewable wind power resources.
• Selling the generated electricity to state electricity utilities which has majority of
fossil fuel dominated power plants.
Contribution of project activity to sustainable development in line with indicators
for sustainable development in the interim approval guideline4 by Government of
India:
• Generation of power from renewable resource of wind to displace grid;
• Conservation of fossil fuel reserves;
• Reducing GHG emissions compared to grid based electric generation (business-
as-usual scenario);
• Providing means of employment to the nearby villagers

E.1. Brief description how comments by local stakeholdershave been invited and compiled:
>>
The stakeholder consultation for the Project activity took place in September, 200920. On 01/09/2009, a
notice was put on the bulletin board of government building of Toksun County by the project developer.
The notice showed an introduction of the project activity and an invitation to the local stakeholders to fill
in the questionnaires for their comments. All the questionnairs are completed on 17 September 2009.
Since no residents live close to the proposed project, almost no residents are expected to be easily
affected by the on-site construction and operation. Therefore, it’s reasonable to deliver the questionnaires
to the residents within Toksun County.
The questionnaire was designed to be easily filled in with the following sections:
1) Project introduction
2) Questions on:
♦ What impacts do you think the CDM Project activity will have on the environment in the local area?
♦ What impacts do you think the CDM Project activity will have on the employment in the local area?
♦ What impacts do you think the CDM Project activity will have on your livelihood?
♦ What impacts do you think the CDM Project activity will have on the economic development in the
local area?
♦ What would be the overall effects of the construction and operation of the CDM Project activity?
♦ Do they support the construction of the CDM Project?

1.9 Project Location
The project is constituted by the CAZ protected area and the adjacent community-managed
forests, located in the center of Madagascar´s eastern slope rainforests in the Province of
Toamasina (Figure 1). It is broadly delimited by the Zahamena National Park (center:
17°40´S, 48°50´E) to the north and the Ankeniheny Classified Forest in the commune of
Lakato to the south. The precise boundaries of the project area are defined by the limits of
the protected area, and the limits of the community management forest areas. GIS and KML
files of the project boundaries are available to the validator. The separate parcels’ ID,
coordinates of centroids, area and land tenure status are presented in Annex 3.
The project area covers 370,032 hectares and is entirely owned by the Government of
Madagascar. It is found within the regions of Alaotra-Mangoro and Atsinanana; and the
districts of Ambatondrazaka, Moramanga, Brickaville, Toamasina II and Vatomandry. The

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
Version 17, 17/06/2011 as described in Appendix B of the simplified modalities and procedures
for small-scale CDM project activities.
In accordance with the provisions of AMS-I.D, the following tools were used.
“Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system” (Version 04/EB 75 Annex 15)
As the project emission is zero, emission reductions are equivalent to the emissions avoided in
the baseline scenario. The baseline is calculated on the net electricity exported to the grid and the
grid emission factor. The avoided emissions can be measured directly by the quantum of
electricity exported and imported is monitored by electricity meters at the generation site and at
the point of connection to the grid.
The project activity meets the eligibility criteria to use simplified modalities and procedure for
small scale CDM project activities as set out in paragraph 6 (c) of decision 17/CP.7 in the

holder meeting was conducted on March 8, 2007 at Gudepachgani. It was attended by local people, who
were directly or indirectly impacted by the project activity.
The project activity is carried out at an arid location which is economically less attractive to locals. No
agricultural activity or any other activity such as tourism or mineral excavation carried out at the project
site. The project activity has not resulted in any sort of migration of local people. Project promoter
strongly feels that, this project activity will prove out to be very conducive to the sustainable development
of this region. In order to assess the impact of the wind power project activity on its locality, the project
promoter undertook stake holder consultation at the project site. The purpose was to assess the impact &
address the negative impact if any?
These stake holders were identified based on the environmental, socio-economic and health impact of
project activity on people living in & around the project activity. Stake holders were mostly farmers. The
stake holders were invited from the neighbouring locations, as the project activity area is far away from
the residential area. Project Promoter sent invitation letters to all the respective stakeholders, requesting
them to attend the stakeholder meeting and share their views on the project activity.

The choice of methodology ACM0002, is justified as the project activity meets its applicability criteria:
 The proposed project activity is a greenfield, grid connected renewable electricity
generation project,
 The project does not involve combined heat and power generation activity
 The geographic and system boundaries for the relevant electricity grid can be clearly
identified and information on the characteristics of the grid is available.

 Project is a run-off-river type HEPP and does not have storage capacity. Power density of
the reservoir is greater than 4 W/m2.
Since there exists no delineation of project electricity system or connected electricity systems by DNA,
following criteria has been used to determine the existence of significant transmission constraints:
 In case of electricity systems with spot markets for electricity: there are differences in electricity
prices (without transmission and distribution costs) of more than 5 percent between the systems
during 60 percent or more of the hours of the year.
 The transmission line is operated at 90% or more of its rated capacity during 90% percent or
more of the hours of the year.
Since the project output is fed to the Turkish electricity grid which does not involve any distinct electricity
systems that applies different price, first criteria defined above is not applicable. Also, since the
transmission line between the proposed projects and nearest substation is built within the scope of the
project and there exist no information on grid capacity utilization, second criteria is also inapplicable.
Based on assessment above, it is difficult to conclude with a significant transmission constraint or grid
boundary. Since there is no dispatch grid system in Turkey, the project boundary is considered as the
National Electricity Grid of Turkey according to applied tool. The geographical and physical boundaries of
the Turkish grid and location of the power plants are well identified as given diagram below.

The project will be a Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) project within the sectoral scope of Agriculture,
Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) and category Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR)
and Wetlands Restoration and Conservation (WRC). In terms of the WRC activity type, the project activity
aims to enhance mangrove ecosystems, and hence the WRC activity type represents RWE (Restoring
Wetland Ecosystems).
Project is NOT a grouped project.
As per Section 2.1 of VCS Standard (Version 4.2), the project is subject to the six Kyoto Protocol
greenhouse gases, aiming to reduce the carbon and other greenhouses gases (GHG) emissions by
restoring the degraded mangrove forests. Hence, it falls under the ARR category. The methodology of the
project also refers to the latest version of the following tools approved by the Clean Development
Mechanism (Version 03.0): Afforestation and reforestation of degraded mangrove habitats (AR AM0014).
In addition, as per Section 3.2.8 of VCS Standard (Version 4.2), all ARR projects occurring on wetlands
shall adhere to both the respective project category requirements and the WRC (Wetlands Restoration
and Conservation) requirements, unless the expected emissions from the soil organic carbon pool or
change in the soil organic carbon pool in the project scenario is deemed below de minimis or can be
conservatively excluded as set out in the VCS program document VCS Methodology Requirements, in
which case the project shall not be subject to the WRC requirements. For this project soil organic carbon

is an important part of the total amount of the carbon sequestrated, hence the project will comply with
both ARR requirements and WRC requirements. Upon the requirements, the periodic reassessment of
the baseline, at least not more than 10 years, will be undertaken to capture changes in the drivers and/or
behavior of agents that cause the change in land use, hydrology, sediment supply and/or land or water
management practices and changes in carbon stocks. At the time of baseline assessment, the project
description will be updated by following the requirements of the latest approved version methodology.","{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","1","1","1","1","5","1","315","-"

activity:
The baseline and monitoring methodology ACM0002 is applicable to the proposed project, because the
project meets all the applicability criteria stated in the methodology and associated tools:
• The proposed project involves the installation of a new grid-connected renewable power plant at
a site where no renewable power plant was operated prior to the implementation of the project
activity (Greenfield plant).
• The project activity is the installation of a hydro power plant.
• The project activity has a new reservoir with power density of 24.5W/m2 which is greater than
4W/m2. (See Section B.6.1. for detailed calculations)
• The project does not involve an on-site switch from fossil fuels to a renewable source.
• The methodology will be used in conjunction with the tools referred to above.
The latest version of ACM0002 (version 12.1.0) has been applied.","{'project_methodologies': ['ACM0002']}","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN","5","NaN","NaN","1","361","-"

of southern Africa to form a relatively narrow coastal plain along the Indian Ocean.
the topography is characterized by east-west-trending mountain ranges and valleys. East of the
Great Fish River, including the lower valley of the Great Kei River, perennial streams have carved
deep valleys on their way to the ocean. The province’s natural vegetation is largely grassveld, with
some forest on the coast west of Humansdorp. The climate along the coast is subtropical; it is
mild at higher elevations to the north. Summers are hot, and snow falls in winter on the high
northern mountains. The average temperature varies from 14.90C to 23.70C.11 The average
annual precipitation increases from 541 mm near Port Elizabeth to more than 775 mm12 along
the coast near East London in the east.
The project area covers an area of approximately 70,737.5 hectares.
Project Area: Kwazulu Natal (Kokstad, Umgeni, Impendle, NottinghamRd)
KwaZulu-Natal is generally hilly or mountainous, especially along its western border. The land
rises from the coast to more than 11,000 feet (3,300 metres)13 along
the Drakensberg Escarpment on that border. The slope is not gradual, however, and various rocky
outcrops render the terrain into steps of undulating land ascending from an elevation of 500 feet
(150 metres) along the coastal plain to areas of 2,000 feet (600 metres) and then 4,000 feet
(1,200 metres) in the centre of the province, a region known as the Midlands. Beyond the
Drakensberg lies the Highveld, or high plateau. KwaZulu-Natal’s climate varies from subtropical
to temperate. Average temperature ranges from 23.2 0C to 25,6 0C14. Precipitation decreases
from 918 mm annually along the coast to 680 mm15 inland. Temperatures decrease from the

According to Appendix of 1 Eligible AFOLU Project Categories of the VCS Standard (version 4.4), eligible
Agricultural Land Management (ALM) activities are those that reduce net GHG emissions on croplands and
grasslands by increasing carbon stocks in soils and woody biomass and/or decreasing CO2, N2O and/or
CH4 emissions from soils, which include Improved Cropland Management (ICM), Improved Grassland
Management (IGM) and Cropland and Grassland Land-use Conversions (CGLC).
The project restores degraded grassland by planting grass and sustainable management of grazing
activities, thus increasing soil carbon stocks. So, the project is developed under VCS scope 14 “Agriculture,
Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)” with a project category of Agricultural Land Management (ALM),
and belongs to the category of Improved Grassland Management (IGM) that demonstrably reduce net GHG
emissions of grassland ecosystems by increasing soil carbon stocks.
