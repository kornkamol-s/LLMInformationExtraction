Without the project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded\nmethod, the traditional continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice\nwas cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter\nin rice soil under flooded conditions can emit a large amount of methane because of anaerobic\ndecomposition, the intermittently flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production\nincrease, and less methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\nThe implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir construction,\npumps and valves installation, training, etc. According to the needs of rice growth, farmers use pumps\nand valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water resources but also reduces\nmethane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions. Through the pumps and\nvalves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice paddies in time in the dry season, and the\nexcess water can be drained from the rice paddies in the rainy season. In this case, the methane\nemission can be declined by an average of 48%.

(HTSSL) is established in 1989, is a pioneer in repair,\ncalibration, testing, project management and maintenance services for electrical test and\nmeasuring equipment. HTSSL is also engaged in manufacturing of high-pressure level gauges,\nwater columns, instruments and pressure parts for boiler applications. The HTSSL with a view to\nalign itself with sustainable development policies of India has undertaken this project to produce\ngreen power using wind as an energy source. The project is located in the existing wasteland\navailable in district Aanathpur, Andhra Pradesh state of India.\nDescription of Project Activity:\nThe project activity has been undertaken to harness the available wind power potential in the\nState of Andhra Pradesh. The project activity will install and operate 2 number Suzlon make 2100\nkW sophisticated, state-of art Wind Turbine Generators (WTG) aggregating to a total installed\ncapacity of 4.2 MW. The project will generate approximately 8462MWh of electricity per annum,\nwhich will be sold to Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Boards. The project activity will help in\ngreen house gas (GHG) emission reduction by using renewable resources (wind energy) for\ngenerating power which otherwise would have been generated using grid mix power plants,\nwhich is dominated by fossil fuel based thermal power plants. The project activity is a green field\nproject aimed at utilising wind to produce power. The technological details have been provided in\nSection 1.8.\nThe project activity doesn\u2019t involve any GHG emission sources. The estimated annual average\nand the total CO e emission reduction by the project activity over the first renewable crediting 2\nperiod of 7 years are expected to be 8152tCO2e and 57064tCO e respectively. 2\nThe spatial extent of project boundary is the Southern grid. The project activity will supply\nelectricity to Southern grid through transmission lines connected through sub-stations.\nSince the project activity will generate electricity through wind energy, a clean renewable energy\nsource it will not cause any negative impact on the environment and thereby contributes to\nclimate change mitigation efforts.\nPre-project Scenario\/Baseline Scenario:\nIn the pre project scenario, the equivalent amount of electricity would have been generated by\ngrid connected fossil fuel based power plants.\nThe project activity is a Greenfield project activity with no power generation facility existing at the\nproject site in the pre-project scenario.

The\nproject is aimed to restore the local degraded grassland ecosystem from adoption of sustainable\ngrassland management practices, such as improving the rotation of grazing animals, limiting the\ntiming and number of grazing animals on degraded pastures, and ensuring appropriate\nmanagement over the long-term. The project proponent is Yining County State-owned Investment\nCapital Management limited liability Company.\nThe main restoration measure rest and rotational grazing were implemented in 266,666.78 ha of\ndegraded grassland where the theoretical animal capacity is about 521.3 thousand sheep which\nwas decreased by 51.15% compared with the non-degraded grassland data in 200313. The project\narea is categorized into two groups. The first group of grassland will undergo sustainable grassland\nmanagement practices, which include implementing rotational grazing in different pastoral areas.\nThis approach involves limiting the duration and number of grazing activities in the project area to\nprotect the natural resources of the grassland and prevent further deterioration of the ecological\nenvironment. In contrast, the second group of grassland will experience a prohibition on grazing\nduring the first five years of the project. After this initial period, sustainable grassland management\nmethods will be applied. These methods involve reducing grazing time by dividing the grasslands\ninto seasonal grazing areas, determined by the carrying capacity of the grassland and the\nconstruction of fences. Specific guidelines, such as designated grazing orders, grazing cycles, and\nzoning for grazing time, will be followed to ensure that the grassland is grazed systematically, area\nby area, in a rotational manner.\nIn addition to the main restoration measures, the project incorporates various grassland\nmanagement measures aimed at mitigating soil desertification, restoring grassland vegetation,\nenhancing soil carbon storage, and promoting local biodiversity. These additional measures include\ninitiatives such as rodent and pest control, as well as grassland fire prevention. By implementing\nthese additional measures, the project aims to ensure the long-term sustainable management of\nthe project area, mitigate soil desertification, restore grassland vegetation, and ultimately contribute\nto the improvement of soil carbon storage and the preservation of local biodiversity.\nAccording to the baseline survey, before the implementation of the project, the grassland in the\nproject area was facing serious degradation and even desertification due to the impact of climate\nchange and human activities. The project is estimated to generate GHG emission removals of\n5,097,316 tCO e in 20 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 254,866 tCO e. 2 2\nThe objectives of the project including:\n\u26ab Climate: Restore the degraded grassland ecosystem, increase grassland coverage, increase\ngrassland carbon sink function, and reduce GHG emissions.\n13 County annals\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 8\n\n[['', 'Project Scale', None, ''], ['Project', None, '', None], ['Large project', None, 'X', None]]\n[['', 'Organization name', '', 'Yining Xingxiang Investment Development Co., Ltd'], ['', 'Contact person', '', 'Liu Lili'], ['', 'Title', '', 'Manager'], ['Address', 'Address', None, \"Office No. 26, Building 88, District 7, Yining County, Yining County,\\nXinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, People's Republic of China\"], ['', 'Telephone', '', '+86-18699486809'], ['', 'Email', '', '5691510353@qq.com']]\n[['', 'Organization name', '', 'Fujian Jinsen Carbon Sink Technology Co., Ltd'], ['', 'Contact person', '', 'Wang bin'], ['', 'Title', '', 'Manager'], ['Address', 'Address', None, '12-15 floors, Jinsen Building, No. 50 Sanhua South Road, Shuinan\\nTown, Jiangle County, Sanming City, Fujian Province, China'], ['', 'Telephone', '', '+86 13067277897'], ['', 'Email', '', 'wb@fjjscs.com']]\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\n\u26ab Community: Improve the livelihood of local herders, provide permanent and temporary job\nopportunities for them, increase their income.

However, project owner\u2019s personnel\nhave visited several local communities and discussed the projects with stakeholders. Site visits\nand local meetings suggest that the local people are supportive and do believe that the Project is a\npositive contribution to their region. No significant potential adverse economic, environmental or\nsocial impact was brought up by any stakeholder and comments were rather positive. According to\nthese site visits, the Project activity does not have significant impact on communities as the\nmajority of the Project footprint is on forest land rather than on agricultural or residential use. Since\nthere is minimum private land in Project\u2019s boundaries, land purchases are also limited and there is\nno involuntary relocation of households. Local people do mainly focus on potential job\nopportunities for their communities.\nThere is no DNA in Turkey. The National Focal Point of Turkey is the Ministry of Environment and\nForestry. The Turkish National Focal Point has been involved in the consultation process.\nMeetings with affected villages indicated that villagers are informed about the projects and\npotential impacts. Most frequently repeated questions and demands involved fair and timely land\nand housing compensation, employment opportunities for youth, and health. Since an EIA report\nwas not required by the Ministry of Environment and Forest, no official EIA meeting was organized.\nInstead, various unofficial meetings have been carried out between the project owner and local\ncommunities.

For baseline calculations,\nACM0002 refers to the \u201cTool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system\u201d, Version 7.0.\nAdditionality is demonstrated via application of the \u201cTool for the demonstration and assessment of\nadditionality\u201d, Version 07.0. The methodology is used in conjunction with the following tools:\n1. Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system (Version 07.0.0)17\n2. Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality (Version 07.0.0)18\n3. Tool to determine the remaining lifetime of the equipment (Version 01.0.0)19\n4. Assessment of the validity of the original\/current baseline and update of the baseline at the\nrenewal of the crediting period (Version 03.0.1)20\n3.2 Applicability of Methodology\nThe choice of methodology ACM0002 Version 20 is justified as the proposed project activity meets the\nrelevant applicability criteria:\nThe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project involves installation 20.21 MWe grid connected renewable\nelectricity generation plant,\nThe methodology is applicable under the following conditions:\n\u2022 The project activity results in new reservoirs and the power density of the power plant, as per\ndefinitions given in the project emissions section, is greater than 4 W\/m2. In addition, as in the\ncase of Cakit HPP this density is above the 10 W\/m2 threshold (456.51 W\/m2; reservoir size:\n44,271 m2, installed capacity: 20,210,000 W). Hence, the project emission (PE, HP,y) is zero in line\nwith the section [5.4.3 \u2013 38 \u2013 c) \u2013 Equation (10)] of the ACM0002 methodology.\n\u2022 The project activity is the installation of a hydro power plant with a run-of-river reservoir.\n\u2022 The project activity is not capacity additions, retrofits or replacements.\n16 Please see\nhttps:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/filestorage\/A\/G\/0\/AG07ZJQ3EXD42LT5YV9HR16M8KINPO\/EB105_repan03_ACM0002.pdf?t=c\nDd8cXpzODQxfDDnVJ4epRID57OLFx5k1djQ\n17 Please see https:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/methodologies\/PAmethodologies\/tools\/am-tool-07-v7.0.pdf\n18 Please see https:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/methodologies\/PAmethodologies\/tools\/am-tool-01-v7.0.0.pdf\n19 Please see http:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/methodologies\/PAmethodologies\/tools\/am-tool-10-v1.pdf\n20 Please see https:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/methodologies\/PAmethodologies\/tools\/am-tool-11-v3.0.1.pdf\n18\n\n[['', 'Source', None, None, None, '', '', 'Gas', '', '', 'Included?', '', '', 'Justification\/Explanation', ''], ['', 'e\\nn\\nile\\ns\\na\\nB', '', 'CO emissions\\n2\\nfrom electricity\\ngeneration in\\nfossil fuel fired\\npower plants that\\nare displaced due', 'CO emissions\\n2', None, 'CO\\n2', 'CO\\n2', None, 'Yes', 'Yes', None, '', 'Main emission source: Fossil fuels fired for electricity', ''], [None, None, None, None, 'from electricity', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'generation cause CO emissions.

Rigorous monitoring\nand reporting protocols are in place to ensure that the emission reductions and removals\nassociated with our project are accurately measured and verified, and these protocols will\nprovide the necessary assurance that the project is achieving tangible and measurable\noutcomes. In summary, while a public statement is not legally required in T\u00fcrkiye, necessary\nsupport and participation of the owner(s) and retailer(s) of the impacted goods and services\nhave been secured and that the project has the necessary monitoring and reporting\nmechanisms in place to ensure high-integrity outcomes.\nHas the project proponent posted a public statement saying, \u201cVCUs may be issued for the\ngreenhouse gas emission reductions and removals associated with [name of good or\nservice][describe the region or location, including organization name(s), where practicable].\u201d\n\u2610 Yes \u2612 No\nIn T\u00fcrkiye, the transparency platform of the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EP\u0130AS) does\nnot currently provide public statements regarding the VCU status of reduction and removal\nprojects. This makes it not practicable for the project proponent to post such a statement.\nHowever, the proposed project fully complies with all relevant regulations and guidelines set\nforth by the Turkish government. All necessary measures have been taken to ensure the\nintegrity and veracity of our emissions reductions and removals. The project has been\nthoroughly planned and researched to ensure maximum impact and effectiveness in reducing\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\nHave the producer(s) or retailer(s) of the impacted good or service been notified of the project\nand the potential risk of Scope 3 emissions double claiming via email?\n\u2610 Yes \u2612 No\n4 Impacted goods and services are all goods and services directly impacted by the technologies and measures specified as\nproject activities in the project description. Please see the VCS Program document VCS Program Definitions for additional\ninformation.\n16\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\nIn this project, emissions are reduced from the electricity sector in T\u00fcrkiye by implementing\nrenewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures. The produced good in this project is\nelectricity, which falls under Scope 1 and 2 emissions of industrial producers. As such, there is\nno direct involvement of any specific producer or retailer of the impacted good or service in this\nproject. The project's emissions reductions will be accurately tracked and verified by an\nindependent third party, ensuring that the emissions reductions are real, measurable, and\npermanent. Furthermore, T\u00fcrkiye has a centralized national grid system, which means that all\nelectricity generated is fed into the same grid and distributed to all consumers. In this context,\nthere is no potential risk of double counting or double claiming of emissions.\n1.17 Sustainable Development Contributions\nThe project is expected to contribute 4 SDGs which are SDG 3, 7, 8 and 13.\nSDG 3 Good Health and Well-being: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all\nages. Target 3.9 is: \"By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from\nhazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination.\"\nSDG 7 Energy: The project contributes SDG Target 7.2 \u201cBy 2030, increase substantially the\nshare of renewable energy in the global energy mix\u201d by the utilization of solar power as a\nrenewable energy source.\nSDG 8 Economic Growth: The project creates direct and indirect employment opportunities\nduring construction and operation phases, so it contributes to SDG Target 8.5 \u201cBy 2030,\nachieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for\nyoung people and persons with disabilities and equal pay for work of equal value\u201d.\nSDG 13 Climate Change: The project produces clean renewable energy by diminishing CO 2\nemissions.
