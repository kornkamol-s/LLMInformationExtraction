The methodology implemented is:\n\u2022 VM0007 REDD Methodology Framework but limited to the planned deforestation\nactivities (module VMD0006 (BL-PL) as well as other modules listed in section 2.1\nbelow)\nProtection of the project areas under this methodology will prevent the emissions from\ndeforestation and conversion to pastures and allow the forest to reclaim its status as a primary\nforest.\nThe project is a grouped project and the instances must be located in the only geographic area\ndefined by the union of the Departments of Pando or Beni in Bolivia. The instances must be\nunder threat of planned deforestation for conversion to agricultural activities as defined under\nVM0007 at the time the project proponent took ownership of the project area.\nThe project starts with only one instance but this number is expected to grow with time. The\ninstance is located in the department of Beni, 150 km south of Riberalta and forms part of the\nBolivian Amazon Forest. The project area is home to species listed in the red book as vulnerable\nand endangered such as Cedrela Odorata: Bertholletia excelsa, Amburana cearencis. The project\nare has suffered in the past to some degree or other from selective logging, deforestation for\nagricultural purposes and deforestation resulting from human induced fires.\nIn protecting the forest, the project will pay special attention to endangered and vulnerable tree\nspecies native to the region while ensuring that the communities surrounding the project areas do\nnot suffer the full impact of job losses associated with forest preservation. In addition to\nprotecting the forests in the project areas, the project will enrich the project areas with\nendangered and vulnerable tree species. The prevention of deforestation will lead to the loss of\nemployment opportunities. This will be partly mitigated by the project\u2019s area enrichment with\nendangered and vulnerable tree species that will generate employment throughout the duration of\nthe project.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nv3.0 3\n\n[['', 'Project Activity', 'Planned Deforestation for\\nconversion to agricultural use'], [None, 'Grouped', 'yes']]\n[['Name', 'Fermin Aldabe'], ['Responsibility', 'Responsibility for managing the whole project'], ['Telephone', '+591 74752400'], ['Address', 'Nicanor Salvatierra 179\\nZona Central\\nRiberalta\\nBolivia']]\n[['Start Date', '20 October 2011'], ['End date', '19 October 2041'], ['Total number of years', '30']]\n[['', 'Project', '', 'X'], ['', 'Mega-project', '', '']]\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n1.3 Project Proponent\n1.4 Other Entities Involved in the Project\n1.5 Project Start Date\nProject start date 20 October 2011\n1.6 Project Crediting Period\n1.7 Project Scale and Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals\nv3.0 4","output":"{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}"}

The main objective\nof the project is to meet the parent paper mill\u2019s total\nenergy (both thermal and electrical) requirement in an\nefficient manner utilizing renewable agro residues abundantly\navailable in the region and avoid the usage of fossil fuel to\nthe extent agro residue becomes available. The installed\npower generating capacity of the project is 8MW . electrical\nUtilization of waste biomass not only reduces GHG emission by\ndisplacing fossil fuel but also helps control indiscriminate\nopen air burning and decomposition in fields under anaerobic\ncondition. Open air burning of biomass leads to N O emission 2\nand decomposition of biomasses on the fields results in\nmethane emission and obnoxious odour problems. Both N O and 2\nCH have higher global warming potential (GWP) than CO . 4 2\nFurther, projects of this kind would marginally provide\nsolutions to the problem of space constraint for the disposal\nand decomposition of agro residues, a common agricultural\nwaste management problem, in all agriculture based nations\nincluding in India.\nThe biomass residues fired in the project boiler are mainly\nDe-oiled Rice Bran (DOB), and Saw Dust, and Wood\nChips\/Chipped Saw Dust in small amount. ITC carried out a\nsurvey of the surplus availability of the biomass residues\nlike De-oiled Rice Bran (DOB), Saw Dust, Wood chips\/Chipped\nSaw Dust in the region within a radius of 200 km from the\nproject site. The survey was conducted by the Department of\nAgricultural Economics Centre for Agricultural and Rural\nDevelopment Studies, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. The\nsurvey report reveals that DOB, Saw Dust and Wood\nChips\/Chipped Saw Dust have a surplus availability of 62.49%,\n2\n\n\nVCS Project Description Template\nreduction is limited to the actual amount of fossil fuel\nreplaced by biomass.\n1.5 Project location including geographic and physical\ninformation allowing the unique identification and\ndelineation of the specific extent of the project:\nThe ITC-PSPD, Coimbatore Paper Works, is located in\nThekkampatty village, Coimbatore District, Tamil Nadu State\n(76.97\u00baE, 11.01\u00baN). The proposed co-generation system will be\nlocated along the eastern periphery of the existing paper\nmill facility within the same premises.

The commercial production under ITC management began on\n29th March, 2004. The Mill earlier had a single board machine\nwith a capacity of 65000 TPA. With the increase in the\ncompetitiveness of the Unit it has further potential to make\n90000 TPA1 of Recycled Boards for Indian and export markets.\nPrior to project initiation, the Unit used to meet its need\nof process steam through in-house steam generation utilising\npredominantly lignite as a fossil fuel and a negligible\nproportion of biomass residues such as DOB and Saw Dust (1.5%\nin terms of energy). The biomass residues as a practice were\nused exclusively for boiler start up. During December 2003\nand January 2004 biomass residues were fired as a trial run\nprior to the implementation of the project activity. However,\nduring the baseline period of 2002 to 2004, proportion of\nfiring of biomass residues was as negligible as 1.5% of the\ntotal energy input. To meet the electrical energy\nrequirements of the plant the Unit was dependent exclusively\non the electricity imported from grid.\nWith regard to the agro based residues, the earlier practice\ninvolved partial disposal of the major proportion of the agro\nresidues in the fields or are fired in the open. This\nresulted in decaying of biomass in anaerobic condition\nleading to methane emissions and where the biomass is burnt\nin the fields, N O was emitted. 2\n1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG emission\nreductions and\/or removal enhancements:\nThe project utilized biomass residues (agro residue mix of\nprimarily saw dust, de-oiled rice bran and also some amount\nof chipped saw dust) available in the region of its operation\nas primary fuels. In the absence of the project, the ITC\nwould have run the co-generation plant based on 100% lignite.\nThus, by using biomass residues as fuel, the project actually\ndisplaces fossil fuel (lignite) and thus reduces GHG Emission\n1 Source: http:\/\/www.itcpspd.com\/aboutus\/aboutus.html. Addition of power block and de-inking facility (removal of\nink from waste paper) will increase the competitiveness of the Unit, with potential to make 200000 TPA of Recycled\nBoards for Indian and export markets.\n5","output":"{'crediting_period_start': '2006-03-28', 'crediting_period_end': '2016-03-27'}"}

The program is claiming a February 15th, 2015 start date for this project to include\nthe maximum allowable amount of activity.\nEvidence of the project\u2019s start date can be found in the ages of the trees included in this project. Trees\nare planted virtually every day in TIST Uganda. The oldest trees in the project were 5 years old at the\ntime data was pulled. As such, the best possible estimation for the project start date is February 1st,\n2015.20\nTIST quantifiers are trained to assess the age and species of trees. The program sets an internal goal to\nquantify trees every 18 months. More frequent quantifications than the required 5-year interval allow TIST\nto accurately measure the age of individual trees. These ages are incorporated into our database when\ntrees are young (and easier to ascertain the age of the tree). Through the individual counting and\nmonitoring of trees, the program is able to establish the minimum and maximum age of trees in individual\ngroves. This monitoring takes place in conjunction with consultation of farmers who can speak to the age\nof their seedlings.\nThe TIST database automatically rolls forward tree ages. As such, a data set run on February 01, 2020\nwill include trees planted 5 years (but no more) previously. Thus, the program can assess a February 01,\n2015 start date of the activities that led to the generation of GHG emission reductions.\n2.1.15 Benefits Assessment and Crediting Period (G1.9)\nFebruary 1st, 2015 \u2013 February 1st, 2075\n2.1.16 Differences in Assessment\/Project Crediting Periods (G1.9)\nAccounting periods will be the same between GHG and CCB impacts.\n2.1.17 Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals\n20 Appendix 01, Strata, columns J and L\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3\n23","output":"{'crediting_period_start': '2015-02-01', 'crediting_period_end': '2075-01-31'}"}

Due to the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in the paddy soil under flooded conditions, a large amount of methane can be released, so the intermittently flooded method is more conducive to water efficiency, improving rice yield and reducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.\\r\\nThe implementation activities of the project include promoting intermittently flooded technology, technical training for the farmers, facility repair and replacement, etc. According to the needs of rice growth, farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in the rainy season.\\r\\nThe project is expected to reduce GHG emissions by 416,395 tCO2e in the first seven-year period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 59,485 tCO2e. The project aims to reduce GHG and mitigate climate changes, increase rice productivity resulting in higher living standards for local farmers and provide more job opportunities.', 'project_state_province': 'Chongqing', 'project_country': 'China', 'project_latitude': 28.47, 'project_longitude': 106.4}"}

It will help to reduce thermal power generation in the SIN by providing renewable\nenergy to the grid. Thus, it will contribute to sustainability by increasing the share of renewable energy\nand reducing GHG emissions. The expected average annual emission reductions are 32,102 tCO during 2\na renewable 10-years crediting period.\nMoreover, the project activity will facilitate the achievement of electricity demand required for the social\nand economic development of the country based on a renewable energy source.

The']]\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\n1.13 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation\nPrior to the initiation of the project, several conditions exist that are unsustainable and\ncontribute to the emission of greenhouse gases. A significant one is crop burning. Crop burning\nis a common practice in sugarcane farming in the area. This is typically done to remove the\nexcess leaves and stems after the harvesting of the sugarcane. This process results in the\nrelease ofsignificant amountsofGHGsanddepletessoilfertility.\nSecondly there are inefficient farming practices such as overuse of fertilizers, pesticides, and\nirrigation, which can also contribute to GHG emissions. Overuse of fertilizers leads to the\nrelease ofnitrousoxide, whileinefficient irrigationpracticescanlead tothewasteofenergy.\nAll this is connected to a lack of awareness among farmers about the harmful effects of crop\nburning andother inefficient farmingpractices.\nThe project has not been implemented to generate GHG emissions for the purpose of their\nsubsequent reduction, removal or destruction. Instead, the project aims to reduce GHG\nemissions by addressing the conditions mentioned above. And to demonstrate this, the project\nwill promote sustainable farming practices, and conduct awareness campaigns to inform\nfarmers about the harmful effects of crop burning and the importance of sustainable farming\npractices. The project will establish a monitoring and reporting system to track the project's\nimpact on reducing GHG emissions. Overall, byimplementing these strategies, the project aims\nto address the underlying conditions that contribute to GHG emissions in the sugarcane\nfarmingindustry.\n\uf0b7 Hasthelandbeenclearedofnativeecosystemswithin10yearsoftheprojectstart\ndate?\n\u2610 Yes \u2612 No\n25","output":"{'project_name': 'Strengthening capacity through regenerative solutions for native sugarcane farmers in Maharashtra, India', 'project_summary': 'The objective of the proposed VCS Sustainable Agricultural Land Management (SALM) project activity aims to transition the farmers into practicing more sustainable cultivation practices in sugarcane production.

The\nintermittent irrigation method requires that in the process of rice cultivation, irrigation and\ndrainage can be controlled by ditches and valves according to the growing needs of rice. The low\neconomic level leads to the low income of farmers, which means that farmers do not have the\nadditional financial capacity to afford the construction of cement ditches that can implement\ncontrolled irrigation and drainage. Therefore, the project has not yet been implemented to\ngenerate greenhouse gas emissions for subsequent reduction, removal, or destruction.\n11","output":"{'project_name': 'Letung Water Management with Rice Cultivation', 'project_summary': 'The project carried out changes from a continuously flooded regime to an intermittently flooded regime during rice cultivation in Ledong Li Autonomous County (hereinafter \u2018Ledong County\u2019), Hainan Province, China, with a total acreage of 12,687 ha of double-cropping rice. Without the project, there would be no ditches, pumps, valves, and reservoirs to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously flooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario.

Thus, the project\u2019s contribution towards sustainable development\nhas been addressed based on the following sustainable development aspects:\nSocial Well-being: Project activity instances of this grouped project are reducing specific fossil fuel\nconsumption per unit of output generation by adopting energy efficiency measures in existing steam\nturbines. Hence, helps in reserving the fossil fuel resource and reducing the dependency up to a certain\nextent. Project activity instances will boost country\u2019s energy security by contributing in efficient way. Also,\nhelps in reducing GHG emission associated with the operation of fossil fuel fired captive power plant.\nEconomic Well-being: The project activity will also create business opportunities for contractors,\ntechnology consultants and suppliers in terms of retrofit\/modification and supply of existing turbine. Thus,\nproject activity would bring economic benefits for the local community and would lead to sustainable\neconomic and industrial growth in the region and country.\nEnvironmental Well-being: The project activity instances are reducing fossil fuel consumption per unit of\nbaseline output generation thus reducing the GHG emission associated with the generation through\nenergy efficiency measures, thus help in reduction in further exploitation and depletion of fossil fuels. The\nelectricity generated from the project activity would help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and other\nassociated pollutants from fossil fuel based thermal power plant; equivalent of which would have been\nemitted in absence of the project activity.\nTechnological Well-being: The project activity employs the energy efficiency measures by retrofitting in\nexisting steam turbines which reduces the specific fuel consumption in fossil fuel fired captive power\nplant. Thus, encouraging the captive power generating industrial units for adopting such measures which\nwill enhance energy efficiency in the industry and helps nation to grow in sustainable manner.\nFurther Information\nThe initial project instance is coming in First-of its-kind WEG facility.\n2 APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY\n2.1 Title and Reference of Methodology\nThe project activity instances as part of the proposed grouped project activity will be small scale \u201cSupply\nside energy efficiency improvements \u2013 generation\u201d project activity instances.

Identification of Alternative to the project  activity consistent with current laws and regulations  \n \nSub-step 1a. Define alternatives to the project activity \n \nAccording to the status of China Power Grid, four alternative scenarios were c onsidered for the proposed \nproject: \nAlternative Scenario (a), The proposed project ac tivity undertaken without being registered as a CDM \nproject activity; \nAlternative Scenario (b), Construction of a fuel-fi red power plant with equivalent amount of annual \nelectricity generation; \nAlternative Scenario (c), Construction of a power plant using other sources of renewable energy with \nequivalent amount of annual electricity generation; and \nAlternative Scenario (d), Continuation of the current s ituation. Electricity will con tinue to be generated by \nthe existing generation mix operating in the grid. \n Alternative scenario (c), power plant using other sour ces of renewable energy with equivalent amount of \nannual electricity generation could be a wind farm  or a biomass power plant in current technology \nconditions. A wind farm is not commercially viable due  to costly capital investment. There are some wind \nfarms in the same area, however, some wind farms had been registered as CDM projects\n2 and some wind \nfarms are in the processes of registering as CDM project3. And it is not know there is a biomass power \nplant in the same area. So the altern ative scenario (c) is not considered as a feasible alternative scenario to \nthe proposed project.  \nOutcome of sub-step 1a : The realistic and credible alternative scenarios are scenario (a), (b) and (d). \n Sub-step 1b.

There are no laws compelling the project developer to develop \nhydroelectric plants, thus alternative scenario (a) and (d) are in line with all applicable laws and \nregulations. \n The main sectoral policy relevant to this project activ ity is the promotion of renewable energy in China, \nthe Renewable Energy Law of the People\u2019s Repub lic of China, which came into effect on 1\nst January \n2006. This law demonstrates the Chinese Government\u2019s  commitment to the development of renewable \nenergy as part of the overall energy developmen t strategy, and encourages grid-connected power \ngeneration from renewable sources.
