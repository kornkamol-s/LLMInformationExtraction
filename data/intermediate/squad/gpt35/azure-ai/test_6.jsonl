{"input":"Question: Who were the ESPN Deportes commentators for Super Bowl 50?\n\nContext: On December 28, 2015, ESPN Deportes announced that they had reached an agreement with CBS and the NFL to be the exclusive Spanish-language broadcaster of the game, marking the third dedicated Spanish-language broadcast of the Super Bowl.

The game was called by ESPN Deportes' Monday Night Football commentary crew of Alvaro Martin and Raul Allegre, and sideline reporter John Sutcliffe. ESPN Deportes broadcast pre-game and post-game coverage, while Martin, Allegre, and Sutcliffe contributed English-language reports for ESPN's SportsCenter and Mike & Mike.","output":"['Alvaro Martin and Raul Allegre', 'Alvaro Martin and Raul Allegre', 'Alvaro Martin and Raul Allegre']"}
