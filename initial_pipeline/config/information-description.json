,"other_entities" : "This section details additional organizations and individuals involved in the project, highlighting their roles and contributions. It includes the names of companies, their brief descriptions, and key contacts responsible for various aspects of the project, such as technical assistance, project design, capacity building, and ecological assessments"
,"ghg_emission_reduction" : "This category includes detailed information on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions or removals achieved by the project. It encompasses annual records of estimated emissions reductions, total estimated reductions over the project period, the total number of crediting years, and the average annual emission reductions."
,"project_version" : "The version number of the project documentation, indicating revisions and updates."
,"date_issue_of_project" : "The date when the project documentation was officially issued or published."
,"project_start_date" : "The date on which the project is scheduled to commence or has commenced."
,"project_lifetime" : "The total duration of the project from start to completion, often expressed in years."
,"expected_first_vintage_of_credit_issuance" : "The anticipated year in which the first credits from the project will be issued."
,"project_country" : "The country where the project is being implemented."
,"project_location" : "The specific geographical location or site where the project activities are taking place."
,"project_summary" : "A brief overview of the project, summarizing its objectives, activities, and expected outcomes."
,"standard" : "The validation standard refers to the specific guidelines or principles that govern the project's compliance and assessment."
,"project_size" : "The project size refers to the total area covered by the project, measured in hectares."
,"natural_catastrophe_climate_change" : "This category evaluates the impact of natural disasters and climate change on the projectâ€™s insurability and viability. It includes an assessment of risks such as fire, drought, flood, and tropical cyclones. For example, the evaluation might reveal significant findings like a low immediate risk of fire, but a need for proactive strategies due to potential future risks. Drought risks are analyzed using various indices, indicating trends and the necessity for mitigation efforts. Flood assessments may show low overall risk but highlight localized variations, while tropical cyclone risks are assessed as negligible, enhancing the project's overall viability and insurability."
,"additional_analysis" : "This category assesses the project's additionality by evaluating its necessity in the context of existing environmental pressures."
,"leakage_analysis" : "This category examines potential leakage risks associated with the project, focusing on the likelihood and extent of leakage due to an overestimated baseline and possible activity displacement beyond designated areas."
,"baseline_analysis" : "Baseline Analysis evaluates the foundational assumptions and conditions that inform project crediting. It includes concerns about overestimated baseline scenarios and discrepancies in reporting."
