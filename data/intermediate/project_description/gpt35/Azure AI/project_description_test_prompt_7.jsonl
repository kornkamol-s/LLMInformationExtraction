Executing agents carry out the development of REDD+ projects and certify under\nstandards approved by the Governing Body.\nTo this extent, the Evergreen REDD+ is maintaining an ongoing conversation with SisREDD+,\nSEMA and PPCD-AM in order to integrate as soon as possible with jurisdictional programs, and\nfor Carbonext to continue to be a leader in the domain of JNR REDD+.\n1.12 Project Location\nThe Evergreen REDD+ Project (hereafter \u201cthe project\u201d) is situated in Apu\u00ed municipality in the State\nof Amazonas, in the Southern Amazon. The municipality is located around 1,000 km from\nManaus, Amazonas State capital. The Project Area belongs to Ituxi Administra\u00e7\u00e3o e Participa\u00e7\u00e3o\nLtda (represented by Ricardo Stoppe Junior), and Renan Vitoriano Boehm, and is covered 100%\nby native vegetation, totaling 130,554.8 ha. The northern project boundary lies approximately\n20 km from the city of Apu\u00ed, the western boundary is close to, or at points touching, the Aripuan\u00e3\nRiver, and the eastern boundary is flanked by the unofficial local road, the Estrada da Coruja,\nand is within some 20 km of the Acari river. The full contour coordinates of the project area are\navailable upon request.\nThe primary means of access to the project is via road, the main one is leaving southwards from\nthe city of Apu\u00ed, Amazonas State, on the Estrada da Coruja, in the State of Mato Grosso (MT). This\njourney must be done by 4x4 and is only feasible during the dry season (from May to September).\nThe second option is by road and then by boat, taking the boat the Trans-Amazonian Highway\n(BR-230) from Apu\u00ed towards Vila do Carmo, AM until reaching the Aripuan\u00e3 River, and then\nsouthwards by boat for 100km, at which point the river meets the project\u2019s Southwest corner.\nHowever, this river has several waterfalls, making it difficult to reach the area during the dry\nseason.\nIn accordance with VCS requirements, stipulated in Approved VCS Methodology VM0007, version\n1.6, the project area may only include areas composed of \u201cforest\u201d for a minimum of ten years\nprior to the project start date.

The wind farms is in two different states of India, namely Rajasthan (38.4 MW) and Tamil\nNadu (12 MW). A total of 63 Wind Electric Generators (WEGs) of 800 kW capacities each is\ninstalled at the sites, of these 48 WEGs is installed at Jaisalmer in Rajasthan and 15 WEGs is\ninstalled at Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu. The project leads to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and\nprovide clean renewable power to the Indian Grid.\nScenario Existing Prior to Start of the Implementation of the Project Activity\nThe electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by\nthe operation of grid-connected fossil fuel dominated power plants (also the baseline scenario).\nProject Scenario and the Technology employed\nThe project activity consists of 63 nos. of Enercon1 make 0.8 MW WEGs totaling to a capacity of\n50.4 MW. The WEG generates 3-phase power at 400V, which is stepped up to 33 KV. These\nWEGs are based on gearless technology, which helps in eliminating mechanical losses. It also\ncombines the variable speed with variable pitch and hence increases the conversion efficiency.\nThis technology is well established and running successfully at various sites in India\nContribution to reduction in GHG emissions by the project activity\nWith the implementation of the project activity, the electricity generated from wind turbines is\nsupplied to the Indian Grid which are dominated by fossil fuel based power plants thereby\nreducing an equivalent amount of GHG emissions, associated with thermal energy generating\nsources of the Indian Grid. The project thus helps in bridging the demand supply gap by using\nwind as a source of generating electrical energy.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nProject Type: Renewable energy project\nThe project activity falls under Sectoral Scope 1: Energy industries (renewable - \/ non-\nrenewable sources\nThis project is not grouped project because there is no addition other project activity.\nThis is non-AFLOU type of project.\n\n[['', 'Organization name', '', '', 'M\/s Wind Urja India Private Limited', ''], ['', None, None, None, None, None], ['', 'Contact person', '', '', 'Mr. Atul Nangare', ''], ['', None, None, None, None, None], ['', 'Title', '', '', 'Authorized Signatory', ''], ['', 'Address', '', '', 'The IL&FS Financial Centre, Plot C- 22, G Block, Bandra Kurla', ''], ['', None, None, None, 'complex, Mumbai \u2013 40051, Maharashtra', None], ['', 'Telephone', '', '', '+91 8657422549', ''], ['', 'Email', '', '', 'atul.nangare@ilfsindia.com', '']]\n[['', 'Organization name', '', '', 'EKI Energy Services Limited', ''], ['', 'Role in the project', '', '', 'Project Consultant', ''], ['', 'Contact person', '', '', 'Mr. Pankaj Rajpoot', ''], ['', 'Title', '', '', 'Assistant Manager- Operations', ''], ['', 'Address', '', '', 'Office No 201, Plot No 48, Scheme 78, Vijay Nagar Part- II, Indore', ''], ['', None, None, None, '452010, India', None], ['', 'Telephone', '', '', '+91- 7828347589', ''], ['', 'Email', '', '', 'pankaj@enkingint.org', '']]\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\n1.3 Project Eligibility\nThe project activity involves installation and generation of electricity using wind energy\nresources i.e. by using the renewable sources replacing electricity supply from a fossil-fuel\ndominated electricity, thus leads to reductions of anthropogenic GHG emissions from\natmosphere.

However, intermittent flooded water regime\nrequires that irrigation and drainage can be controlled according to the growth needs of rice\nduring its cultivation. Whereas, the low economic level leads to the low income of farmers,\nwhich means that farmers have no additional economic capacity to afford the construction\nof cement ditches which can practice controllable irrigation and drainage. So, the project has\nnot been implemented to generate GHG emissions for the purpose of their subsequent\nreduction, removal, or destruction.\nSince the conditions existing prior to the project initiation is the same as baseline scenario,\nplease refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario) to see the detail information. Besides, this\nproject does not affect the environmental conditions, including climate, hydrology,\ntopography, soils, relevant historical conditions, type of vegetation, ecosystems, etc., so, the\npresent and prior environmental conditions of this project are the same, which are listed as\nfollows.\n11 The ex-ante investigation report of Zengdu District in 2019 from Hubei Academy of Social\nSciences\n13","output":"{'project_name': 'Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation In Zengdu District', 'project_summary': 'The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Zengdu District within Suizhou City, Hubei Province of China, with a total acreage of 13,336ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\\r\\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 4.42tCO2e\/ha for single-cropping rice is expected.

{"input":"Question: What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?\n\nContext: \n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\n1 PROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nThe aim of the project is to facilitate the roll-out of conservation agriculture (CA) in regions of\nSouth Africa where it is not prevalent. The intention is to at a minimum, assist farmers to replace\nconventional cultivation practices with the three essential components of CA \u2013 no till, cultivating\na variety of species and the maintenance of organic cover through the year.\nTo facilitate the initial adoption as well as long-term maintenance of these essential components\nand potential additional activities, a broad set of activities are required that are centred around\nthree goals:\n\u2022 To address the lack of regionally specific awareness, knowledge, evidence and models.\n\u2022 To build regional technical support programmes and peer networks based on trust and\nevidence, and\n\u2022 To create an attractive financial incentive package to sustain implementation over the\nlong-term.\nIn terms of a broad strategy, a bottom-up participatory approach will be followed working with\nexisting programmes, farmer study groups, farming organisations and institutions to increase\nawareness and knowledge of the opportunity in an effective and efficient manner. In a similar\nmanner, regional expertise and research will be drawn upon to develop the supporting science,\nmonitoring methods and financial models. Such an approach not only improves the viability of\nthe underlying activities but creates the trust and buy-in required to sustain implementation over\nthe full project period.\nThis approach is based on the proven concept of farmer innovation platforms where the\nengagements and interaction are farmer centred. Farmers are seen as the principal restoration\nagents and practitioners. Their innovation, involvement and support are vital to ensure\nfundamental change over the medium to long-term. We will therefore facilitate a process that\nfocuses upon the farmer to also create the maximum benefits to the farmer given their respective\nclimatic and geophysical contexts. Enhancing soil carbon is therefore not the sole aim of the\nproject, but also to ensure a fundamental change in farming practices that leads to the long-term\nenhancement of soil health and the system-wide resilience of food, income and job security.\nA grouped project approach will be taken where the intention is to add farms (project instances)\nover time that meet all eligibility criteria. The initial set of identified farms are expected to lead to\nGHG emission reduction and removals of approximately 106,000 tCO e per year or 3,180,000 2\ntCO e over a 30-year project period. 2\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nSectoral Scope: 14.
