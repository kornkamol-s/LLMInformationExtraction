The Indian power sector is dominated by\nfossil fuel based power plants. It is to be noted here that wind power generation as a\npercentage of the total power generated in the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu\n& Karnataka is 9%, 12%, 29% and 13% respectively1. Hence, project activity helps in\nimproving the environmental performance of the power sector in India.\n1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG\nemission reductions and\/or removal enhancements:\nThe project activity involves production of electricity from a non-polluting and renewable\nenergy source, i.e. Wind Power. The project activity is contributing to grid based\nelectricity which is primarily produced in fossil fuel based power plants (63%)2. Hence\nthe project activity is displacing electricity that might have been procured from a fossil-\nfuel based grid supply.\n1.9 Project technologies, products, services and the\nexpected level of activity:\nIn wind energy generation, kinetic energy of the wind is converted into mechanical\nenergy and subsequently into electrical energy. Wind turbines capture the wind's energy\nwith two or three propeller-like blades, which are mounted on a rotor, to generate\nelectricity. The turbines sit high atop towers, taking advantage of the stronger and less\nturbulent wind. As the wind blows through the blades of the windmill, a pocket of low-\npressure air forms on the downwind side of the blade. The low-pressure air pocket then\npulls the blade towards it, causing the rotor to spin. The rotor turns the shaft that further\nspins the connected generator. The spinning of this generator produces the required\nelectricity. The technology is clean since there are no GHG emissions associated with the\nelectricity generation.\nTechnical details of the installed WTGs are as follows:\nSouthern Wind Farm (GWL 225)\n1 CEA Monthly Installed Capacity Report dated 30\/11\/2008\nWind Power India Installed wind capacity Report dated 30\/11\/2008 (latest available)\n2 CEA Monthly Installed Capacity Report dated 30\/11\/2008\n9","output":"{'project_name': 'Pawan Urja Vistaran: Small entities combined wind power project in India - 2008', 'project_summary': 'The project activity encompasses Wind Power Projects spread across the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in India.

The project was implemented by Anhui\nUnited Venture Renewable Energy Technology Co., Ltd. in Taihe County, Fuyang City, Anhui\nProvince.\nThe raw materials (i.e. livestock and poultry waste) was collected and transported to the project.\nAfter pre-treatment, the biogas was produced in anaerobic digestor, and then entered the\ngenerator to generate electricity after desulfurization. The slurry produced by anaerobic\nfermentation is transported through pipe network and utilized in nearby farmland to create an\norganic ecological recycling industry. The residue is used to produce solid organic fertilizer.\nBefore the implementation of the project, manure from livestock and poultry farms were treated\nby uncovered anaerobic lagoons without biogas recovery, while east China Power Grid provided\nthe same amount of electricity. This is also the baseline scenario for the project. The successful\nimplementation of the project not only reduces environmental pollution and realizes greenhouse\ngas emission reduction, but also develop clean biomass energy, effectively utilize resources and\nachieve sustainable development of agriculture industry.\nIt is estimated that the project can handle 548 tons\/day of livestock and poultry waste generated\nby livestock and poultry farms in Taihe county, with an annual treatment capacity of 200,000\ntons. The project uses organic waste to produce biogas and organic fertilizer, and builds a biogas\npower station with a total installed capacity of 2.4MW and an estimated annual power supply of\n14,400MWh. Construction of the project began on 20\/5\/2020, with two generator units\nsimultaneously constructed, and the commissioning started from 17\/8\/2021. All electricity\ngenerated is supplied to the grid.\nThe project activity will reduce GHG in the atmosphere through avoiding methane emissions from\nanaerobic treatment of manure. The project adopts a 10-year fixed crediting period, It is\nestimated that 62,834 tCO2e emission reductions will be generated annually and total emission\nreductions are 628,338 t CO2e in the crediting period.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\n4\n\n[['', 'Organization name', '', '', 'Anhui United Venture Capital Renewable Energy Technology Co.,Ltd.', ''], ['', 'Contact person', '', '', 'HongYan Li', ''], ['', 'Title', '', '', 'Project manager', ''], ['Address', 'Address', None, '', 'No.111 A3 Baoya Kaixuanmen, east of Taihe Street, Taihe County, Fuyang', ''], [None, None, None, None, 'City, Anhui Province, China.', None], ['', 'Telephone', '', '', '+86 13311136362', ''], ['', 'Email', '', '', 'lilyguan0308@163.com', '']]\n[['', 'Organization name', '', '', 'Beijing Qianyitan Management Consulting Co., Ltd.

She said that since these investors had their wind turbines in the village land, she felt it was \nnecessary to discuss this with villagers and inform them of the same. It was for this reason that these \ninvestors had requested her to represent their organizations. Other source of energy such as diesel, \ncoal etc. is polluting sources but in case of wind there is no pollution. Also, her experience with wind \nhad taught her that with such developments happenings in villages, it is also followed by employment \ngeneration, better amenities such as good roads, etc.  \n \nCommon Queries from the Stakeholders and responses by the project proponents are listed below: \n \n1. Will the Project help in improving the electricity supply to the villagers\/village school? \n \nYes. It has definitely improved the electricity supply in the surrounding region as power \ngenerated from wind is fed to state electricity grid. It has improved the energy efficiency in \nthe region. Wind energy is powering the homes, protecting the environment and improving \nthe living standard of the people of surrounding villages. \n \nThe villagers are getting benefitted as now they are getting light in night too. Since last few \nyears, Literacy rate has increased in the region as now children can study in evening hours \ntoo. Due to improved electricity supply, villagers can save money which was earlier spent on \nKerosene for lighting purposes. Also, the project activity produces electricity without any \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. On the one hand, it is contributing towards meeting the \nenergy deficit in Rajasthan, on the other, by reducing green house gas emissions; it is helping \nin mitigating climate change at national and at global level. \n \n2. Do these Projects affect the rainfall? \nNo, such projects do not affect the rainfall by any chance. Clouds bearing rainfall are usually \nat the height of 300m and the WTG is not higher than 80m. \n \nDiscussions between representative of Project Proponents and the Stakeholders are as follows: \n \n1. Are there any other benefits of wind power projects that you have observed?

Wood from\ndeforestation is delivered and utilized in the ceramic facility and\nthis non renewable biomass is offered with low prices.\nAlthough firewood from deforested areas has been used for many decades\nas fuel in Brazil, it is impossible to define a start date on which\nthis kind of non-renewable biomass began to be applied. Firewood used\nto be the most employed source of primary energy until de decade of\n1970, when the petroleum started to supply the majority of Brazilian\u00b4s\nenergy needs.4 Moreover the Brazilian\u00b4s Energy and Mine Ministry has\nbeen monitoring all energetic sectors of Brazil since 1970, and\nfirewood appears over the years monitored as a significant source of\nthermal energy for ceramic sector5.\nAccording to Seye (2003),6 in Brazil, the red ceramic units are produced\nthrough an inefficient and traditional process using wood without\nforest management to generate thermal energy. In this industry segment,\nthe use of wood represents about 98% of the total fuel employed.\nTherefore, the employment of this fuel stimulates the increase in\nBrazilian deforestation rates. The baseline identified for this project\nactivity is the employing of an average of 1,397.27 m\u00b3 of non-renewable\nnative wood per month to provide thermal energy to the ceramic\u2019s kilns.\nThe project activity focuses on the use of wood residues from\nindustrial waste, (like pallet, sawdust, and wood chips) and other\nresidues from Pinus manufacturing process as renewable biomasses for\nenergy supply.\n1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG\nemission reductions and\/or removal enhancements:\nThe emission reductions will be achieved by displacing the use of wood\nfrom areas with no sustainable forest management to provide thermal\nenergy in the ceramic company. Therefore, the emissions launched during\nthe combustion of native wood from deforestation activities were not\noffset by the replanting, which is a carbon absorbance method. An\n1 Date on which the project began reducing or removing GHG emissions, i.e. when\nthe project proponent began employing renewable biomass. At this date, the\nceramic acquired the first quantity of renewable biomass.\n2 Date on which the project proponent completed the fuel switch of Marac\u00e1\nceramic, thus, when the ceramic stopped employing native wood.\n3 Date on which the project activity completes 10 years after the date on which\nthe project proponent completed the fuel switch.\n4 Source: BRITO, J.O.

Description of the small-scale project activity:\nThe Maoshaping Hydro Power Project (hereafter, the Project) developed by Yangbi Heihuijiang Electric\nPower Development Co., Ltd (hereafter referred to as the Project Developer) is a small-scale run-of-river\nhydropower project in Yunnan Province, in China (hereafter referred to as the \u201cHost Country\u201d). Total\ninstalled capacity of the Project will be 7.5 MW, consisting of three 2.5MW turbines. The project will\nannually generate 40,530 MWh and supply a predicted amount of 40,327 MWh of electricity to the\nYangbi County Power Grid, then to the Yunnan Power Grid, finally to the China Southern Power Grid.\nThe purpose of the project is to utilise the hydrological resources of the Yangbi River through\nconstruction of a run-of-river hydro project to generate zero emissions electricity for the China Southern\nPower Grid (hereafter referred to as the \u201cGrid\u201d). The electricity currently generated by the grid is\nrelatively carbon intensive, with an operating margin emission factor of 1.0040 tCO \/MWh and a build 2\nmargin emission factor of 0.5736 tCO \/MWh. The project is therefore expected to reduce emissions of 2\ngreenhouse gases by an estimated 31,810t CO e per year during the first crediting period. 2\nThe project is contributing to sustainable development of the Host Country. Specifically, the project:\n\u2022 Increases employment opportunities in the area where the project is located (15 people will be\npermanently employed for the project operation and the construction of the project secures jobs in\nthe construction sector)\n\u2022 Enhances the local investment environment and therefore improves the local economy\n\u2022 Diversifies the sources of electricity generation, which is important for meeting growing energy\ndemands and the transition away from diesel and coal-supplied electricity generation\n\u2022 Makes greater use of renewable hydroelectric resources\n\u2022 Contributes to poverty alleviation through income and employment generation.\nA.3.

Hence the project activity is eligible sectoral scope 1 i.e., energy industries\n(renewable\/ non-renewable sources) under the scope of the VCS Program. In line with\nmethodology, project activity may displace electricity from fossil fuel fired captive power plant or\ndisplaces electricity from carbon intensive mini grid.\nAs the electricity produced by the project activity of LCW involved in the project is primarily\nintended to be used by the captive consumers and excess of the electricity to be supplied to the\ngrid, 100% of the electricity generated by the solar PV units is to be accounted for emission\nreduction, even though the project is grid-connected, given that the main purpose is the delivery\nto the captive consumer.\nFor the instances mentioned in the following table, the monthly electricity consumption bills from\nthe respective state electricity board have been submitted to VVB, with which it can be concluded\nthat the scope of surplus energy availability to export to grid is next to impossible. Hence, the\nproject not export greater than 50% of generated electricity to the grid.\nTable- 3\nTherefore, the project does not fall in the excluded category as per Table 1 of the VCS Standard\n4.52 & the project eligibility in the VCS program is justified.\n1.4 Project Design\n\u2612 The project includes a single location or installation only\n\u2610 The project includes multiple locations or project activity instances, but is not being developed\nas a grouped project\n\u2610 The project is a grouped project\nEligibility Criteria\n2 https:\/\/verra.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/VCS-Standard-v4.5-updated-11-Dec-2023.pdf \u201cpage 3, Grid-\nconnected electricity generation activities using wind, geothermal, or solar photovoltaic (PV) power plants.\u201d\n6","output":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}
