It involves the installation of 33 turbines, each of which has a rated\noutput of 1500kW, providing a total installed capacity of 49.5 MW, with a predicted power supplied to\nthe grid of 113,800 MW annually.\nThe purpose of the project is to generate power through wind energy thereby reducing greenhouse\ngas(GHG) emissions in electricity generation in the Northwest China Power Grid(NWCPG). The\nproposed project is therefore expected to reduce emissions of GHG by an estimated amount of 105,754\ntonnes of CO2 per year.\nThe baseline scenario of the proposed project is the additional power generated by NWCPG, and it is the\nsame as the existing scenario prior to start of the implementation of the project activity. As the NWCPG\nis dominated by the thermal power generation, the proposed projects activity will achieve greenhouse\ngas(GHG) emission reductions by displacing the electricity from NWCPG.\nThe project activity will promote the local and national sustainable development powerfully in the\nfollowing aspects:\n\u00a4 Achieves GHG emission reductions by avoiding electricity generation from fossil fuel-fired\npower;\n\u00a4 Increase employment opportunities in the area where the project located(approximately 4\npeople1 will be permanently employed for the project operation, besides, the construction of the\nproject will provide job vacancies ) and thereby contributes to the local economy;\n\u00a4 Help to stimulate the growth of the wind power industry in China;\n\u00a4 The proposed project could be helpful to diversify power structure of Northwest China Power\nGrid and reduce the dependence on exhaustible fossil fuels for power generation.\nA.3.

Following the\nsuggestion, the water and solid waste should have no significant impact on the environment.\n(cid:2) Impacts on telecommunications and television transmissions\nSince set of substation will be constructed in the project, the electromagnetism impact of the project\nshould be evaluated. Based on the analogies of the built wind-farms, the result concludes that the\noperation of wind farm will not have electromagnetism impact on the nearby enterprises and residential\nareas that are 10 km away from the wind farms. Therefore, the electromagnetism of this project in the\noperation phase doesn\u2019t impact the production and daily life of nearby enterprises and residents.\n(cid:2) Impacts on Ecosystem Environment\nThe proposed wind power project is located in a barren and desolate area with sparse vegetation, exposed\ndust and high soil erosion. Moreover, the installed height of turbines is lower than the winged height of\nthe birds. So there are no significant impacts on migratory birds \/ endangered species in the region of the\nproject activity. Therefore, the activities to be carried out will not generate any negative impact on the\necological environment.\n(cid:2) Socio-Economic Impacts\nThe project is estimated to supply annually 113,800MW\u2022h of power to the Gansu Power Grid and to save\nabout 35500tce. So the project generates eco-friendly, GHG free power that contributes to sustainable\ndevelopment of the region. Moreover, the project activity not only helps the uplift of skilled and\nunskilled manpower in the region, but also improves employment rate and livelihood of local populace in\nthe vicinity of the project.\n(cid:2) Conclusion\nThe project activity does not have any major adverse impacts on environment during its construction and\noperational phase. The project is definitely an environmentally more friendly way of providing power\nthan others power plants.\nD.2. If environmental impacts are considered significant by the project participants or the host\nParty, please provide conclusions and all references to support documentation of an environmental\nimpact assessment undertaken in accordance with the procedures as required by the host Party:\nThe construction and operation of the proposed project have no significant environmental impacts, and\nthe proposed project is definitely an environmentally more friendly way of providing power than other\npower plants.\nThis template shall not be altered.

Lastly, regular contact is maintained with stakeholders to assess the effectiveness of the\nmeasures.\nIt is important for CLIMIT that stakeholders participate in the identification and evaluation of\nimpacts and their corresponding measures to mitigate the impact, since this allows the\nstakeholder to have the opportunity to contribute or resolve their doubts and that the measures\ntaken to mitigate the impact are agreed between all parties.\nOnce an agreement is reached to mitigate the impacts of the mentioned activities, the project\nowner and proponent must inform the stakeholders of the activity to be carried out with its\ncorresponding scope and ways of working of the activity to be developed. Then they should\nexplain the preventive measures that will be carried out for this activity.\n3 A M PPLICATION OF ETHODOLOGY\n3.1 Title and Reference of Methodology\nThe methodology applied is AR-ACM0003 \u201cA\/R Large-scale Consolidated Methodology:\nAfforestation and reforestation of lands except wetlands\u201d (Version 02.0).

Version 02.0 of AR-TOOL15 \u201cEstimation of the increase in GHG emissions attributable to\ndisplacement of pre-project agricultural activities in A\/R CDM project activity\u201d.\n3.2 Applicability of Methodology\nThe project activities meet the applicability conditions of the methodology given that:\n\u25cf The project area does not correspond to wetland, but instead to grasslands under beef-\ncattle grazing.\n\u25cf Given that the soils in the project are not organic, and the grassland cover is moderately\ndegraded with low to null inputs, soil disturbance is not restricted, However, it must be\nnoted that the disturbance is minimal given both that the tillage necessary for the planting\nof the trees is localised (wide corridors which are not planted reduce the net area) and the\ndistance between rows is higher than in a typical high-density plantation.\nThe applicability conditions of the tools are met as well:\n1. No laws are being violated through the project activities. As a project, the afforestation\nand reforestation activities are not considered small-scale, for it is a grouped project\nwhich will include multiple instances of the silvopastoral systems with CO sequestration 2\nin the tree biomass.\n2. Soil disturbance may occur every 14-20 years only if replanting activities happens\nfollowing the timber harvest. The land preparation at that moment will not occur at the\nsame place, but between the rows. New trees are planted in the alleyways, which have not\nbeen disturbed for at least 28-40 years. Some other projects will manage the natural\nregrowth occurring from the stump and land disturbance will not happen in 28-40 years.\n3. No fire is used for land preparation or clearance; therefore the tool will only be used in the\ncase of an accidental forest fire.\n4. There is not displacement of activities which would result in drainage of wetlands or\npeatlands.\n51","output":"{'project_methodologies': ['AR-ACM0003']}"}

Conversion of Low Productive to High Productive\nForest by climber cutting and enrichment planting and prevention of unsustainable logging.\n1.3 Estimated amount of emission reductions over the crediting period\nincluding project size:\nIt is estimated that project results into a net emission reduction benefit of 4,140,409 tCO -e 2\nwithin a Crediting Period of 30 years in a rehabilitated area of 25,000 hectares. This value is\nnot corrected for a non-permanence buffer.\n1.4 A brief description of the project:\nThe project rehabilitates 25,000 ha of severely logged-over mixed dipterocarp rainforest in\nSabah, Malaysia and prevents relogging of the forest in this area. In the absence of the project\nactivity, the forest would be re-logged and would only slowly recuperate due to the high\nquantities of vines and climbing bamboos suppressing the remnant trees and the natural\nregeneration process.\nThe project is called INFAPRO which is an acronym for Innoprise-Face Foundation\nRainforest Rehabilitation Project. INFAPRO is the collaborative project between Rakyat\nBerjaya and Face the Future. Rakyat Berjaya is responsible for the field project, which\ncontains implementation and management of the forest rehabilitation activities. Face the\nFuture holds the carbon sequestration rights and is responsible for the carbon development\naspect of the project.\nIn 1992 Rakyat Berjaya and the Face Foundation (the predecessor of Face the Future) signed\na contract with the objective of carbon sequestration through the joint implementation of an\nenrichment planting forestry project on Yayasan Sabah\u2019s now largely logged-over concession,\nin direct vicinity of the Danum Valley Conservation Area. The resulting INFAPRO project is\na large-scale rainforest rehabilitation project aimed at the rehabilitation of 25,000 ha of\nheavily degraded logged-over rainforest. In doing so, the project enables the sequestration of\nlarge volumes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, thus combating climate change.\nINFAPRO is supported by the Government of Sabah in a Memorandum of Understanding\nbetween the State of Sabah and Face.\nThe INFAPRO project is divided into two phases. The first is the implementation phase\nwhich covers the first three years of each contract and is under the shared financial\nresponsibility of Face the Future and Rakyat Berjaya. Activities within this phase are\nimplemented by Rakyat Berjaya. The second phase is the subsequent management phase,\nwhich covers the following 96 years, which is under responsibility of Rakyat Berjaya. As a\nwhole, the project results in the prevention of short-term re-logging and rehabilation of a\nseverely degraded logged-over rainforest.\n4","output":"{'crediting_period_start': '2007-01-01', 'crediting_period_end': '2036-12-31'}"}

The project is\nnot a grouped project.\n2.1.11 Project Activities and Theory of Change (G1.8)\nThe project aims to increase carbon sequestration and contribute to local sustainable development by\nplanting trees on the barren hill and degraded lands. 50,061ha (705,916 Mu) of forest were directly\nafforested on degraded lands in Zunyi City, including 1 district and 7 counties: Bozhou district, Tongzhi\ncounty, Suiyang county, Zheng\u2019an county, Daozhen county, Wuchuan county, Meitan county, Xishui\ncounty. According to the Biodiversity Survey Report of the project, all the project areas were previously\nbarren land without agricultural activities. There was no natural renewal and reforestation before the\nproject, and some sites were covered by sparse shrub. Therefore, the project does not include activities\nthat convert native ecosystems to generate GHG credits, which means the eligibility criteria of VCS\nAFOLU projects are fulfilled.\nThe species of ecological public welfare forest in the karst area mainly include Pine, China fir, Cypress,\nToonasinersis, Populusadenopoda, Dodonaeaviscosa, etc.. Among them Pine, China fir and Cypress are\nthe main forest species to control karst rocky desertification in Guizhou, because they have strong\nadaptability Guizhou. Pine and China fir, Cypress are prominent in rocky desertification areas due to their\nfast growth, shallow rooting and strong adaptability to the soil. They are all suitable afforestation species\nin limestone mountainous areas of subtropical monsoon climate zone.\nThe implementation of the project would generate GHG emission removals and improve local\nenvironment through growing trees, enhancing the capabilities of local communities and residents by\nproviding their relevant technical skills and training, and increasing local biodiversity by establishing a\nforest of native trees (China fir, Cypresses, Pinus yunnanensis and Masson pine).\nThe project is estimated to generate GHG emission removals of 21,225,014 tCO e in 29 years, with an 2\naverage annual GHG emission removal of 731,897 tCO e. 2\nTheory of Change\nAs explained in the following sections, the without project scenario may have three focal issues:\n(1) Continued low activity and interaction of local communities and community groups;\n(2) Degraded welfare conditions due to invasion of rocky desertification into the settlements of local\ncommunities;\n(3) Threat local climate conditions and biodiversity due to continued rocky desertification.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 23","output":"{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}"}

The long-term average GHG benefit (LTA) is determined by averaging\nthe expected total GHG benefit for the length of the project (100 years: from 30\/10\/2016 \u2013 until\n30\/10\/2116). The project will remove a total amount (LTA) of 2,021,823 tCO2 during a period of 100\nyears. This means an average of 20,218 tCO2 per year (estimated annual emission reductions and\nremovals). The financing of the project is achieved through a Trust fund that invests in land, forestry\nplantation and management activities. These investors look for safe and predictable rates of return\nwherein carbon certification is a plus to guarantee these attributes. The project contributes to the\nsustainable development of Uruguay, specifically by:\n\u2022 Increasing labour demand from the local population: the common activity developed in the\nproject region is livestock production. Besides the forestry plantation activities, the project will\nmaintain the cattle raising both on the unplanted area and under its plantations from year 2 to\nthe end (any local researchers support cattle breading inside forests as animals suffer less\ntemperature stress and for storms protection). This will generate a much larger demand of labour\nwhen compared to these activities being developed separately.\n\u2022 Adding value to wood products and diversifying the regional production will lead to higher\neconomic revenues for the region.\n\u2022 Contribute to create a new sustainable resource into the country, that will allow the development\nof new processing facilities in an economically depressed area.\n\u2022 Increase the demand of scientists to investigate issues like plagues, biodiversity, forests growth\nmodelling, etc.\n\u2022 Promoting an integrated management scheme with the ecosystem. In this sense, the plantations\nalready obtained the necessary approval from the DINACEA (National Directorate of Environment)\nand the plantations are certified under the FSC standard.\n\u2022 Developing and improving a new mechanism to finance projects in the forestry sector.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThe activity implemented by the project is the establishment of forests on land that had previously been\nunder grassland, and therefore corresponds to the VCS scope 14: \u201cAgriculture, Forestry and Other Land\nUse\u201d as an Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR). \u2018Fideicomiso Financiero Forestal Montes\ndel Este\u2019 project is a single GHG Project.\n\u2022 Sectoral scope: 14 (Agriculture, Forestry, Land Use)\n\n\u2022 Category: Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR)\n\u2022 Activity type: establishment of forests on land that had previously been under grassland for more\nthan 50 years.\n\u2022 Fideicomiso Financiero Forestal Montes del Este Project is a single GHG Project.\n1.3 Project Eligibility\nThe project is eligible under the scope of the VCS Program as the project includes AFOLU activities (project\ncategory ARR) which are supported by a methodology approved under the VCS Program.\nThe project was designed in accordance with the VCS General Requirements (VCS Standard v4.2) and it\ncomplies with the specific AFOLU ARR project category requirement that the project area was not cleared\nof native ecosystems to create GHG credits. The grassland vegetation dominating before project start\nwithin project boundaries is not the native ecosystem of the land. The native condition was modified by\nthe introduction of beef cattle and sheep in the 17th and 19th centuries, respectively, and by the\nintroduction of exotic species during the last three centuries.\nThe project is located over degraded pasture areas, in areas categorized as \u201cforest priority soils\u201d.\nAccording to Article 5 paragraph A of Forestry Law No. 15,939, \" forestry priority areas are considered\n\"those soils that, due to their properties, aptitude, climate, location and other characteristics, are\nunsuitable for any other permanent and profitable exploitation or use\"1. Uruguay, by means of this Law\nand its associated norms, recognizes the need to take advantage of this type of soils and has promoted\nfor years the implantation of forests over them, by means of incentives such as: Subsidies and tax\nexemptions. This has been strongly regulated by MGAP and the Ministry of Environment.\nRegarding the ecosystem, the pasture vegetation with cattle ranching that dominated before the project\nbegan is not the native ecosystem of the land. The native state was modified by the introduction of cattle\nfrom Europe in the seventeenth century and, together with advances in transportation and the\nmeatpacking industry, substantially modified the ecosystems that were part of Uruguay's landscapes at\nthat time. The introduction of cattle, sheep and horses by the European colonization strongly modified\nthe original landscape of the R\u00edo de la Plata grasslands, generating a great loss of native grasslands, at\nleast in their pristine state2. In the case of Uruguay, the condition of the grasslands was altered with the\nincorporation of cattle (non-native species) more than 400 years ago by Europeans, especially by\nHernando Arias de Saavedra (Hernandarias)3.\nIn fact, Felix de Azara (Spanish military man, naturalist and geographer), following his observations during\nhis travels in South America at the beginning of the 19th century, describes that what happens in natural\n1 Suelos de prioridad forestal. 2021.

PER 1 wind power plant has a total installed capacity of 48.6 MW and PER 2 wind\npower plant has 28.8 MW installed capacity, totalizing 77.4 MW. Based on the technical data of the\nequipment installed and also in the local wind assessment performed by Garrad Hassan, the load factors\nof the two wind power plants are expected to be 41% (equivalent to 3,592 operating hours). Considering\nthe total installed capacity, the load factors and the wind power plants self electricity consumptions, the\nexpected annual electricity generation is of 174,552 MWh for PER 1 wind power plant and 103,438 MWh\nfor PER 2 wind power plant, totalizing 277,990 MWh\/yr.\nThe project is developed in Rawson Department, Chubut Province, in the southeast region of Argentina,\nnamely The Patagonia. The GHG mitigation activity will be lead by GENNEIA S.A. Both wind power\nplants are located in contiguous sites and controlled by the same operator.\nPER 1 and PER 2 wind power plants aim at reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by delivering\nzero emissions generated electricity to the National interconnected system. The proposed umbrella\nproject will contribute to the displacement of currently operating fossil-fuel based thermal power plants\nalso delaying the construction of new thermal power plants.\nThe baseline scenario corresponds to the operation and provision of electricity by the currently existing\npower generation mix and, in addition, the potential thermal power plants that would have been built and\nentered into operation dispatching electricity to the grid without the implementation of the PER 1 and PER\n2 wind power plants. This scenario is the same as the one existing prior to the implementation of the\nproposed project activity. Fossil-fuel based thermal power plants produce electricity with lower project\ncapital expenditures (CAPEX) than renewable power generation plants. Thus, for large scale power\nprojects, private investors had always preferred to participate in fossil-fuel thermal power generation\ninitiatives. Consequently, the CDM registration of the proposed umbrella project activity (77.4 MW total\ninstalled capacity) will contribute to mitigate climate change by supplying zero GHG emissions electricity\nto the grid (neither fossil-fuels are used to generate electricity nor to operate the wind power plants),\ndisplacing fossil-fuel based power plants (CO emitters derived from the oxidation of fossil-fuels) and 2\nshowing an alternative way for private investors to participate and promote large scale power generation\nby means of renewable energy sources.\nThe emission reductions are estimated according to the actual start date of the plants (1 January 2012 for\nPER 1 and 20 January 2012 for PER 2). Thus actual generation has been 163,074 MWh for PER 1 and\n91,252 MWh for PER 2 until the end of the crediting period (6 December 2012). Corresponding emission\nreductions are 121,462 tCO for PER 1 and 67,967 tCO for PER 2 (using the 2012 grid emission factor). 2 2\nPER 1 and PER 2 wind power plants contribution to sustainable development could be observed at the\nlocal, regional and global levels, since it will bring clean energy to the national grid, will avoid local\npollutant emissions derived from fossil-fuel based thermal power generation, will contribute to cover part\nof the national energy demand with low electricity generation costs, will preserve non-renewable\nresources as an economic value and energetic assurance for those cases where there are no existing\nalternatives to fossil-fuel consumption, will increase the local employment levels during the construction\nphase activities, and will implement a state-of-the-art technology for power generation and grid\ndistribution, at a large scale not yet implemented as such in the country.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThe sectoral scope is number 1, Energy Industries (Renewable \/Non-renewable sources), and the project\ntype is wind energy.

The energy\ngenerated is sold to the National Interconnected System of Colombia. The purpose of the project\nis renewable electricity generation to be supplied to Colombian power grid.\nThe project activity considered the production of clean hydroelectric power using a flow of water.\nThe project collects the waters of the Guadalupe River at 2,089 meters above sea level, driving\nthe water through an open channel to the sedimentation unit. The water passes through a closed\nchannel to a load tank, moving to a pressurized conduction penstock and a distributor, where the\nflow is directed to one Francis turbine. The turbine is hosted in a surface power house with their\nrespective generator, valves and control panels. The substation is located besides the power\nhouse. As the project plant is a run-of-river hydro, a reservoir is not utilized.\nThe project will generate electricity for the Colombian power grid with low emissions technology.\nThe power plant will have an effective capacity of 9.741 MW1(rated capacity of turbine2), with a\npredicted power supply to the grid of 64.3 GWh per year. Thus, the project will increase the\nsupply of electricity to the grid, offsetting thermal generation with a renewable source of energy,\nand consequently reducing greenhouse gases emissions.\nThe project was implemented by Guanaquitas S.A. E.S.P, a public services company created in\n2008 with the purpose of assuming the electric energy generation, transmission, distribution and\nmarketing functions. The design, construction and installation were developed by the engineering\ncompany HMV Ingenieros Ltda.\nThe plant started construction on 26\/03\/2008, started operation on 30\/06\/2010 (commissioning\ndate), and has been in operation since then. The project activity is expected to reach an\nemissions reduction of 21,973 tCO2 per year and 219,730 tCO2 during the entire crediting period.\nDuring monitoring period from 30\/06\/2010 to 02\/10\/2013 (both days included), the project activity\nachieved an emissions reduction of 77,183 tCO2.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nSectoral scope 1: Energy industries (renewable - \/ non-renewable sources).

The project is promoted by individual sub project investors, the details of which are as\nfollows:\nThe purpose of the project activity is to generate energy electricity by the utilization of solar power\nand further selling the generated energy to the respective Grid or for captive purpose. In this\nprocess there is no consumption of any fossil fuel and hence it does not lead to any greenhouse\ngas emissions. Thus, electricity would be generated through sustainable means without causing\nany negative impact on the environment. The estimated annual average GHG emission\nreductions from the project activity will be 17,567 tonnes of CO2 and total GHG emission\nreductions for the chosen 10 year crediting period will be 175,670 tonnes of CO2.
