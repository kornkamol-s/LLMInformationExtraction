Under the Lands Act of\n2005, customary tenure is recognized under section 7 (1). The local communities therefore,\nhave the full rights to environmental goods and services that include biomass and soils in\ncustomary areas.

However, the intermittent flooding system requires that the irrigation and\ndrainage be controlled according to the growth needs of the rice during the rice cultivation\nprocess. In fact, the low economic level has led to low incomes of farmers, which means that\nfarmers do not have the additional economic capacity to build cement ditches with controlled\nirrigation and drainage. Therefore, the project was not implemented to generate greenhouse gas\nemissions for subsequent reduction, removal or destruction.\nSince the conditions existing prior to the project initiation is the same as baseline scenario,\nplease refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario) to see the detail information. Besides, this project\ndoes not affect the environmental conditions, including climate, hydrology, topography, soils,\nrelevant historical conditions, type of vegetation, ecosystems, etc., so, the present and prior\nenvironmental conditions of this project are the same, which are listed as follows.\n13","output":"{'project_name': 'Huiluo Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation', 'project_summary': 'The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Huishui County and Luodian County, Guizhou Province, where located in southwestern China with a total acreage of 19,066 ha for single-cropping rice.

The native ecosystem of the project area would be forest29 if not for a long history\nof human-caused impacts to the area. Evidence that the project area was cleared of native\necosystems more than 10 years ago is provided in Figure 3 and in more detail in Figure 15.\nThe VCS eligible planting areas shown in Figure 15 were mapped in a two-stage process. First,\nJuly 2013 Landsat 8 data was classified as either forest or non-forest using training areas and\nrandomforest. Then non-forest polygon boundaries within the proposed planting area were\nadjusted by hand to align with Google Earth high resolution imagery from 2009-2012. For a small\nportion of the area not covered in Google Earth, Bing imagery was used after it was established\nthat the Bing imagery was also from 2012 by comparing the location of farms in the parts that\noverlapped with Google Earth. The mapped non-forest areas were overlayed on Sentinel-2 data\nfrom July 2021 to look for any evidence of reforestation. No natural regeneration was found. A\ncouple planted pine plots were found, which were used as a basis for adjusting the planting area\nboundaries to avoid all areas with potential for pine planting (see Figure 11).\nIn addition to the mapping described above, a point-based sample of land-cover was conducted.\nOne hundred random points were generated within the project area polygon boundaries. The land-\ncover was interpreted for 2012 using sub-meter Google Earth and Bing imagery and for 2021 using\nSentinel-2 imagery from July, August and Planet.com base maps from June and July. From the\n2012 high resolution imagery, three land covers were identified; herbaceous thicket dominated by\nbracken ferns, active farm, and herbaceous thicket with scattered trees not meeting the definition\nof forest. Most of the trees in the latter class were so small that they were not clearly visible in 2021\nsince the highest resolution data available was 4-meter Planet.com basemaps. Not a single point\nfell into an area with trees that would add up to a patch of forest more than 0.5 ha, which is the\nminimum area threshold for forest in Tanzania. The results (Figure 5) show little change apart from\na statistically insignificant increase in the proportion under active farms.\nFigure 5. Results of land-cover point assessment\n28 CDM requires that A\/R project areas be non-forest since 1989, but the document \u201cAFOLU Guidance: Additional\nguidance for VCS Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation projects using CDM Afforestation\/Reforestation\nMethodologies\u201d provided by Verra clarifies that the VCS standard supersedes this requirement for A\/R projects\nvalidated under VCS.

The fuel switching has\nbeen carried out by Combio Energia S.A., a company whose main activity is the production and\ndistribution of steam, hot water and air conditioning.\nFounded in 1969, Nexa\u2019s Tr\u00eas Marias unit, formerly Votorantim metals, is the main metallurgical\ncompany that carries out the processing of zinc in Brazil. In 2017, the company was responsible\nfor the production of 186 thousand tons of zinc. Since its initiation, Nexa has utilized BPF oil to\nsteam generation.\nOn 02-October-2015 Nexa signed a contract with Combio in which Combio would generate and\nprovide the steam necessary to the zinc processing. Combio started operating inside the Nexa\nindustry on 06-March-2017 commercializing steam generated at the hybrid boiler (flamotubular\nand aquatubular) using renewable biomass as fuel, which defined the project start date.\nThe implementation of this project activity has the objective of drastically reduce the use of BPF\noil and substitutes it with renewable biomass to generate steam to sustain Nexa\u2019s production, with\nthe intention of minimizing environmental impacts including the reduction of Greenhouse Gases\n(GHG) emissions.\nThe switching of fossil fuel to renewable biomass is expected to reduce an average of 58,519\ntCO e per year during the first crediting period of the project.

Without the\nimplementation of this project, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the\nscenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario.\nSince the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of\nmethane (CH ) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is 4\nmore beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction\nthan the continuously flooded.\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results\nin not only large amount of methane (CH ) emissions but also low rice productivity by 4\nreplacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens\nthe period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH emission 4\ncan be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an\nestimated amount of GHG emission reduction 4.47 tCO e\/ha for single-cropping rice is 2\nexpected. Annual average estimation of GHG emission reductions from the project activity\nis 55,884 tCO e\/year, and the total GHG emission reductions are 558,840 tCO e during the 2 2\nfixed 10 years crediting period.\nThis project aims to:\n- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;\n- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;\n- Increase the number of local individuals who have relevant skills due to diversified\neducational opportunities from trainings;\n- Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThe project is developed under VCS scope 14 \u201cAgriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use\n(AFOLU)\u201d with an activity category of Improved Cropland Management (ICM) under\n1 Dr. Reiner Wassmann (2016).

This condition continues because\nof economic conditions of the farmers as well as lack of knowledge regarding advanced\nirrigation technologies like intermittent flooded water regime. Intermittent flooded water regime\nrequires that irrigation and drainage can be controlled according to the growth needs of rice\nduring its cultivation.\nThis project was implemented for farmers to practice the intermittent flooded water regime,\nthus increasing the rice yield and promoting agricultural sustainable development.\nSince the conditions existing prior to the project initiation is the same as baseline scenario,\nplease refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario) of the PD to see the detail information. Besides,\nthis project does not affect the environmental conditions, including climate, hydrology,\ntopography, soils, relevant historical conditions, type of vegetation, ecosystems, etc., so, the\npresent and prior environmental conditions of this project are the same, which are listed below.\n16","output":"{'project_name': 'GHG EMISSION REDUCTION THROUGH INTERMITTENT FLOODING IN RICE FIELDS', 'project_summary': \"The project activity is an 'Alternate wetting and drying (AWD)' activity that is a water saving strategy in irrigated rice production. The main objective of the project is to switch from continuously flooded rice fields to fields that alternately encompass flooded and non-flooded phases which can save significant amount of irrigation water. Thus, the project activity has been designed to change from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation which is conducted in different blocks in the district of Bhopal, Hoshangabad, Raisen and Sehore of the state of Madhya Pradesh, in India. A total of 8,085 hectare for single-cropping rice has been covered under the project activity. During rice cultivation, controllable irrigation and drainage according to rice growth requirements can save water resources, and also at the same time will also reduce methane emission from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions (in the flooded state). Additionally, in the project activity compost will be used for soil application in the rice fields and thus replace the application of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer.

This date is December 11, 2010.7\n1.6 Project Crediting Period\nThe project crediting period for the project activity will be 10 years. Options to re-validate the\nproject activity for an additional 10 years will be re-evaluated upon completion of first 10 year\ncrediting period.\nAs such the crediting period for the project activity shall commence from October 10th 2011 end\non October 9th 2021.\n1.7 Project Scale and Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals\nUnlike traditional utility scale projects that hope to utilize biomass for process heat or electricity\nbased on 365 day a year operations, Metrolina\u2019s heating needs are seasonal and are directly\nrelated to the interaction between optimum growing environment temperature and the outside\ntemperature. Greenhouse growers of this scale and location utilize most of their heat during the\nwinter months, mainly October through May or approximately 36 weeks.\nBased on historical natural gas usage information and capacity of the biomass boiler system, the\nproject activity could realize up to 25,000 tCO2e annually and therefore qualifies as \u201cproject\u201d\nscale category. Table 1 below shows the estimated emission reductions from the project over the\nentire crediting period using ex ante calculations. However, due to the direct relationship between\nthermal energy use\/need, and the temperature outside the growing environment, actual emission\nreductions will vary year to year.\nA spreadsheet is provided estimating these ex-ante emission reductions8.\n7 Vyncke Certificate of Commissioning\nv3.1 5\n\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version\n3.1\nMetrolina plans to construct an additional facility located at the Huntersville Concord location,\nhowever, the area under consideration for construction, is located in an area which must remain\nphysically distinct from the existing project boundary due to the property being transected by the\nPlantation Pipeline.13 This pipeline separates the northern and southern portions of land owned\nby Metrolina, and due to right of way considerations, Metrolina is not allowed to build directly\nupon or transect this pipeline in any way. This fact demonstrates that any additional planned\nfacilities (capacity increases) are not related to the project activity.\nMost commercial greenhouse operations in America rely heavily on petroleum based fossil fuels,\nincluding natural gas. This commonplace dependence is attributable to the existing infrastructure,\nlow cost and minimal labour required for operating and maintaining such systems.\nFurthermore, there are no statutory regulations or provisions compelling the use of other fuel\ntypes.\n1.11 Compliance with Laws, Statutes and Other Regulatory Frameworks\nThe project activity complies with all local laws and regulations applicable to production of thermal\nenergy for self-use in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina and the United States. There are\ncurrently no regulatory requirements mandating reduction of GHG emissions from thermal energy\napplications at facilities in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina or the United States regarding\ncommercial greenhouse operations.\nMetrolina has obtained and complied with all electrical, building and construction permit\nrequirements.\nMetrolina has obtained the permit needed to operate the biomass boiler system, i.e. Mecklenburg\nCounty Permit to Construct\/Operate.14 This permit is only issued after a thorough review of the\nproject, which would include a review of above local construction, electrical, and building permits.\nIn the state of North Carolina, major air permits are issued at the county level, and county officials\nhave the necessary legal authority to issue them. Further information regarding air permitting and\ncompliance with local laws can be found on the Mecklenburg County Air Quality Air Pollution\nFacility Information portal page.15\n1.12 Ownership and Other Programs\n1.12.1 Right of Use\nMetrolina Greenhouses is the entity that demonstrates right of use. Metrolina has established the\nunencumbered ability to claim emission reductions from this project activity through its ownership\nof all equipment that produces emission reductions and the fact that it owns all facilities within the\nproject boundary.

Invitations were sent by\npostal letters and by e-mails. A detailed list of invitations was given to the VVB. In addition, a\npublic notice was posted at the local bus stop so that people who did not receive a personal\ninvitation could attend.\nIt was originally planned to hold an event in presence, showing the fields of the farm and\nexplaining the planned project activities on site. However, due to the devastating Covid-19\nsituation in the winter of 2021 in Germany, such an event was not possible. Therefore, the local\nstakeholder consultation was conducted online. After an introduction of all Project Proponents,\ndetailed information was provided on the impact of climate change on local agriculture, the\nrelevance of humus and the planned project activities. Great care was taken to ensure that the\ntopics were presented in such a way that they could be understood by people without in-depth\nexpertise as well as those with specialist knowledge. Afterwards, the attendees were invited to\nask questions and discuss with the Project Proponents. Among other things, the planned\nmeasures and financial challenges for farmers were discussed. Overall, the project received a lot\nof interest from the attendees and did not earn any negative comments.\nTo ensure ongoing communication, an email address was established for stakeholders to report\ncomments, requests or grievances. It was explicitly stated that any feedback is welcome.\n2.3 Environmental Impact\nThe project activity is designed to reduce the negative impact of agricultural activities on nature\nand climate. The applied regenerative practices aim at restoring and maintaining soil health and\nfertility, support biodiversity, protect watersheds, and improve ecological and economic\nresilience. By re-carbonizing soils via photosynthesis and biology, particularly on degraded land,\n20","output":"{'project_name': 'Future Soils and Sustainable Farming Initiative - Germany', 'project_summary': \"Germany's image as an industrialized country is dominated by vehicle and machinery manufacturers as well as producers of chemical products. The agricultural use of more than 50% of the country's land area is usually overlooked, although here too, successful industrial cultivation is predominant. Technical progress in fertilizers and pesticides, agricultural machinery, and cultivation methods, as well as advances in breeding and the yield-oriented transformation of agricultural landscapes have increased yields many times over in the last 100 years. However, an accompanying effect of this growth is a significant impact on the environment and the climate.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo reduce this impact while maintaining high yields, the Future Soils and Sustainable Farming Initiative aims to promote IALM (improved agriculture land management) practices in Germany. Designed as a grouped project under the VCS, the initiative\u2019s purpose is to encourage interested farmers to participate who meet the requirements. As its initial instance, the initiative starts with a farm located southeast of Berlin in the state of Brandenburg.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy applying regenerative practices, the participating farmers do not only support the global efforts to mitigate climate change by reducing and removing GHG, but also make their own soils more resistant to upcoming challenges such as longer periods of droughts or extreme weather phenomena.
