{"input":"Question: What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?\n\nContext: \n\n1 PROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nThe project carried out changes from a continuously flooded regime to an intermittently flooded\nregime during rice cultivation in Haikou City and Ding\u2019an County, Hainan Province, China, with a\ntotal acreage of 12,655 ha of double-cropping rice. Without the project, there would be no\nditches, pumps, valves, and reservoirs to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the\ntraditional continuously flooded method would be continued. The original scenario for rice\ncultivation by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter\nin rice soil under flooded conditions can emit a large amount of methane because of anaerobic\ndecomposition, the intermittently flooded method is more conducive to saving water, increasing\nrice yield, and reducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.\nThe implementation activities of the project include constructing high-standard farmland, annual\ntraining, conducting the intermittently flooded method, etc. According to the needs of rice growth,\nfarmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water\nresources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic\nconditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice\npaddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in\nthe rainy season. In this case, the methane emission can be declined by an average of 48%.\nHence, with the proposed project activity, the estimated GHG reduction from rice is 4.67\ntCO e\/ha. 2\nThe project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions by 413,602 tCO e in the first seven-year 2\nperiod, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 59,086 tCO e. The project aims to 2\nreduce GHG and mitigate climate changes, increase rice productivity resulting in higher living\nstandards for local farmers and provide more job opportunities.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThis project is categorized as sectoral scope 14 (AFOLU) under Verra as justified in Section 1.3,\nalthough the AMS-III.AU methodology applied is approved under sectoral scope 15 (Agriculture)\nof CDM.\nThe project is developed under VCS scope 14 \u201cAgriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)\u201d\nwith an activity category of Improved Cropland Management (ICM) under Agricultural Land\nManagement (ALM).\n\n[['Requirements', 'Evidence'], ['Eligible ALM activities are those that reduce net\\nGHG emissions on croplands and grasslands by\\nincreasing carbon stocks and woody biomass\\nand\/or decreasing CO , N O, and\/or CH\\n2 2 4\\nemissions from soils.', 'This project reduces CH emissions on croplands\\n4\\nby replacing the continuously flooded method\\nwith the intermittently flooded method.

This is by the\ndefinitions of eligible AFOLU project categories set out in Appendix 1 of the VCS Standard, v4.2,\nand can be demonstrated from the following three points.\nAccording to Section 2.1.1 of \u201cVCS Standard version 4.2\u201d, this project activity meets two of the\nscopes of the VCS program:\n1) The six Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gases.\n4) Project activities supported by a methodology approved under a VCS approved GHG\nprogram unless explicitly excluded under the terms of Verra approval.\nAccordingly, this project produces methane (CH ) emission reductions, which is one kind of the 4\nsix Kyoto Protocol GHGs. Besides, this project activity is supported by the CDM small-scale\nmethodology: Methane emission reduction by adjusted water management practice in rice\ncultivation which is approved under a VCS approved GHG program \u2013 United Nations Clean\nDevelopment Mechanism and is not explicitly excluded under the terms of Verra approval.\nTherefore, this project is eligible under the scope of the VCS program.\nThe project is an individual project, not a fragmented part of a larger project or activity.\n1 Evidence on Certificate of Eligibility for Land provided by the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureaus of Haikou City and Ding\u2019an Couty.\n5","output":"{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}"}

According to the\nlatest 2021 report of Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in China,\nChina will actively promote the integration of the 2030 Agenda with the 14th Five-Year Plan and\nother national development strategies, and focus on promoting high-quality development, social\ncoordination, and harmonious coexistence between people and nature in terms of economic\ndevelopment, innovation drive, people's well-being, and green ecology16. In particular, the\nproposed project activities directly contribute to 3 of the 4 goals:\n1. Promoting high-quality economic development: the project contributes: the project is\ndesigned to be a long-term cropland management program that operates in an\nunderdeveloped county. Through scientific and environmentally friendly sustainable\nmanagement, it will improve local crop yields, enhance agricultural quality, efficiency\nand competitiveness, and improve the development of a Chinese state-level poor\ncounty.\n2. Promote people's well-being and comprehensive development: the project is\ncommitted to generating extra income for the local rural communities with non-\ndiscriminatory practices and a safe working environment. The project framework and\nactivities have been designed and established under a framework of social impact\nthat not only includes income generating opportunities but follows a long-term plan\nof community engagement and indirect sustainable development activities, aimed at\ncreating a prosperous environment.\n3. Promoting green development and human-nature harmony: the project helps local\ncommunities to improve the efficiency of land resource use, prevent over-exploitation\nof land, and help stabilize environmental quality. At the same time, the project\nconveys the concept of green development to farmers through project activities and\ntraining, contributes to building a harmonious relationship between people and\nnature, and further helps the national government to cope with climate change and\nachieve the goal of carbon peaking by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.\nSpecifically, the Henan Runan Land Use Management Project aims to have a positive impact on\nthe following SDGs:\n16 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development\nhttps:\/\/www.fmprc.gov.cn\/web\/ziliao_674904\/zt_674979\/dnzt_674981\/qtzt\/2030kcxfzyc_686343\/zw\/\n19","output":"{'crediting_period_start': '2019-06-01', 'crediting_period_end': '2039-05-31'}"}

Therefore, it was confirmed that the project has not been implemented to\ngenerate GHG emissions for the purpose of their subsequent reduction, removal or destruction.\n1.11 Compliance with Laws, Statutes and Other Regulatory Frameworks\nThe project complies with all Chinese relevant laws and regulations. It also obtained the approval\nletters from governmental authorities: Development and Reform Commission (DRC), as well as\nEnvironment Protection Bureau (EPB) of Shandong Province. The two approvals well\ndemonstrate that local government permits the construction of the project. Consequently, the\nproject is compliance with laws, status and other regulatory frameworks.\n1.12 Ownership and Other Programs\n1.12.1 Right of Use\nThe business license is the evidence for right of use. The approval of FSR and EIA are evidences\nfor legislative right. Besides, the purchasing contract of wind turbine and the power purchase\nagreement are the evidences for the ownership of the plant, equipment and process generating.\n1.12.2 Emissions Trading Programs and Other Binding Limits\nThe project has been registered as a CDM project on 26\/01\/2012 with Ref No.5658, for which a\nrenewable crediting period of 3*7 years will be used under the CDM GHG Program. Therefore,\nCO emission reductions generated by the project during the CDM crediting period will be verified 2\nas unique CERs, but not VCUs to avoid double counting. As to the project under VCS standard\n(Version. 3.4), only emission reduction achieved from 12\/05\/2010 to 29\/02\/2012 will be\nconsidered as VCUs.\n1.12.3 Other Forms of Environmental Credit\nThe project neither has nor intends to generate any other form of GHG-related environmental\ncredit for GHG emission reductions or removals claimed under the VCS Program for the period\nfrom 12\/05\/2010 to 29\/02\/2012.\n1.12.4 Participation under Other GHG Programs\nThe project has been registered as CDM project and the registration number is 5658, the CDM\ncrediting period is form 01\/03\/2012 to 28\/02\/2019.\nv3.2 6","output":"{'project_name': 'Shandong Yishui Tangwangshan Wind Farm Project', 'project_summary': 'Shandong Yishui Tangwangshan Wind Farm Project (hereinafter referred to as the proposed project) is to utilize wind resources for electricity generation through the construction of a wind farm with a total capacity of 20.4MW in Yishui County, Shandong Province, P.

For\nthis project activity, the improved forest management consists in harvesting less than\nthe business as usual scenario1.\nBoth the baseline and project scenarios for the project area qualify as forests remaining\nas forests, such as set out in the IPCC 2006 Guidelines on National GHG Inventories.\nThe project area in the baseline scenario is part of the THLB, which is designated and\napproved for wood product management by a provincial regulatory body.\nThis project activity corresponds to the category: Logged to Protected Forest (LtPF).\nThis category includes practices that reduce net GHG emissions by converting logged\nforests to protected forests. By eliminating harvesting for timber, biomass carbon stocks\nare protected and can increase as the forest re-grows and\/or continues to grow. When\nundisturbed, carbon stock of forests remain stable over time.\nThus, this project is eligible under the scope of the VCS Program.\n1.4 Project Design\nThe project is designed as a single activity.

In the absence of the project\nactivity, equivalent amount of electricity would have been generated by the operation of fossil\nfuel dominated power plants. The electricity grid is power deficit and hence the new capacity\nhas to be added in the grid system which would be fossil fuel dominated electricity\ngeneration. The project is a Greenfield initiative.\n1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG\nemission reductions and\/or removal enhancements:\nThe project activity is a wind power project activity with a totalled installed capacity of 2.5\nMW and is expected to generate 4380 MWh per annum. The electricity thus generated is sold\nto MSEDCL.
