In the same\nvein, construction activities also have not caused noise pollution due to the\nisolated nature of the area.\nWater Pollution\nThere is no gaseous, liquid or solid effluent from the Wind Turbine\nGenerators. Hence there is no contamination of water bodies due to\noperation of Wind Turbine Generators.\nAir Pollution\nMinimal air pollution might have occurred during the construction of the\nProject due to transportation.

As suggested\nby the tool, it is assumed that the implementation of the project activity increases the SOC content of the\nlands from the pre-project level to the level that is equal to the steady-state SOC content under native\nvegetation. The increase in SOC content in the project scenario takes place at a constant rate over a period\nof 20 years from the year of planting. The project meets the applicability conditions of this tool since:\n\uf0b7 the areas of land to which the tool is applied do not fall into wetland category, do not contain organic\nsoils and are not subject to any of the land management practices and application of inputs listed\nin Tables 1 and 2 of the tool;\n\uf0b7 Since the land use prior to project start is grassland, only Table 2 applies. For the temperate warm\nmoist climate region corresponding to the project activity, none of the three combinations included\nin Table 2 are applicable;\n\uf0b7 litter remains on site and is not removed and soil disturbance is in accordance with appropriate\nconservation practices, limited to site preparation and not repeated within 20 years.\nTable 13. Parameters used for estimation of SOC\nSOC at the beginning of the project (SOC ) is estimated by multiplying the factors in Table 13 by the INITIAL,i\nreference SOC. As per the tool, a loss in SOC (SOC ) is applied in the case that soil disturbance occurs LOSS,i\non more than 10 per cent of the land area, which is the case of Guanar\u00e9\/FAS project.

(= AEG 5-units SET-5-\n). units\nThe gross electricity generation in year 2010 is taken as reference for determination of plants that\ncomprise 20% of the system generation. The gross generation in year 2010 was 211,207.70 GWh\n(Table 11) in 2010 out of this amount 7,053.40 GWh was identified34 to be produced by projects that\nclaimed VERs, excluding this number from the gross generation we end up with 195,992.70 GWh of\nelectricity which is our AEG and 20% of that amount is calculated as 39,198.54 GWh.

As suggested by the tool. it is assumed that the implementation of the project activity\nincreases the SOC content of the lands from the pre-project level to the level that is equal to the steady-\nstate SOC content under native vegetation. The increase in SOC content in the project scenario takes\nplace at a constant rate over a period of 20 years from the year of planting. The project meets the\napplicability conditions of this tool in the area managed with rubber plantations:\nThe areas of land to which the tool is applied do not fall into wetland category, do not contain organic\nsoils and are not subject to any of the land management practices and application of inputs listed in\nTables 1 and 2 of the tool.\nSince the land use prior to project start was grassland, only Table 2 applies. For the Tropical, moist\nclimate region corresponding to the project activity, none of the three combinations included in Table 15\nare applicable; litter remains on site and is not removed and soil disturbance is in accordance with\nappropriate conservation practices, limited to site preparation and less than 10%. As the main goal of the\nproject is not the wood harvesting, but the rubber. Not additional site preparations will be developed at\nleast for the first 35 years of the rubber productivity cycle (less than 20 years).\nThe initial SOC stock at the start of the Project is estimated as follows:\n(4)\n= SOC stock at the beginning of the A\/R CDM project activity in stratum\ni of the areas of land; t C ha-1\n= Reference SOC stock corresponding to the reference condition in\nnative lands (i.e. non-degraded. unimproved lands under native\nvegetation \u00f1 normally forest) by climate region and soil type\napplicable to stratum i of the areas of land; t C ha-1\n= Relative stock change factor for baseline land-use in stratum i of the\nareas of land; dimensionless\n= Relative stock change factor for baseline management regime in\nstratum i of the areas of land; dimensionless\n= Relative stock change factor for baseline input regime (e.g. crop\nresidue returns. manure) in stratum i of the areas of land;\ndimensionless\n= 1. 2. 3. \u2026 strata of areas of land; dimensionless\nThe values of SOC . f . f . f are presented in Table 15.
