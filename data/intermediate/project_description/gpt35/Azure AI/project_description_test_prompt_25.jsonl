It is offsetting\nfossil fuel use and lowering greenhouse gas emissions while helping the country to cope with the\ngrowing demand of energy.\nThe approved EIA mainly results in showing that the project is not harmful to the environment and\ndoes not report any impact on endangered species.\nBesides, thanks to its implementation, the project will contribute to raise the awareness on climate\nchange among the local community (through the stakeholder meeting) or at a larger scale through\nthe donation of part of the CER revenue to the Vietnam Environment Protection Fund (for further\ndetails, please see the \u201ceconomic benefits\u201d).\nB - Social benefits\nThe project is improving the local economy through local employment during both the\nconstruction period (short-term jobs) and the operation (long-term jobs) of the plant. Some of\nthese jobs require high level of expertize which is contributing to the increase of the local\nstandard of living. The local knowledge will also increase due to the transfer of technology.\nFinally, it has to be highlighted that this project activity is of large scale and that no residential\nland is impacted. Thus, no indigenous people have to resettle due to the implementation of the\nproposed project activity.\nv3.1 7\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nC - Economic benefits\nIn Viet Nam, all CDM registered projects are especially beneficial for the local community.

{"input":"Question: What is the methodology of this project?\n\nContext: \n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nSection 2.2 details the ideas and comments made by the stakeholders (Local Stakeholder\nConsultation section). The hazards associated with the project's implementation are the main\ntopic of this section. No risk has been reported overall.\nRisks to local population\nThere are no risks associated with the local population. The impacts on populations are mainly\npositive.\nFood security of local populations\nThe progressive degradation of the soil brought on by monocropping in agriculture would restrict\nthe development of agricultural crops. However, the agroforestry design based on the block,\nboundary, and intercropping models will naturally provide nitrogen and carbon to the soils.\nIncreased crop quality results from increased soil fertility, which increases farmer returns.\nIncreased incomes\nThis project will increase farmer\u2019s incomes through the sale of agricultural production, fruits and\ntimber, as well.\nNegative impacts of the project on local populations are negligible.\nThe grievance redress procedure will be set up as stated in the rules and requirements of the VCS\nstandard v4.3:\n1) The project proponent shall attempt to amicably resolve all grievances and provide a written\nresponse to the grievances in a manner that is culturally appropriate.\n2) Any grievances that are not resolved by amicable negotiations shall be referred to mediation by\na neutral third party.\n3) Any grievances that are not resolved through mediation shall be referred either to a)\narbitration, to the extent allowed by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction or b) competent courts in\nthe relevant jurisdiction, without prejudice to a party\u2019s ability to submit the grievance to a\ncompetent supranational adjudicatory body, if any.\nIf grievances of the landowner occur that could jeopardize the project performance or continuity\nthatwould be taken care by the project proponent.\n3 APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY\n3.1 Title and Reference of Methodology\nThe following methodologies have been adopted for the grouped project activity:\n21\n\n[['Applicability conditions', 'Justifications'], ['a) The land subject to the project\\nactivitydoes not fall into wetland\\ncategory', '(a) The lands selected under the project\\nactivity are privately owned agricultural and\\nfallow lands that do not come under the\\ncategory of wetland.

Description of the project activity:\n>>\nInner Mongolia Tongliao Wind Farm Project Phase IV is located in Kezuo Zhongqi, Tongliao City, Inner\nMongolia Autonomous Region, China. The proposed project will be constructed and operated by Guohua\n(Tongliao) Wind Power Co., Ltd. The objective of the proposed project is to utilize the wind power for\ngenerating electricity, which will be sold into the Northeast China Power Grid (NEPG). The total\ninstalled capacity of the proposed project is 49.5MW with 33sets of turbines and a unit capacity of 1,500\nkW. The estimated on-grid electricity supply is 108,600 MWh per year.\nThe proposed project activity will generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions by avoiding CO 2\nemissions from electricity generation by fossil fuel power plants and will contribute to sustainable\ndevelopment of the local community and the host country by reducing greenhouse gases (GHG)\nemissions of 121,480 tCO e per year. The project will therefore help reduce GHG emissions versus the 2\nhigh-growth, coal-dominated business-as-usual scenario. Furthermore, the project will improve air\nquality and local livelihoods, promote sustainable renewable energy industry development.\nThe baseline scenario, therefore, is the same as the scenario existing prior to the implementation of the\nproject activity, i.e. generation of electricity by grid connected power plants.\nThe proposed project clearly fits into the development priority of China. The proposed project will not\nonly supply renewable electricity to the grid, but also contribute to sustainable development of the local\ncommunity, the host country and the world by means of:\n\u2022 Reduce greenhouse gas emissions in China compared to a business-as-usual scenario;\n\u2022 Stimulating the growth of the wind power industry in China;\n\u2022 Creating local employment opportunity during the construction and operation period;\n\u2022 Reducing the emission of other pollutants resulting from the power generation industry in China\nA.3.

The number of operation and maintenance\npersonnel and management staff is small, so living water is in smaller discharge. The project will retain\nimpervious septic tanks in the construction period, so sewage can be discharged directly into septic tanks\nfor treatment in the standards.\nNoise environmental impact analysis\nThrough the monitoring and control of noise of the wind farm that has been completed, wind noise will\nhave no effect on the health of the people around the villages and operation personnel.\nConclusion\nWind Farm building can alleviate the pollution of the surrounding environment from the construction of\ncoal-fired power plant, have the role of use of renewable energy, conservation of fossil energy, reducing\npollution, protecting the ecological environment. Therefore, from the view of environmental protection,\nthe project is practicable.\nD.2.

These biomes are known to be of critical importance in sustaining local,\nregional and national water supply in Brazil [24, 25, 26]. Forests play an important role in the\nprovision of water-related ecosystem services [27], and the loss of these services through\ndeforestation is a major threat in the project area. It is suggested that the main reason for the\ngreat water crises of 2014-2017 in S\u00e3o Paulo was the deforestation in the water basins\nsupplying the area [26]. The reforestation of areas in these biomes is therefore an important\ncontributor to the restoration of water-related ecosystem services in the area.\nGoal 13: Climate Action\nThe TFF project\u2019s reforestation activities on unutilized and degraded farmland contribute to\nadditional GHG emission removals, and thereby contributes to the reduction of climate hazards.\nThe trainings provided to the workers involved in the project, and the communication to other\nstakeholders, generate awareness of sound environmental practices.\nGoal 15: Life on Land\nThe TFF project specifically aims to make a positive contribution to the local biodiversity.

Please refer to Section 3.3 for the boundaries of the project area and project\nzone is shown in Figure 1-3, and the KML file has also been submitted.\n7The ex-ante investigation report mainly investigated the natural environment, farmers' income,\nand rice planting status in the project area before the project started, such as rice cultivation\nsystem, water management practice, straw utilization, and fertilizer use, etc.\n8\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nSichuanProvince\nFigure 1-1The map of China\nFigure 1-2 The map of Chengdu City in Sichuan Province\n9\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nFigure 1-3The map of project zone-Dujiangyan City in Chengdu City\n1.13 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation\nPrior to the project initiation, economic conditions in the project area are not very good and\nthe level of education is relatively low8, so farmers lacked advanced irrigation technologies,\nsuch as the intermittent flooded water regime. However,intermittent flooded water regime\nrequires that irrigation and drainage can be controlled according to the growth needs of\nrice during its cultivation. Whereas, the low economic level leads to the low income of\nfarmers, which means that farmers have no additional economic capacity to afford the\nconstruction of the branch ditches which can practice controllable irrigation and drainage.\nToimprove the infrastructure conditions of agricultural production, increase food production,\nand promote sustainable agriculture, the project was implemented. Therefore, the project\nwas not implemented to generate GHG emissions for the purpose of their subsequent\nreduction, removal, or destruction.\nSince the conditions existing prior to the project initiation is the same as baseline scenario,\nplease refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario) to see the detail information. Besides, this\nproject does not affect the environmental conditions, including climate, hydrology,\ntopography, soils, relevant historical conditions, type of vegetation, ecosystems, etc., so,\n8The ex-ante investigation report of Dujiangyan in 2019 from Dujiangyan Bureau ofAgricultural\nand RuralAffairs\n10","output":"{'project_name': 'Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation in Dujiangyan City', 'project_summary': 'The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice\\r\\ncultivation is conducted in Dujiangyan City within Chengdu City, Sichuan Province of China,\\r\\nwith a total acreage of 12,532 ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of\\r\\nthis project, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice\\r\\nwas cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic\\r\\nmatter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4)\\r\\nbecause of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to\\r\\nwater conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the\\r\\ncontinuously flooded.\\r\\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which\\r\\nresults in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity\\r\\nby replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which\\r\\nshortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter.

The first crediting period is from 16\/12\/2010 to\n15\/12\/2020 (10 years, renewable). The project operated normally in the first crediting period.\nThe project is applying for the crediting period renewal and the second crediting period is\nexpected from 16\/12\/2020 to 15\/12\/2030 (10 years).\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThe project falls in the sectoral scope 1: energy industries (renewable-\/non-renewable\nsources).\nProject type: Renewable (wind) power project\nThe project is not a grouped project.\n1.3 Project Eligibility\nThe project is a wind power project, which reduces CO by replacing electricity from fossil fuel 2\npower plants.

The primary purpose of the project is to generate electricity to the Lao Power\nGrid.\nTotal installed capacity of the project is 15MW, provided by two (2) bulb turbine and the unit\ncapacity is 7.5MW. Project is commissioned on 01\/02\/2021 with an average annual output of\n79,740 MWh.\nThe project is expected to constantly contribute clean energy to the Lao Power Grid. It not only\nconforms to the present situation, but also can adapt to future changes in the electricity market.\nThe baseline scenario of the project is continuation of the present situation, i.e electricity\nsupplied from the power grid. By displacing part of the power generated by thermal power plants,\nthe project is therefore expected to reduce CO emissions by an estimation of 44,192 tCO e per 2 2\nyear during the first crediting period.\nThe project is not only supplying renewable electricity to grid, but also producing positive\nenvironmental and economic benefits and also, promotes the local sustainable development in\nthe following aspects:\n\u2022 During the construction period, plenty of job opportunities were provided to local residents,\n\u2022 The infrastructure has been greatly improved. The enhancement of the transportation and\nelectricity system brings substantial benefits to local villagers;\n\u2022 The use of fossil fuel will be reduced because of displacement by grid electricity, this reduces\nthe fossil fuel-based electricity generation;\n\u2022 Provide clean & cheap electricity in this region, promote the sustainable development in this\nregion and slowing down the increasing trend of GHG emissions.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nSectoral Scope : 01- Energy Industries (Renewable\/non-renewable sources)\nProject Type : Renewable Energy Project\nThe project is not AFOLU project and is not a grouped project.\n1.3 Project Eligibility\n4","output":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}
