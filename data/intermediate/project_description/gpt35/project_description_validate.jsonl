The project is being developed with the blessings of the Institut Congolais Pour\nla Conservation de la Nature (Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation, ICCN), which is the government\npartner responsible for the upkeep and conservation of the National parks and reserves in the country. The\nother major stakeholders are the local communities of Kinlau and Malela. The two communities live around\nthe protected mangrove area (PMM), a resource they depend on for various ecosystem goods and services.\nMangrove forests are biodiversity hotspots that offer key ecosystem functioning roles including coastal\nprotection, climate change adaptation, climate mitigation, biodiversity support and provision of forest\nproducts for the local communities13. Critical among the forest services and products drawn from the forest\nby the local communities, living adjacent to the forest, include wood for construction, firewood, fish, and\nhoney. Additionally, mangroves sequester up to five times the amounts of carbon from the atmosphere\ncompared to tropical upland forest, making it one of the most carbon-rich ecosystems of the world.14 Thus,\nmaking carbon storage by the mangroves crucial in counterbalancing anthropogenic CO2 emissions and\nmitigating climate change.\nDespite its uniqueness and diverse uses, degradation of mangrove forests continues to compromise the\nstatus of mangrove forests globally. In DRC, the country records indicate that, about 1161 hectares of\nmangrove forest cover has been lost in the last ten years; a statistic that translates to an annual loss of\n116ha\/year.15 The threats facing these mangroves include encroachment leading to the conversion of forest\nland to settlement and other land uses, especially agriculture and settlement. The change in land use is\nlinked to population increase over the years, a condition that has prompted unsustainable harvesting of\nmangrove forests for construction wood and firewood for domestic use. The resulting consequences of the\nDR Congo mangrove deforestation and degradation threaten the livelihood of the local coastal people as\nthey get exposed to coastal flooding along with its devastating environmental repercussions. Additionally,\nthe loss of mangroves leads to carbon stored by the ecosystem being emitted back into the atmosphere\ncausing accelerated climate changes.\nThe DR Congo mangrove project is located at the mouth of River Congo in the Province Bas-Congo, in\nMuanda territory where about 23,683 hectares of mangrove occur (05\u00b045\u2019-06\u00b005\u2019S, 12\u00b045\u2019-13\u00b000\u2019E map).\nMost of the mangroves fall within a park, (Parc Marin des Mangroves, established in 1996) [1] and also\nenjoy the status of the Ramsar site, but continue to be degraded.[2] Management of the Protected Areas\nfalls to the Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature (the Congolese Institute for the Conservation\nof Nature, ICCN) following the order of law number 75\u2013023 of July 22, 1975. There is currently low visitation\nto the Parc Marin des Mangroves (English; Mangroves Marine Park, or Muanda Marine Reserve) thus\ncausing ICCN to shift its enforcement focus to more active parks. For any finances to manage park, ICCN\nrelies on technical and financial aid from its non-governmental organizations and international partners.\n13 Food and Agricultural Organization (2023).

Payments for ecosystem\nservices (PES) schemes, such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation plus\nconservation, sustainable forest management and the increase in forest carbon stocks (or REDD+) is one\napproach being championed as market-based option for forest conservation and management.\nThis project is therefore designed to implement activities that reduce human activities in the mangrove\nforest including clearance of the land for tree harvesting for non-commercial purposes, settlements, crop\nproduction (agriculturalist) or ranching or aquaculture and unplanned deforestation firewood or fuelwood,\nthus allowing for conservation and maintenance of the forest cover as well as restoring the degraded area\nof the forest.

The threats facing these mangroves include the encroachment of the areas by the nearby communities leading to conversion of forest land to settlement and other land uses that is linked to population increase over the years, coupled with unsustainable harvesting for wood and firewood for varied purposes. Additionally, the loss of mangroves leads to the release o f the carbon stored by the ecosystem back into the atmosphere, thereby accelerating climate change.

Combining sustainable development with carbon sequestration, TIST already supports the\nreforestation and biodiversity efforts of over 100,000 subsistence farmers. Carbon credit sales generate\nparticipant income and provide project funding to address agricultural, HIV\/AIDS, nutritional and fuel\nchallenges. The maturing trees and Conservation Farming will provide additional sustainable benefits that\nfar exceed the carbon payments.\nTIST provides an administrative backbone that supplies training in building nurseries, tree planting,\nConservation Farming, building fuel-efficient stoves and malaria and HIV\/AIDS prevention. Part of the\nbackbone is a two-way communications network that includes newsletters, weekly meetings at the Small\nGroup level, monthly meetings where groups of Small Groups receive training, periodic seminars at the\nnational level and an award-winning monitoring system based on hand-held computers and GPS. TIST is\navailable to everyone and all are considered equal. The rotating leadership and the Small Group rules\nempower women and the undereducated. Planting trees on privately owned farms in conjunction with\nagricultural activities is minimally disruptive, resulting in virtually no leakage or baseline emissions. Prior\nto project implementation, the project areas were being used as grassland or cropland.\nThe program\u2019s climate objectives include but are not limited to an increase in hectares and count of\nindigenous trees, total trees planted, and hectares of planting on hillsides and riparian areas.\nThe program\u2019s community objectives include but are not limited to the incorporation of Small Group\nparticipants within PD; an increase in number of Small Groups within PD, number of TIST participants\nwithin PD, participation in TIST Uganda, number of person-training sessions on natural resource\nmanagement practices, health, HIV, tree planting, biodiversity, vocational skills, and ICT. As well as an\nincrease in number of community members with greenhouse gas agreements with TIST payments to\ncommunity for ecosystem services, number of live trees planted by TIST Small Groups, number of fruit or\nnut trees in TIST Uganda, number of people employed by TIST or under contract to deliver services,\neconomic benefits for farmers, number of people accessing mobile money services, number of people\ngaining access to healthcare, hectares of riparian and hillside planting. The program will further seek to\nmonitor eucalyptus trees and ensure equal participation of women in leadership positions.\nProject areas can largely be found in southwest and northern Uganda (See Figure 2.1.5 A). They are\nfound in rural areas of districts including Amuru, Bushenyi, Gulu, Kabale, Kanungu, Kayunga,\nKiryandongo, Kyenjojo, Omoro, Rukungiri, and Soroti.

During rice cultivation, controllable irrigation and drainage according to rice growth requirements can not only save water resources, but also reduce methane emission from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions (in the flooded state).

The restoration efforts will take place around the Douala municipality. The project includes the plantation of mostly three species of native mangrove species: Rhizophora racemosa, Rhizophora mangle and Avicennia germinans.Currently, the mangroves in the Cameroon estuary are severely degraded, with deforestation rates estimated to be between 1% to 1.6% per annum. Human activities, such as cutting mangroves for artisanal methods of smoking fish, for cooking and for construction are the main drivers of deforestation. As such, it is estimated that the annual consumption of wood by households in communities bordering mangroves in the Douala-Ed\u00e9a area is reaching 125.60 m3. Furthermore, invasive species such as Nypa fruticans and Pandanus candelabrum have invaded many mangrove areas, which severely compromises the natural regeneration of indigenous mangrove stands.The mangrove restoration project is developed by the French NGO Plan\u00e8te Urgence, in collaboration with local NGOs. The project activities involve the establishment and management of nurseries and the plantation of mangrove trees, or regeneration when it is possible. All sites will be geolocated using GPS services. These activities will involve the participation of local communities, especially in the propagule collection, nursery management, and planting, under the supervision of the project's technical implementation team. In addition, the project will also support the development of community forests managed by local communities and the creation of partnerships with local governments to ensure the long-term sustainable management of mangrove ecosystems.

The area is near mid-size cities (Portel) and is made\nup of disturbed terra-firme (non-flooded) with only small areas in v\u00e1rzea (seasonally flooded)\nforests. Although the area is far removed (80+ km north) from the Trans-Amazonian Highway\n(Rodovia Transamaz\u00f4nica, BR-230), river and sea access has facilitated extraction of most\nprecious woods, and most forest areas are heavily intervened; settlement by ribeirinhos (river-\nmargin dwellers) is also spreading westward from the Atlantic. There are also a few logging\nconcessions authorized by the Brazilian government operating in the area. Mining operations do\nnot seem to be a problem in the territories.\nMost riverside people (comunidades ribeirinhas extrativistas) subsist by a mix of fishing, hunting,\nand especially by harvesting a\u00e7a\u00ed palm fruits and by cultivating cassava from which flour is made,\nas the latter two are the main staple foods of the people in the state of Par\u00e1. Agriculture is practiced\nin small-scale slash-and-burn plots for the cassava; the a\u00e7a\u00ed palms, which thrive and naturally occur\nin seasonal floodplain areas near the river (v\u00e1rzea forest), are harvested from the wild and\nfostered\/planted near settlements and homesteads.\nThe Marajo REDD+ Project has a significant amount of forest and is home to several ecologically\nimportant flora and fauna in a strategic region of the Amazon where there is high deforestation risk\ncaused by illegal logging and expanding slash-and-burn agriculture. The project has implemented\nvia REDDA Projetos Ambientais Sociedade Unipesoal Ltda. (REDDA) a number of activities that\nseek to reduce forest degradation and deforestation in the project area. These activities include:\n\u2022 Patrolling.\nMembers of the local communities (comunidades ribeirinhas extrativistas) are being\nemployed by the project to perform regular patrol through the project area, with a focus on\nhigh-risk degradation\/deforestation areas. The patrol units cooperate with the local\nauthorities to prevent illegal encroachment in the project area. This activity deters the main\ndrivers of Avoided Unplanned Deforestation and Degradation (AUDD) such as illegal\ntimber extraction and slash-and-burn agriculture.\n\u2022 Alternative Sources of Income.\nIn order to reduce forest degradation, it is important that the riverside communities can\nreduce their dependency on unsustainable harvesting of forest resources. To achieve this,\nthe Marajo REDD+ project is already implementing and will continue to implement a\nnumber of activities that will provide the community members with alternative sources of\nincome. These activities include but are not limited to:\no Access to training and education:\nMany people within these communities have little to no access to proper schooling.\nThe project will build several schools throughout the project area, which will allow\nchildren to receive an education and increase their opportunities in the job market.\nThis as well as other training offers will also create a framework for learning about\nsustainable practices and forest conservation.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 8\n\n[[None, 'Brazilian-Amazonian oil-chemical company active in the segment'], ['of cold extraction of oils from Amazonian oilseeds.

An example of this is the creation of eco-jewellery, which in turn can\nbe sold to generate additional income. The project has facilitated workshops,\nmainly aimed at women, to increase their proficiency in these skills and in doing\nso broaden their opportunities of income generation.\no Strategic partnerships with local sustainable companies:\nIn cooperation with the local communities, the project has established partnerships\nto promote the sustainable use of non-timber forest products. These partnerships\nencourage income generation of hundreds of riverside families. Specifically, the\nfollowing two partnerships have been established up until now:\n(i) Amazon Forest People\nThe Marajo REDD+ Project has partnered with Amazon Forest People, a local\ncosmetics company. Under this partnership, oilseeds will be extracted by\nparticipating communities and sold to AFM to be used in their cosmetic products.\n(ii) Amazon Oil\nAdditionally, the Marajo REDD+ Project has established a partnership with\nAmazon segment\nof in\nthe\nBoth be\nresponsible\nsubsequently under\nthese More\nopportunities for future partnerships are being explored in cooperation with the\ncommunities.\n\u2022 Installation of biodigesters in local communities.\nTo meet the communities\u2019 thermal energy needs, mostly for the preparation of food, the\nuse of fuelwood and charcoal is still commonplace for the riverside communities. The\nextraction of fuelwood from the forest contributes to forest degradation. To mitigate this\ndriver of degradation, the project is deploying biodigesters in the riverside communities,\nallowing them to convert their organic waste into biogas. In addition to a reduction in\nfuelwood collection, this also creates a net health benefit: the combustion of fuelwood,\nespecially in enclosed spaces, can lead to a variety of respiratory and cardiovascular\ndiseases, besides combustion of (bio)gas creates much less pollution.\n\u2022 Installation of water filtration systems in local communities.\nBesides the preparation of food, fuelwood is often used to boil water, making it safe for\nconsumption. Water filtration systems have been installed in strategic places within the\nproject area. This will provide people with free access to clean water and further reduce\ndependence on fuelwood.\nThe main driver of deforestation within the project area is slash-and-burn agriculture. Subsistence-\nbased farming is expected to remain to some extent throughout the crediting period.\nBesides the activities described above, a number of activities have been implemented to improve\nthe health and well-being within the communities, such as periodical medical examinations, access\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 9\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nto dental care and other medical care as well as workshops on oral hygiene, and general hygiene\nand sanitation, especially for women.\nThe project estimates emission reductions of 266,034 tCO2e per annum and 10,641,360 tCO2e\nduring the project\u2019s lifetime for the REDD+ component.

It spreads through three neighboring\nmunicipalities, occupying part of the territory of each. They are: Carauari, Juta\u00ed and Juru\u00e1,\nin the East of the Amazonian Region.\nThe region suffers from a scarcity of built infrastructure, notably with a sparse road network.\nHowever, the Amazonas River basin offers a vital transportation system where riverboats\nserve as the primary routes for both people and goods, including within the project's\nlocation. The area of focus is referred to as Gleba Santa Rosa do Tenqu\u00ea.\nThe property of BR ARBO has approximately 900,000 hectares of land, but in the northwest\npart, in the municipality of Juta\u00ed-AM, there is an overlap with an indigenous land that has\nnot yet been demarcated. Therefore, the owner opted for a delimitation of the project,\nexcluding this area of approximately 200,000 hectares, resulting in the property being\ndelimited to 679,355 hectares.\nCarauari is the closest town to support the property, as it is located practically on its border,\nat the margin of the Jurua River (Figure 3).\n29\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\nFigure 3- Location of the project area in relation to the nearest city.\nTo reach Carauari from the state capital Manaus: the distance from Manaus to Carauari is\n780km in straight line and 1,676km by boat, using the river system of the Amazon region.\nBy riverboat, the trip takes some 5 to 6 days, while by airplane it takes a few hours. However,\nthe airport at Carauari is served only by small regional carriers offering regular flights only\non some days of the week.\nTo reach the project area from the Carauari city: Carauari is very next to the project area,\nso its limits can be reached easily. However, accessing the interior of the property proves\nchallenging due to the significant distances involved and the lack of existing infrastructure.\nDistances can easily reach the order of tenths, if not hundreds of kilometers. The area has\nits forest cover fully preserved, so there are no permanent roads, except for some\noccasionally open paths. Displacement is mainly done by walking across the forest. It is\nslow, even impossible during the rainy season. It is also possible to travel by riverboat\nstarting from the Jurua River, where Carauari is located, using that river plus other local\nsmaller water bodies. However, here one can travel only to reach destinations on the\nmargins. From these, access to the interior is on foot again. By air, except for a mere overfly,\naccess is hardly feasible, as there are no landing spots in the area.\nThe proposed project aims to address deforestation through two distinct areas. The\nAvoiding Planned Deforestation area encompasses approximately 130,000 hectares.\n30\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\nAdditionally, the Avoiding Unplanned Deforestation area covers a vast expanse of\napproximately 543,720 hectares (Property\u2019s Legal Reserve), which will be further divided\ninto new instances to be added in the future. The geographic coordinates of the project\narea are attached in KML format (GIS database).\nAs we can see in Figure 4, in the last twenty years, deforestation is getting closer to the\nproject area. A report by Imazon2 and data from SAD reveal that the Amazon rainforest is\nstill under threat from rampant deforestation. In just one month (January\/2023), 198 km\u00b2\nof the forest were destroyed, equivalent to almost 640 football fields lost every day. While\nthis represents a 24% reduction from the same period last year, it is still the third-highest\nlevel of deforestation recorded for January in the past 16 years. This alarming trend\nunderscores the urgent need for greater efforts to protect and preserve one of the world's\nmost vital ecosystems.\nFigure 4- Forest loss in areas surrounding the project area from 2000 to 2021."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_name': 'Mejuru\u00e1 Project', 'project_summary': 'Forest conservation at the BRArbo property, located in the municipalities of Juru\u00e1, Juta\u00ed and Carauari, State of Amazonas.

Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\\r\\nThe project activity includes cement ditch construction, reservoir construction and necessary training for the farmers to help them conduct the intermittent flooded water regime during rice cultivation, which replaces the traditional continuously flooded method. Controllable irrigation and drainage according to the needs of rice growth can not only save water resources, but also reduce methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions (flooded state) In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%1.
