The presence of\nmobile (closed) gates controlled by man, make it possible to control the quality of the water introduced,\nexcluding from the circuit (closed gates) external lagoon water with low oxygen content and rich in\nmetabolites\/catabolites. Further actions are the continuous maintenance with the deepening of the inlet\nchannels that form the basis for proper environmental vivification. In addition, the natural presence of\nnutrients (iron and nitrogenous substances) in the seabed favours the development of macro-algae that\ncapture carbon (CO2) from the atmosphere during the photosynthetic phase, organise it and transport it\nto the seabed after their death during the cold season as described by Doimi M. (2021) : Human\nControlled Wetland Project for Carbon Capture and Storage in the Venetian Lagoon, Italy - Journal of\nEnvironmental Science and Engineering A - Volume 10, Number 1. In addition, the proper management\nof both tree and non-tree vegetation and soil in the emerged part will optimise the project.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThe project consists of assessing the production\/absorption of greenhouse gas CO2 in a eutrophic lagoon\nenvironment used for fishing purposes (Fishing Valley).

{"input":"Question: What is the project summary, province, country, latitude, and longitude of this project?\n\nContext: \n\nVCS Project Description - PICA\neffective planted area corresponds to 2,252.23 hectares which is given by planting density of natural rubber plantations. This\narea excludes other vegetated areas within project boundary such as creeks, borders\u2019 vegetation, and small spots of vegetation.\nThe H. brasiliensis plantations owned by the project participants are changing the socio-economic conditions of the region by\nimproving employment rates and incomes. Currently PICA, the project proponent, is seeking a financial solution that will allow\nnot only the expansion of its own plantations as well as the plantations of the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) but also to\nallow doing good practices of responsible management within rubber plantations, that provide rubber to PICA\u2019s industrial\nplant, thereby increasing the amount of raw material available for processing.\nThe project aims to create a model of sustainable competitiveness in the natural rubber sector in Guatemala introducing\nseveral innovative practices. The first will be to create a sustainable mechanism for project finance, introducing carbon finance\nas a new and key financial tool to reach the required rate of return for investors in rubber plantations. The second innovation\nwill be to create a comprehensive tool-kit of methods and knowledge related to carbon project development, monitoring, and\nmanagement for new rubber tree plantations. The third innovation represents a milestone in sustainable management of\nrubber tree plantations in Latin America, as the plantations established by the project will be certified under the Forest\nStewardship Council (FSC) principles and criteria.\nFSC certification for the rubber tree plantations established by the project activity ensures that the project will comply with\nstringent standards for social and environmental responsibility. In addition to generating emission reduction credits, the\nplantations will serve as a buffer area for 675 hectares of the Cerro San Gil natural rainforest reserve in Izabal Department. As\nrequired by FSC certification, new plantations added to the grouped project will not cause deforestation or degradation of\nexisting forests. Also, not only will the project create new employment opportunities for stakeholders, it will strive to protect\nworker safety and rights while maintaining a good relationship with neighbouring communities.\nPICA currently works with 350 rubber suppliers (plantation owners), most of them SMEs that are not participating in the\nproject. In accordance with PICA\u2019s strategic plan, the knowledge and experience gained through the project will be replicated\nwith additional suppliers to expand the areas of their plantations.\n1.5 Project location including geographic and physical information allowing the unique identification and delineation of\nthe specific extent of the project:\nThe project area consists of seven different farms comprising discrete areas located in two different regions of Guatemala.\nFigure 1 Project locations: North Bello Horizonte, Rio Frio, and Concepcion\na) Bello Horizonte b) Rio Frio c) Concepcion\n2\n\n[['Farm Name', 'Project\\nParticipant', '', 'No. of the Registered Legal', None, None, None, None, None, None, '', 'Coordinates', None, None, None, None, None, 'Location\\nDescription'], [None, None, None, 'Title2', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Coordinates', None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, '', 'Farm', '', '', 'Sheet', '', '', 'Book', '', '', 'NL', '', '', 'WL', '', None], ['Palmeras', 'Agropalmeras,\\nS.A.', '14559', None, None, '40', None, None, '75', None, None, \"14o26'0.8.14''\", None, None, \"91o17'26.78''\", None, None, 'Santa B\u00e1rbara and\\nR\u00edo Bravo, Km\\n124.5,\\nSuchitep\u00e9quez,\\nGuatemala'], ['Bello\\nHorizonte', 'Inversiones\\nAgr\u00edcolas Palafox,\\nS.A.', '1618', None, None, '370', None, None, '23', None, None, \"15o36'13.43''\", None, None, \"88o57'7.01''\", None, None, 'Route CA-13, Km\\n265, R\u00edo Dulce,\\nLivingston, Izabal,\\nGuatemala'], [None, None, '1572', None, None, '790', None, None, '22', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, '2350', None, None, '59', None, None, '31', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['R\u00edo Frio', 'Agropalmeras,\\nS.A.', '2541', None, None, '41', None, None, '26E', None, None, \"15o40'31.96''\", None, None, \"88o55'5.64''\", None, None, 'Route CA-13, Km\\n265, R\u00edo Dulce,\\nLivingston, Izabal,\\nGuatemala'], [None, None, '2542', None, None, '42', None, None, '26E', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, '2546', None, None, '43', None, None, '26E', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, '1601', None, None, '230', None, None, '23', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, '1532', None, None, '504', None, None, '22', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]]\n[['Location'], ['Description']]\n[['Project'], ['Participant']]\nVCS Project Description -

{"input":"Question: What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?\n\nContext: \n\n1 PROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nThe project carried out changes from a continuously flooded regime to an intermittently flooded\nregime during rice cultivation in Chengmai County, Hainan Province, China, with a total acreage\nof 12,488 ha of double-cropping rice. Without the project, there would be no ditches, pumps,\nvalves, and reservoirs to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously\nflooded method would be continued. The original scenario for rice cultivation by the continuously\nflooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded\nconditions can emit a large amount of methane because of anaerobic decomposition, the\nintermittently flooded method is more conducive to saving water, increasing rice yield, and\nreducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.\nThe implementation activities of the project include constructing high-standard farmland, annual\ntraining, conducting the intermittently flooded method, etc. According to the needs of rice growth,\nfarmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water\nresources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic\nconditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice\npaddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in\nthe rainy season. In this case, the methane emission can be declined by an average of 48%.\nHence, with the proposed project activity, the estimated GHG reduction from rice is 4.74\ntCO e\/ha. 2\nThe project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions by 414,337 tCO e in the first seven-year 2\nperiod, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 59,191 tCO e.

{"input":"Question: What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?\n\nContext: \n\n1 PROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nThe project changing from continuously flooded to intermittently flooded conditions during rice\ncultivation is conducted Qing\u2019an County, Suihua City, Heilongjiang Province, China, with a total\nacreage of 17,513 ha of single-cropping rice. Without the project, there would be no ditches,\npumps, valves, and reservoirs to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional\ncontinuously flooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was\ncultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Due to the anaerobic\ndecomposition of organic matter in the paddy soil under flooded conditions, a large amount of\nmethane can be released, so the intermittently flooded method is more conducive to saving water,\nimproving rice yield and reducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.\nThe implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir\nconstruction, pumps and valves installation, training, etc. According to the needs of rice growth,\nfarmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water\nresources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic\nconditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice\npaddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in\nthe rainy season. In this case, the methane emission can be declined by an average of 48%.\nHence, with the proposed project activity, the estimated GHG reduction from rice is 3.23\ntCO2e\/ha.\nThe project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions by 395,430 tCO2e in the first seven-year\nperiod, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 56,490 tCO2e. The project aims to\nreduce GHG and mitigate climate changes, increase rice productivity resulting in higher living\nstandards for local farmers and provide more job opportunities.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThis project is categorized as sectoral scope 14 (AFOLU) under Verra as justified in Section 1.3,\nalthough the AMS-III.AU methodology applied is approved under sectoral scope 15 (Agriculture)\nof CDM.\nThe project is developed under VCS scope 14 \u201cAgriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)\u201d\nwith an activity category of Improved Cropland Management (ICM) under Agricultural Land\nManagement (ALM).\n\n[['Requirements', 'Evidence'], ['Eligible ALM activities are those that reduce net\\nGHG emissions on croplands and grasslands by\\nincreasing carbon stocks and woody biomass\\nand\/or decreasing CO2, N2O, and\/or CH4\\nemissions from soils.', 'This project reduces CH4 emissions on croplands\\nby replacing the continuously flooded method with\\nthe intermittently flooded method.

They will both be located on the G\u00f6ksu River flowing through Besni,\nAd\u0131yaman in Turkey\u201fs South-eastern Region.\nMurat I and Murat II belong to Murat HEPP Energy Electricity Generation and Trade Inc. (hereafter\nreferred as the \u201cproject owner\u201d). Murat I\u201fs installed capacity is 24.081 MW whereas, Murat II is 13.14 MW.\nTherefore, the project\u201fs total installed capacity is 37.221 MW.\nAs it can be seen on the generation licence of Murat Projects, There is one Project consist of two power\nplants.\nThe main purpose of the project is to generate approximately 150.39GWh\/year1 of electricity to supply the\nnational grid using a renewable resource. The project activity reduces greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions\nthat would have otherwise occurred in the absence of the project activity by avoiding electricity generation\nfrom fossil fuel sources. The average annual emission reductions of the proposed Project are estimated\nto be 97,754 tonnes of CO e (tCO e). 2 2\nThe Murat HEPP Project contributes to the region\u201fs sustainable development in particular and Turkey\u201fs\nsustainable development in general by:\n\uf0b7 increasing the use of renewable energy sources for generating electricity\n\uf0b7 meeting the need of electricity generation and supply in Turkey in a sustainable way,\n\uf0b7 decreasing the consumption of fossil fuels,\n\uf0b7 reducing emission of GHGs from the national electricity grid, thereby reducing the effects of\nglobal climate change in the medium and long term, and\n\uf0b7 114 people have been hired during the construction phase and 23 people will be employed during\nthe operation phase. The project owner is committed to prioritize local labour force in selecting\nconstruction and operating workers. As a result the employment rate and income generation in\nthe region will increase.\nIt is worth mentioning that the project has been certified to the following standards:\n\uf0b7 OHSAS 18001:2007, occupational health and safety management certificate, valid until 05-May-\n2013,\n\uf0b7 TS EN ISO 14001:2004, environmental management system certificate, valid until 05-May-2013,\nand\n\uf0b7 TS EN ISO 9001:2008, quality management system certificate, valid until 05-May-2013.\nDuring the certification process all the employees (including subcontractors) were trained on the\nrequirements established in these standards. Moreover, the project owner has organized monthly\ntrainings and inspections to maintain these certifications.\nThe project owner has also contributed in the social and economic development of the area by:\n\uf0b7 donating 20,000 Turkish Liras (approx. 13,000 USD) to aid to develop sport activities at\nAd\u0131yaman Sports Club,\n\uf0b7 constructing a 6 m wide stabilized road in \u015eambayat Town\u201fs Balka Village, which is one of the\nsettlements near the project area,\n\uf0b7 constructing a 2 m wide and 25 m minaret2 in the Balka Village\u201fs mosque, and\n1 As stated in the feasibility report.\n2 A tower that is usually built alongside all mosques.\nv3.1 3\n\n[['', 'Organization:', '', 'Murat HEPP Energy Electricity Generation and Trade Inc.

A total of 8,645 households (36,136 farmers) were involved in the project. Without the project, local villagers would not have access to intermittently flooded technology and intact facilities to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously flooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Due to the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in the paddy soil under flooded conditions, a large amount of methane can be released, so the intermittently flooded method is more conducive to water efficiency, improving rice yield and reducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.\\r\\nThe implementation activities of the project include promoting intermittently flooded technology, technical training for the farmers, facility repair and replacement, etc. According to the needs of rice growth, farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in the rainy season.\\r\\nThe project is expected to reduce GHG emissions by 414,701 tCO2e in the first seven-year period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 59,243 tCO2e.

This is a\nconservative approach since the planned activities should also avoid the risk of future planned\ndeforestation and avoid any future worsening of degradation (currently occurring at negligible levels\nfrom the perspective of GHG emissions).\nIncreased carbon sequestration from reforestation or assisted natural regeneration is not a major\nobjective of the project. Some of the forest areas where deforestation is prevented may increase in\ncarbon stock naturally due to recovery from past logging, and in theory this might be eligible for\nadditional credits, but to reduce project complexity no credits will be claimed for this during the first\nfixed baseline period.\n2.2 Description of the Project Activity (G3)\nObjectives and conceptual model\nThe objectives of the REDD project in the Core Area link directly to the over-arching management\nobjectives of the SPF. The original vision for the SPF was developed at a multi-stakeholder workshop\nin July 2006 (WCS\/FA 2006b). This consultation included representatives from all the relevant\ngovernment agencies, local government, village leaders and civil society. The agreed Vision for the\nsite was: A well-managed forest landscape that supports increasing wildlife populations and improving\nlivelihoods for the people who currently live there. At the same meeting a general conceptual model\nfor the project was developed, linking the goal to four key measurable targets, a set of direct and\nindirect threats and a set of interventions. This was then used to develop the first three year strategic\nplan, 2008-2011, the annual workplans and the draft Subdecree.\nFigure 2.1 shows the current conceptual model, based on the 2006 results, which was revised and\nupdated slightly during the design of the REDD project based on the analysis of threats set out in\nSection 4.5.\nSubdecree 143 (2009) lists nine management objectives for SPF, which map closely to the four high\nlevel Targets in the conceptual model. These are listed below in relation to the three CCBA themes -\nclimate, community and biodiversity. The activities are then discussed in more detail.\nClimate objectives\nThe SPF Subdecree contains the following two relevant objectives.\n3- To contribute to protection and conservation, to meet the goals of the National Millennium\nDevelopment Plan of the Royal Government of Cambodia, and to maintain forest cover;\n7- To maintain carbon stored in vegetation in order to reduce carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions into the 2\natmosphere;\nThe target in the revised conceptual model is: 'Maintain the variety, integrity and extent of all forest\ntypes'\nCommunity objectives\nThe SPF Subdecree contains the following four relevant objectives.\n28","output":"{'crediting_period_start': '2010-01-01', 'crediting_period_end': '2069-12-31'}"}
