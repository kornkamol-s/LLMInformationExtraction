It is assumed that the uncertainties associated with input data are available, either\nas default uncertainty values given in most recent IPCC guidelines, or as statistical estimates based on\nsampling.\nUncertainty at all times is defined at the 95% confidence interval where the estimated variance exceeds\n+\/- 15 percent from the mean. Procedures including stratification and the allocation of sufficient\nmeasurement plots will help ensure that low uncertainty results and ultimately full crediting can result.\nUncertainties arising from the measurement and monitoring of carbon pools and greenhouse gases\nshall always be quantified. Errors in each pool shall be weighted by the size of the pool so that projects\nmay reasonably target a lower precision level in pools that only form a small proportion of the total\nstock.\nFor both the baseline and the with-project case the total uncertainty is equal to the square root of the\nsum of the squares of each component uncertainty and is calculated at the time of reporting through\npropagating the error in the baseline stocks and the error in the project stocks.\nTherefore, total uncertainty for LtPF project is calculated as:\n(29)\nWhere:\nU total uncertainty for LtPF Project, dimensionless; total|LtPF\nU total uncertainty for the improved forest management activities in |PRJ\nthe project scenario, dimensionless; and\n58\nV 4.0","output":"{2047: 80056.0, 2046: 78382.0, 2045: 26464.0, 2044: 26464.0, 2043: 26464.0, 2042: 26464.0, 2041: 26464.0, 2040: 26464.0, 2039: 26464.0, 2038: 26464.0, 2037: 26464.0, 2036: 26464.0, 2035: 26464.0, 2034: 26464.0, 2033: 26464.0, 2032: 26464.0, 2031: 26464.0, 2030: 26464.0, 2029: 26464.0, 2028: 26464.0, 2027: 26464.0, 2026: 26464.0, 2025: 26464.0, 2024: 26464.0, 2023: 26464.0, 2022: 26464.0, 2021: 26464.0, 2020: 147239.0, 2019: 142040.0, 2018: 136480.0}"}
