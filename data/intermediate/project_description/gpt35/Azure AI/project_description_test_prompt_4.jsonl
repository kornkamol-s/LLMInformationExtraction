The contribution of this project activity in terms of following four indicators\nof sustainable development as stipulated by the National CDM Authority (NCDMA) of India is\nprovided below:\nSocial wellbeing:\nSince, the project activity is in a rural area, it will aid in the development of the region by\ngenerating direct and indirect employment opportunities for the local people. The project activity\nwill also cause development of infrastructure like roads which will benefit the population in the\nnearby areas.\nEconomical wellbeing:\nThe project has created a business opportunity for local stakeholders such as suppliers,\nmanufacturers, contractors etc. Use of wind as a source of energy reduces the dependence on\nimported fossil fuels like coal and associated price variation thereby leading to increased energy\nsecurity. It will also narrow the existing electricity supply gap in the State of Maharashtra as well\nas India.\nEnvironmental wellbeing:\nSince, the project uses renewable source for power generation; it does not lead to any\ngreenhouse gas emission. Avoidance of fossil fuel consumption results in reduction of Sulpher\noxides (SOx), Oxides of nitrates (NOx) and particulate matter emission thus avoiding air pollution.\nThe project activity is a step towards environmental sustainability by preventing exploitation and\ndepletion of a natural, finite and non-renewable resource (fossil fuels). Consumption of large\nquantities of water that is required in generation of electricity in current mix of power plants is\navoided.\nTechnological wellbeing:\nThe technology leads to utilization of environmentally safe and sound technologies in power\nsector. The project harnesses wind power potential in the region and encourages setting up such\nprojects in near future. Increased interest in wind energy projects will encourage Research &\nDevelopment efforts by technology providers to develop more efficient and better equipment in\nfuture.\nSustainable Development Contributions Activity Monitoring\nThe project activity contributes towards sustainable development but PP does not monitor the\nsustainable development contributions.

As per the table above, the earliest commissioning\ndate is for the wind mill no. WEG No. 2148 which is 03\/02\/2007.\nTherefore the start date for this bundled project is 03\/02\/2007.\nCrediting period start date: 03\/02\/2007\nThe earliest crediting period start date under VCS 2007 is 28th march 2006, as per\nsection 5.2.1 of VCS 2007. The Crediting period start date for this bundled project is\n03\/02\/2007.\nThe duration of the crediting period is 10 years.\n1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:\nIn the absence of the project activity, an equivalent quantum of electricity would have\nbeen generated by the fossil-fuel dominated Southern Regional Electricity Grid of\nIndia4 generation mix. The same would in turn result in GHG emissions at the grid\nend as per the carbon intensity of the above mentioned grid. This scenario has been\nidentified as the baseline scenario for the project activity under consideration (please\nrefer to section 2.4 of the VCS PD for further details).\n1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG emission reductions\nand\/or removal enhancements:\nThe project activity under consideration entails electricity generation through wind-\nmills by harnessing wind power potential, a natural and renewable source of energy.\nThe project is expected to generate and export of 16.14 million kWh (approx) per\nyear to the Southern Regional Grid of India. In the absence of the project activity, an\nequivalent quantity of electricity would have been generated by the Southern Grid by\na majority of fossil-fuel fired power plants. The same would have resulted in GHG\nemissions as per the carbon intensity of the grid-mix.\nAs per the combined margin carbon intensity of the 0.928 tCO \/MWh for the 2\nSouthern Grid, the bundled project activity would there by result in total CO emission 2\nreduction of 1,49,800 tonnes over the crediting period of 10 years. For detailed\ncalculation procedure and sample calculation tables of the GHG emission reduction\nquantum from the project activity, please refer to Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of the\nVCS PD.\n1.9 Project technologies, products, services and the expected level of activity:\nIn wind energy generation, kinetic energy of wind blowing at high speeds is\nconverted into mechanical energy while passing through the wind-turbine. The\nrotation of the turbine blades results in the rotation of the generator mounted on the\nsame shaft, thus generating electricity. As there are no GHG emissions associated\nwith wind electricity generation, the technology is widely recognized as clean\n4 The Indian power grid system (or the National Grid) is divided into two regional grids namely NEWNE Regional Grid\nand Southern Region Grid. These regional grids have independent state Load Dispatch Centres (LDCs) that manage\nflow of power in their jurisdiction. Power generated by state owned generation units and private owned generation\nunits is consumed by the respective states. Power generated by central sector plants is shared by all states forming\npart of the grid in a fixed proportion.\n6","output":"{'crediting_period_start': '2007-02-03', 'crediting_period_end': '2017-02-02'}"}

Accordingly, the forest has been recognized and\nregistered as one of the National Forest Priority areas. Following this, in 1993 the boundary of\nthe forest area was demarcated by the Forest Inventory and Management Planning Division of\nForest and Wildlife Conservation and Development Department. For conservation and use\npurposes, a management plan was prepared in 1997 by the initiative of the Tigray Regional State\nBureau of Agriculture and Rural Development (TBoARD).\nThe project proponent, WeForest and the Tigray State Government, through the Tigray Regional\nState Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Development (TBoARD), have signed a MoU to develop this\nARR VCS project on these lands: \u201cMemorandum of Understanding Between Tigray Regional State\nBureau of Agriculture and Rural Development and WeForest Ethiopia\u201d.\nThe endorsement\/agreement from the federal government\/EECC is currently under negotiation.\nSource: Desa\u2019a State Forest Management Plan \u2013 The Great Rift Valley Dry Afromontane Forest.\nMekelle, Tigray, April 2018 (WeForest -GIZ report 2018).\n1.9 Project Start Date\nProject start date was 1st January 2018.

Two types of activity shifting are considered in\nthe methodology: cropland cultivation and grazing.\nIn the case of the Desa\u2019a project area, activity shifting of cropland cultivation is not applicable. In the\nbaseline scenario there is no cultivation of cropland taking place inside the project area.\nIn Desa\u2019a, 82% of households use the forest as a source of fodder. Grazing inside the forest is historically\none of the factors that has led to the degradation and disappearance of forest in the project area. This\nwas mainly caused by browsing, trampling of seedlings, and removing olive tree branches as fodder. The\nimportance of this driver of deforestation has however diminished in the baseline scenario for a number\nof reasons.\n- The major reason is that access to grass resources in the project area is arranged through a cut\nand carry system, whereby grass is collected in the forest and brought to the cattle, based on\nthe agreements of communities for when to harvest grass.\n- Zero grazing was introduced in 2006 in Tigray. By the time of the evaluation in 2011, its\nadoption rate was still low. However, over the past couple of years there has been the\nbeginnings of an increase in zero grazing and the adoption of improved livestock, promoted by\nthe Tigray government. Free grazing in the Desa\u2019a Forest is not allowed unless there is a\nwritten permit \u2013 see forest example the Forest Proclamation1. Sometimes there are illegal\npractices in some parts of the forest, mainly in the areas along the border between Tigray and\n1 Forest Development, Conservation and Utilization Proclamation No. 1065\/2018.\n30","output":"{'crediting_period_start': '2018-01-01', 'crediting_period_end': '2067-12-31'}"}

Hebei province is land locked and borders\nInner Mongolia to the northwest, Shanxi to the southwest, Liaoning to the east and Henan to the north. The\npopulation of the province is 75.56 million. The project aims to plant native species on suitable land for\nforest with low vegetative coverage rate for GHG removal whilst contributing to local sustainable\ndevelopment goals.\n20,750 ha (311,250Mu13) of the forest was planted on suitable lands for forest with low vegetative coverage\nrate in Zhangbei county, which used to be poor sustainable ecological environment and rocky desertification.\nPrior to the project, although the project area is suitable for planting trees, it lacks proper forestry\nmanagement, resulting in lower coverage of trees. Besides, there has never been any activity affecting the\nlocal ecosystem in the project area14. By checking the afforestation plan, it was confirmed that, a small\nnumber of trees existed in some project area before the project started, but the coverage rate was extremely\nlow. So, considering the lower forest coverage, Zhangbei Forestry Bureau determined that the project area\nis suitable for afforestation after investigation, then the supplementary planting without disturbing the\nexisting trees was approved to increase the vegetative cover. All the trees were planted without disturbing\nthe existing trees in this report, and only the trees actually planted in this project were monitored. The\ncarbon credit of the original trees in the baseline scenario will not be monitored or counted in the actual net\nGHG removals by sink.\nThe project involves Zhangbei county, with a total population of nearly 370,000. All these lands for\nafforestation activities belong to the village committees. Zhangjiakou Sailin Landscaping Co., Ltd. (hereafter\nreferred to as Sailin Company) has been fully authorized by Zhangbei government, who represents all the\nvillage committees, through a signed contract to act as the project proponent to implement project\nmanagement and monitoring, and to sell VCUs generated from the project so that Sailin Company\nconsolidate the offset resources into sizeable forestry offset projects.

Project activities were implemented by the project\nproponent in Nakula Natural Area Reserve (NAR) and Kahikinui Forest Reserve (FR) in Leeward\nHaleakal\u0101 in the county and island of Maui (State of Hawai\u02bbi), and include construction, expanding and\nmaintaining fence line, controlling and removing feral livestock and non-native ungulates, planting\nnative trees and plants, and monitoring and removing invasive species. Additional planting activity was\nperformed in partnership with the Leeward Haleakal\u0101 Watershed Restoration Partnership (LHWRP)\norganization. The Nakula NAR and Kahikinui FR have been subjected to grazing by cattle, feral goats\nand hogs for over 100 years12. Over this time, subject to this grazing pressure, the forest gave way to\nnon-native savannah grassland composed almost entirely of invasive grass species. Due to a large\npopulation of feral ungulates and the steep terrain in this region, vegetation loss leading to erosion of\ntopsoil has led to further degradation and loss of carbon stocks from the project sites. By planting and\nfacilitating the natural regeneration via removal of feral ungulates, native woody species such as koa\n(Acacia koa), \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba (Metrosideros polymorpha), olopua (Nestegis sandwicensis), mamane (Sophora\nchrysophylla), and pukiawe (Styphelia tameiameiae) are being restored, creating essential habitat for\nrare native flora and fauna, and carbon is being sequestered.

Without the implementation of this\nproject, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was\ncultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter\nin rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH ) because of 4\nanaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water\nconservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously\nflooded.\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results\nin not only large amount of methane (CH ) emissions but also low rice productivity by 4\nreplacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens\nthe period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH emission 4\ncan be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an\nestimated amount of GHG emission reduction 3.50 tCO e\/ha for single-cropping rice is 2\nexpected.

Without the implementation of this project,\nwhich provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded\nmethod would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded\nmethod is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition\ncan emit a large amount of methane (CH ) because of anaerobic decomposition, the 4\nintermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase\nand methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results\nin not only large amount of methane (CH ) emissions but also low rice productivity by 4\nreplacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens\nthe period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH emission 4\ncan be declined by an average of 48%1 .
