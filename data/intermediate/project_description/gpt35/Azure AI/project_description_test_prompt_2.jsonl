{"input":"Question: What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?\n\nContext: \n\nJoint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.2\n1 PROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nAurum Sustainable Forest Inc (Aurum) is developing a forest carbon credit project to generate\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and removals by extending the rotation age of their\noperational forests. In addition to increasing the age of their forestlands, the Goldbeck Forest Carbon\nProject (Goldbeck) will be reverting stand compositions back to natural longleaf pine forests where\nappropriate. The carbon credit project will be implemented following the Verified Carbon Standard\n(VCS) VM0003 \u2013 Methodology for Improved Forest Management Through Extension of Rotation Age\n(IFM ERA).\nProject instances will be implemented in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi,\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia; of the United States. The current project instance is\napproximately 4,140 ha and is composed of non-contiguous parcels. The project has been designed as\na grouped project to allow for additional project activity instances to be added in the future. Additional\nproject activity instances implemented will be within a similar geographic area, allowing for the use of\nthe initial project baseline scenario for additionality purposes.\nAll activity instances included in the project are currently managed for timber harvest, and all forests\nwithin the project activity instances are Forest Stewardship Council\u00ae (FSC\u00ae) certified, meeting the\nVM0003 methodology requirement. Implementation of the project activity will result in the removal of\nan estimated annual average of 309,030 tCO2e and total of 9,270,890 tCO2e over the 30-year project\nperiod.\nThe project is currently under development. Monitoring results may impact the greenhouse gas\nemissions reductions results that are currently presented in this version.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nSectoral Scope 14\nImproved Forest Management (IFM)\nExtended Rotation Age (IFM ERA)\nThe Goldbeck project is a grouped project, allowing for the addition of project activity instances\nfollowing project validation.\nGoldbeck Forest Carbon Project \u2013 V1.1 1\n\nJoint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.2\n1.3 Project Eligibility\nThe Goldbeck project satisfies all Improved Forest Management (IFM) project activities involving an\nExtension of Rotation Age (ERA):\n1. Forest management in both the baseline and project scenarios involve timber harvest.\n2. All forest areas included in the project area are subject to forest management and timber\nharvest activities.\n3. All forest areas included in the project are forest management certified by the Forest\nStewardship Council by the start of the project crediting period (F&W Forestry Services Inc.\nGroup Certificate \u2013 Certificate Code: NC-FM\/COC-000216).\n4. The minimum project period is 30-years.\n5. The project area does not include managed peatland forests and will not alter the proportion of\nwetlands because of project activities.\n6. Management practices have been projected for both with and without project scenario.\n7. Fire may be used as part of forest management but fire control measures are taken to ensure\nfire does not spread outside the project area.\n8. There will be no leakage resulting from activity shifting to other lands owned or managed by the\nproject proponent outside the bounds of the project area.\n1.4 Project Design\nThe Goldbeck project is a grouped project to be composed of non-contiguous parcels in Alabama,\nFlorida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia. The\nbaseline scenario was established using the existing forest management plan and management regime\nfor the project area. The baseline scenario and additionality assessments have been completed within\na defined geographic area. The project is composed of multiple project activity instances that will be\nimplemented under the VM0003 methodology. The baseline scenario has been determined for one\ngeographic area, and the same baseline scenario and geographic area will be used for additional\nproject activity instances which may occur following project validation.\nEligibility Criteria\nInclusion of additional activity instances will satisfy the following eligibility criteria:\n1. Additional instances must satisfy the applicability conditions defined in the most recent\nversion of the VM0003 VCS Methodology for Improved Forest Management Through\nExtension of Rotation Age (IFM ERA).\n2. The project activity instance must use technologies or measures used in this document and\nmust satisfy all conditions of the selected methodology.\n3. Technologies or measures must be applied in a similar fashion as outlined in the project\ndescription document.\nGoldbeck Forest Carbon Project \u2013 V1.1 2","output":"{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}"}

Properties managed for timber can have a variety of\nmanagement activities and intensities, but predominantly forests are clearcut at age ~40 years old\nand then replanted to conifer. Outside of protected private land, most forests have been heavily cut\nand regenerated one or more times since the late 1800s. Most managed properties undergo\nadditional silvicultural activities including a pre-commercial thin, hardwood management, and fill\nplanting understocked areas, etc. The general objective is fast timber growth to reduce rotation\nages and maximize financial returns. The forest industry is large and well established throughout\nmost of Washington State and King County.\nv3.3 9","output":"{'project_name': 'King County Rural Forest Carbon Project', 'project_summary': 'The King County Rural Forest Carbon Project is a set of dispersed properties located within King County (Figure 1), in western Washington State near the city of Seattle, WA.

{"input":"Question: What is the project proponents, includind organization name, phone number and email address, city and country of the entity responsible for managing this carbon project?\n\nContext: \n\nIn response to these adverse threats to the eco-region the Oromia Regional Government has attempted to\ntake concrete actions in recent years through policy and institutional development reforms. Establishment of\nOromia Forest and Wildlife Enterprise (OFWE) is one of these concrete actions taken. However, capacity\nand resources are still major limiting factors for OFWE to achieve significant outcome in improved\nmanagement of the forests and associated natural resources in the eco-region. This BMERP is designed to\ncreate a sustainable financing mechanism to help government and local communities build capacity and fill\ncritical resource gaps to bring meaningful changes in the management of natural resources and forests in\nthe eco-region.\nThe BMERP will build itself on works under implementation in the eco-region. From 2007 - 2012, Farm\nAfrica\/ SOS Sahel Ethiopia in partnership with the Oromia Forest and Wildlife Enterprise implemented the\nBale Eco-Region Sustainable Management Programme (BERSMP), supported by the Netherlands,\nNorwegian and Irish Embassies in Ethiopia. The programme aimed to contribute to the conservation and\nsustainable development of the unique biodiversity and ecological functions of the greater Bale Mountains\nEco-region, whilst establishing and enhancing sustainable local livelihoods. The idea was to involve local\ncommunities into a central role in the sustainable management of the area, and as the natural resource\nmanagement leaders, supported by government services, across the whole Bale Massif. The Bale\nMountains Eco-Region REDD+ initiative started as part of the bigger programme to address the financial\nsustainability of the programme.\nFigure 13. Agricultural frontiers expansion into moist forest of Harenna, Bale Eco-Region\nThere has been little active or effective management of natural resources in the area. Unsustainable\nexploitation and degradation throughout the eco-region is increasingly threatening the natural resources\nthereby the livelihoods of the local people that directly dependent on them as well as the very survival of a\nunique biodiversity resources whose economic potential as a basis for tourism in particular remains\nunfulfilled. Under business as usual, the3 eco-region will be on the verge of significant degradation\nthreatening not only the unique biodiversity of the area but livelihoods of millions of community that directly\nand indirectly depend on goods and services from the eco-region. Action should be taken urgently to save\nthis globally important ecosystem.\n1.4 Project Proponent G1.1\nThe BMERP proponent is the Oromia Forest and Wildlife Enterprise (OFWE), an autonomous fully\ngovernment-owned enterprise, established with regulation number 122\/2009 issued in July 2009 by the\nOromia State Council under the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. The Oromia Forest and Wildlife\nEnterprise owns concession for all of the forests and regionally administered wildlife related conservation\narea in Oromia State. The concession area of OFWE covers a total of 367,700 Km2.\nOFWE\u2019s mission is to undertake conservation, sustainable development and utilization of the forest and\nwildlife resources in its concessions through community participation; ensure supply of forest products\nmarkets and services to domestic and international markets by enhancing forest industry; and subsequently\ncontribute to the regional and national socio-economic development endeavours.\n33\n\nThe project proponent, OFWE, is currently responsible for the management of all forests in Oromia regional\nstate of Ethiopia. The forests were given to OFWE by concession to administer and manage it. OFWE has 9\nbranch enterprises, where Bale Mountains REDD+ mountains REDD+ project fall in two of the forest\nenterprises: Arsi and Bale branches. The two branch enterprises with the OFWE headquarter support will be\nresponsible for the implementation of the BMERP.\nIn line with this they will perform the following:\n\uf0b7 developing work plans and budgets\n\uf0b7 implementation of activities such as law enforcement, community nursery establishment and\nmanagement\n\uf0b7 support community forest management groups in the implementation of participatory forest\nmanagement\n\uf0b7 closely work with legal bodies to enforce law\n\uf0b7 ensure participation of other government agencies such as the office of agriculture, energy, etc in\nthe project implementation\n\uf0b7 coordination of involvement of non-governmental organizations\nOFWE staff profile:\nOFWE has a total of3543 staffs working in the different branch offices and districts, out of which 117 staffs\nare directly related to the Bale Eco-Region. These are working in two of the branch offices in Bale and West\nArsi within which the Bale eco-region forests fall.\nBesides their professional background and skill in forest and biodiversity management the Bale REDD+\nproject has also provided series of training to build the capacity of the OFWE in REDD+ project management\nand implementation.

Without the implementation of this project,\nwhich provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded\nmethod would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded\nmethod is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition\ncan emit a large amount of methane (CH ) because of anaerobic decomposition, the 4\nintermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase\nand methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results\nin not only large amount of methane (CH ) emissions but also low rice productivity by 4\nreplacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens\nthe period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH emission 4\ncan be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an\nestimated amount of GHG emission reduction 2.92 tCO e\/ha for single-cropping rice is 2\nexpected.\nThe implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to\n413,462 tCO e in the first 7 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 2\n59,066tCO e. 2\nThis project aims to:\n- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;\n- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;\n- Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThe project is developed under VCS scope 14 \u201cAgriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use\n(AFOLU)\u201d with an activity category of Improved Cropland Management (ICM) under\nAgricultural Land Management (ALM).

Ngari is located in the southwest border of\nChina, the west of Tibet Autonomous Region and the north of Qinghai Tibet Plateau (Qiangtang\nplateau). The objective of the project is to restore the \"black soil beach14\" and degraded\ngrassland ecosystem through reseeding native grasses and grazing management, such as rest\ngrazing and grazing prohibition, increase carbon sequestration, and promote local development.\nThe project proponent is National Forestry and Grassland Administration Northwest Investigation\nand Planning Institute.\nThe project area is located in Ngari, covering Gar County, Burang County, Zanda County, Rutog\nCounty, G\u00ea'gyai County, G\u00earz\u00ea County and Coq\u00ean County. According to the Participatory Rural\nAppraisal (PRA) report. Before the implementation of the project, there were severely degradation\nand desertification of the grasslands in this area due to the impact of climate change and human\nactivities, some grassland even degenerated into \"black soil beach\", the excellent forages in the\nplant community almost disappeared, and the natural reproduction and renewal ability was very\nlow. According to the Parameters for Degradation, Desertification and Salinization of Rangeland\n(GB19377-2003) in China15, moderately degraded grassland areas refer to the total grass yield\ndecreased by 21%-50% compared with that before degradation and the total grass yield\ndecreased by more than 50% compared with that before degradation is regarded as severely\ndegraded grasslands.\nTotally, 373,467.02 ha of degraded grassland in Ngari have been managed sustainably including\nrest grazing and grazing prohibition by fence building and seeding of local high-quality forage.\nThere are three main restoration measures as followed in the project:\n(1) Rest grazing was implemented in moderately degraded grassland areas where grass yield\nwas 130-190kg\/Mu 16 which decreased by 21-50% compared with the non-degraded\ngrassland. It is required that grazing shall not be allowed within 120 days when the grass\nturns green every year (from 01-May to 31-August) through the construction of fence and\nsustainable management. Through the implementation of rest grazing, 322,770.02 ha of\ndegraded grassland were managed sustainably.\n(2) Grazing prohibition was implemented in seriously degraded grasslands where grass yield\nless than 130 Kg\/Mu which decreased by more than 50% compared with the non-degraded\ngrassland. Fence building shall be carried out in the grazing prohibition area. When the\nconstruction is completed, grazing prohibition shall be implemented for 5 years. After that,\n14 \"Black soil beach\" is an extreme type of grassland degradation caused by overgrazing, human factors, rat and\ninsect damage, climate warming and other factors.\n15GB19377-2003 is a national standard document of the people's Republic of China which issued by The Ministry of\nAgriculture and Rural Affairs to assess the level of degradation, desertification and salinization of natural grassland.\nThe original website of the standard is\nhttp:\/\/c.gb688.cn\/bzgk\/gb\/showGb?type=online&hcno=5F1960D0692A36C09136E04E6DE60B4E\n16 1ha=15 Mu\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 9\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nunder the premise of not affecting the normal growth of the improved grassland, the\ngrassland should be used reasonably and sustainably according to the local approved\nlivestock carrying capacity. For the project, totally 40,801.00 ha of degraded grassland have\nbeen managed sustainably by grazing prohibition.\n(3) Black soil beach restoration was implemented in moderately degraded grassland areas\nwhere grass yield was less than 150 Kg\/Mu and the proportion of bare patches in grassland\nexceeds 40% which decreased by 21%-50% compared with the non-degraded grassland.\nReseeding grass, scientific fertilization and irrigation are carried out to restore grassland\nvegetation greatly based on rodent and pest control on the \"black soil beach\" degraded\ngrassland in the project area. After reseeding the grass, the project area needs to be fenced\nfor 3 years to better restore grassland vegetation. Then under the premise of not affecting the\nnormal growth of the improved grassland, the grassland should be used reasonably and\nsustainably according to the local approved livestock carrying capacity. The grass seeds\nsowed were local high-quality forage such as Elymus nutans (Drooping tassel grass). In the\nproject, 9,896.00 ha of \"black soil\" degraded grassland have been reseeded grass.\nIn addition to these main restoration measures, the project also alleviates soil desertification and\nrestores grassland vegetation through grassland management measures to improve soil carbon\nstorage and local biodiversity, supplemented by daily management measures of other protection\nprojects, such as grassland fire prevention and rodent control, so as to ensure long-term\nsustainable management of the project area. The project is estimated to generate GHG emission\nremovals of 11,698,413 tCO e in 40 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 2\n292,460 tCO e. 2\nThe objectives of the project including:\nClimate: Restore the degraded grassland ecosystem, increase grassland coverage, increase\ngrassland carbon sink function and reduce GHG emissions.\nCommunity: Improve the livelihood of local herders, provide permanent and temporary job\nopportunities for them, increase their income. Provide technical skills and training in sustainable\ngrassland management. Protect the sacred mountains (Kang Rinpoche) and holy waters (Lake\nManasarovar) widely respected by the Tibetan people which is conducive to the protection and\ndevelopment of Tibet's traditional Zhangzhung culture. Zhangzhung culture is the traditional\nculture of the Tibetan people, also known as the basic culture of Tibet. The traces of ancient\nZhangzhung culture run through all aspects of Tibet. From production to life, from folk custom17 to\nbelief, there is the shadow of Zhangzhung culture everywhere. For example, religious activities\nsuch as offering sacrifices to mountain gods and turning mountains18 are all derived from the\nZhangzhung culture.\nBiodiversity: Provide more suitable habitats for wild animals and increase local biodiversity.\n17 The ancient Zhangzhung Buddha dharma occupies the supreme position in the traditional culture of ancient\nZhangzhung culture.

Without the implementation of this project, the continuously flooded method\nwould be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method\nis the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can\nemit a large amount of methane (CH ) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent 4\nflooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane\nemission reduction than the continuously flooded.\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results\nin not only large amount of methane (CH ) emissions but also low rice productivity by 4\nreplacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens\nthe period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH emission 4\ncan be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an\nestimated amount of GHG emission reduction 9.15 tCO e\/ha for double-cropping rice is 2\nexpected. Annual average estimation of GHG emission reductions from the project activity\nis 59,906 tCO e\/year, and the total GHG emission reductions are 599,060 tCO e during the 2 2\nfixed 10 years crediting period.\nThis project aims to:\n- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;\n- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;\n- Increase the number of local individuals who have relevant skills due to diversified\neducational opportunities from trainings;\n- Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\n1 Dr. Reiner Wassmann (2016).

In the absence of the project activity the PP would have\ntreated the spent wash in an anaerobic open lagoon and imported the electricity from the grid.\n1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG\nemission reductions and\/or removal enhancements:\nThe project activity involves treatment of the spent-wash in the anaerobic reactor and\ncapturing the generated biogas and also the utilization of captured biogas along with bagasse\nfor generation of steam and electricity. It is assumed that CO emissions from surplus biomass 2\ndo not lead to changes of carbon pools in the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry\n(LULUCF) sector.\nIn the absence of the project activity the Project Proponent (PP) would have treated the spent\nwash in the anaerobic open lagoon system which would have resulted in emission of methane\nenriched biogas into the atmosphere. In the absence of the project activity the PP would have\ngenerated the steam by firing bagasse\/biomass in a low pressure boiler and imported the\nelectricity from the grid. Thus, the generation of power in the project activity would result in\ndisplacement of equivalent electricity generation in the grid and its associated CO emission. 2\nHence the Project activity reduces the CH4 emissions into the atmosphere that would have\nbeen emitted from the treatment of the spent wash through open lagoon system and also\ndisplaces the equivalent amount of electricity generation from the fossil fuel based grid\nconnected power plant and its associated GHG emissions\n1.9 Project technologies, products, services and the\nexpected level of activity:\nTechnical Details:\nTurbine\n7","output":"{'crediting_period_start': '2006-04-01', 'crediting_period_end': '2016-03-31'}"}
