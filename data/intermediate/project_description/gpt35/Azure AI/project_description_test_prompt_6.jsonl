The average annual GHG emission reductions\nfrom the project activity will be 140,874 tonnes of CO e and total GHG emission reductions for 2\nthe chosen 10 year crediting period will be 1,408,740 tonnes of CO e 2 .\nDuring this monitoring period, the actual emission reductions to be achieved are 68,935 tCO e. 2\nIn this process there is no consumption of any fossil fuel and hence the project does not lead to\nany greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, electricity would be generated through sustainable means\nwithout causing any negative impact on the environment. In the Pre- project scenario the\nequivalent amount of electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity, would have otherwise\nbeen generated by the operation of grid-connected fossil fuel based power plants and by the\naddition of new generation sources.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThe project activity falls under consideration of the grouped project activity. The project activity\ninstances as part of the grouped project will have the following parameters\nSectoral Scope: 01 - Energy industries (renewable \/ non-renewable sources)\nProject Type : I - Renewable Energy Projects\nProject Category: Each project activity instances will apply only small scale solar technology.\nMethodology : AMS-I.F.: Renewable electricity generation for captive use and mini-grid ---\nVersion 3.01\n1 https:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/methodologies\/DB\/9KJWQ1G0WEG6LKHX21MLPS8BQR7242\n27\n\nJoint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.0\nThe project activity under consideration is a grouped project activity.\n1.3 Project Eligibility\nThe project activity involves installation and generation of electricity using renewable energy\nresources i.e. by using the solar energy (renewable sources) replacing electricity supply from a\nfossil-fuel dominated electricity, thus leads to reductions of anthropogenic GHG emissions from\natmosphere. Hence the project activity is eligible Sectoral scope 1 i.e. energy industries\n(renewable\/ non-renewable sources) under the scope of the VCS Program.\nThe proposed grouped project activity involves 2 types of project activity instances.\n1. Few project activity instances involved in the project activity are physically connected to grid,\nbut their primary purpose is to meet in house requirement and excess energy may be supplied\nto grid (Net metering approach). If required, project activity instance import electricity from grid.\nSince project activity meets eligibility criteria of having DOE contract before 09\/03\/2020 and\nalready submitted to VEERA in Dec 2019, all project activity instances currently considered\nduring VCS registration ( i.e 490 project activity instances) are eligible for VCS and not\ncategorised as excluded scope as per VCS Standard Version 4.0. However future grid\nconnected project activity instances will not be eligible to include under proposed grouped\nproject activity. This is as per Appendix 2 of VCS standard Version 4.0, point 2) Grouped\nprojects registered under the VCS Program shall be prohibited from adding new project activity\ninstances of the newly excluded project types on or after 1 January 2020.\n2. Few other project activity instances are used for captive\/in house consumption only and not\nconnected to grid. This is to be considered a micro-grid activity, and therefore such project\nactivity instances can be in future within the scope of the VCS Program\nAlso, project proponent would like to declare the followings (the declaration is also submitted\nto the DOE):\n\u2022 Each project activity instance is less than 15 MW and already included project activity\ninstances are located at more than 1 KM from each other. Hence there is no any\nrequirement of clustering of project activity instances for currently included project\nactivity instances\n\u2022 In future inclusion, if any, the combined capacity of the project instances located at a\ndistances less than 1 KM will not increase 15 MW. Thus small scale methodology is\napplicable for the proposed grouped project activity.\n1.4 Project Design\nThe proposed project activity is a grouped project activity.\nEligibility Criteria\nThe project is a grouped project and following are the eligibility criteria for inclusion of new project\nactivity instances into the grouped project activity:\n28","output":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}

The project\nactivity involves bundling household biogas plants located in the state of Telangana, India. The\nproposed project activity includes 10,500 digesters of capacities 2m3 which were implemented\nbetween 01st September, 2020 and 31st October, 2021.\nEach household will utilize the dung of its cows to feed the digester for the production of biogas\nfor domestic purposes. The generated biogas from the plants to be used for the purpose of\ncooking and other thermal energy needs in households. The thermal energy generated from the\nproject activity replaces the equal amount of thermal energy which otherwise would have been\nsupplied from the woody biomass (fire-wood) based stove technology. Therefore, the project\nactivity replaces firewood for equal thermal energy needs and thereby reduces harmful\ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In addition, the hygienic conditions in the rural areas will\nbe improved by an appropriate disposal of waste. Further, residue from the bio digesters is used\nas organic fertilizer and will improve soil conditions in rural areas.\nPre project Scenario:\nHousehold survey was conducted to assess the baseline fuel and quantity used. As per the\nSurvey, firewood was the main fuel used to suffice domestic energy needs (cooking). It was\nsourced from nearby forests and open market. Usage of firewood in inefficient cooking system\n(conventional system) leads to indoor pollution and land use patterns have been showing a\ndecrease in forest land cover and increase in degraded land. A trend of forests turning into open\nscrubs has been observed. Degradation of forest lands has exacerbated the already existing\nproblem of desertification. There is a need to maintain adequate forest cover in the state to\nmitigate climate change effects.\nProject Scenario:\nThe project activity involves construction and maintenance of 10,500 household biogas plants\nlocated in the state of Telangana, India of capacities 2m3. The project development is performed\n& maintained by Dhaneswri Mahila Sewa Sansthan Project activity involves installation of new\nbiogas plant in the households of Telangana and produced biogas will be used in the biogas\nstoves for thermal energy needs. Hence, the project activity is a Greenfield project activity.\nResidues from the bio digesters are used as organic fertilizer in the garden area and fields of the\nlocal people.\nProject activity will result in average saving of 51,409 tCO e\/year. 2\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThe project activity is a small scale project.\n4\n\n[['Organization name', None, None, '', 'Greneity Infocom Service Pvt Ltd', ''], ['Contact person', None, None, '', 'Ms. Shivani Garg', ''], ['', 'Title', '', '', 'Managing Director', ''], ['Address', 'Address', None, '', 'Shivani Garg', ''], [None, None, None, None, '137-B, Pocket-A, Dilshad Garden, New Delhi \u2013 110095', None], ['Telephone', None, None, '', 'Phone: +91-9886252062', ''], ['', 'Email', '', '', 'Email: Shivani.garg@greneity.com', '']]\nJoint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.1\nSectoral Scope 01: Energy industries (renewable - \/ non-renewable sources).\nProject Type : I - Renewable Energy Projects\n1.3 Project Eligibility\nProject activity involves switch from non-renewable biomass based conventional stoves to biogas-\nbased stoves for thermal applications by the rural households which is eligible under scope of\nVersion 4.3 of the VCS Standard.\n1.4 Project Design\nThe project activity is a single small scale project activity (not a group project activity).

The\nestimated annual GHG emission reductions of the project are 115,860 tCO e. 2\nFor the project:\n- The scenario existing prior to the start of the implementation of the project is that electricity\ndelivered to NEPG by the project would have otherwise been generated by the operation of\ngrid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources.\n- The project scenario is that the implementation of the project, i.e. the installation and\noperation of 16 sets of 3,000kW wind turbines with a total installed capacity of 48MW which\nwill supply an average annual electricity generation of 120,240 MWh to NEPG, replace the\nequivalent amount of electricity generation by fossil fuel fired power plants connected into\nNEPG and thus reduce the GHG emissions.\n- The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation\nof the project.\n- The project will not only supply renewable electricity to grid, but also contribute to sustainable\ndevelopment of the local community and the host country by means of:\n- Accelerating the economy development of the local area and increasing the local revenue;\n- Reducing the GHG emissions which are caused by the grid-connected fossil fuel-fired power\nplants;\n- Increasing the employment opportunities of the local area;\n- Ameliorating the energy structure of the local area.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThe Project falls in the sectoral scope 1: energy industries (renewable-\/non-renewable\nsources).\nProject type: Renewable (wind) power project\nThe Project is not a grouped project.\nv3.3 4\n\n[['', 'Organization name', '', 'Daqing Lvyuan Wind Power Co., Ltd.'], ['', 'Contact person', '', 'Guo Yongquan'], ['', 'Title', '', 'Deputy General Manager'], ['Address', 'Address', None, 'No. 115, Changjiang Road, Nangang District, Haerbin City, Heilongjiang\\nProvince, China.'], ['', 'Telephone', '', '+86-451-82282792'], ['Email', 'Email', None, 'windpowergyq@163.com (cc:huanengliyong@163.com)']]\n[['Organization name', None, None, 'Beijing Ruifang Technology Co., Ltd.'], ['Role in the project', None, None, 'Project participant'], ['Contact person', None, None, 'Teng Haipeng'], ['Title', None, None, 'Manager'], ['Address', None, None, 'Haidian District, Beijing, China'], ['Telephone', None, None, '+86 10 86291231'], ['', 'Email', '', 'Teng_hp@126.com']]\n[['', 'Project Scale', None, ''], ['Project', None, '\u221a', None], ['Large project', None, '', None]]\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n1.3 Project Proponent\n1.4 Other Entities Involved in the Project\n1.5 Project Start Date\n07\/01\/2013\uff08project started commissioning\uff09\n1.6 Project Crediting Period\nThe first 7-year renewable crediting period under CDM started on 23\/07\/2012 and expired on\n22\/07\/2019.

In 2003-04, the demand for energy was increased by 2 percent which accounts to a\nshortfall of 559 billion kWh, while peak demand rose to 84,574 MW. In the period\n1992-93 to 2003-04, the energy demand for electricity increased at a CAGR\n(compounded annual growth rate) of around 6 per cent, from 305 billion kWh to 559\nbillion kWh. During the same period, supply increased at a CAGR of around 6 per cent.\nAs a result, the energy shortage grew from 25 billion kWh (8.33 per cent) in 1992-93 to\n40 billion kWh in 2003-04 (7.15 per cent).\nAs the figure shows, India has constantly been plagued with a demand supply gap in the\nPower sector. Such a gap is a major hindrance to the growth of a developing economy\nlike India. The Government of India set up the Kohli Committee under Mr. Udesh\nKohli to estimate the investment required in the sector over the tenth and eleventh plans\nto bridge this demand-supply gap.\n2http:\/\/cii.in\/documents\/September2005-IEPU.pdf\n6","output":"{'project_name': 'Bundled Wind Power Project in Tamilnadu, India, Co-ordinated by Tamilnadu Spinning Mills Association(TASMA-II)', 'project_summary': 'The project activity is a grouped Wind power project in Tamil Nadu, India, co-ordinated by Tamil Nadu Spinning Mills Association (referred as TASMA II).

Wind parks are not included in this list and thus an EIA is not required.\n2.2 Local Stakeholder Consultation\nThe stakeholder meetings for the project were conducted at Suzlon\u2019s Regional office at Jaisalmer\n(Rajasthan) respectively on 24-March-2011 & 26-April-2011. The stakeholders were invited by Public\nNotice dated 12-March-2011 & 12-April-2011 respectively. Personal invitations were also given to the\nstake holders. The meeting were coordinated by Suzlon Energy Limited. Mr. Mohammad Abid, Mr.\nHimanshu Kulkarni, Mr. Kishanlal Jakhar, Mr. Chetan Mehra & Mr. Surender Chaudhari represented\nSuzlon in these meetings. The PP was represented by Mr. Nitin Jadhav. The stake holders were identified\nbased on the sustainability impact (direct & indirect) of this project activity on the life of the local people.\nThe project proponent & Suzlon welcomed the stakeholders for the meeting. The meeting was conducted\nin Hindi. The representatives of Suzlon & PP explained the purpose of the meeting to the present\nstakeholders and introduced all the stakeholders to all the representatives. He briefed the stakeholders\nabout the concept of Clean Development Mechanism, wind technology, climate change, effect of green\nhouse gases on human life, environmental benefits of the wind power projects etc.\nMr. Mohammad Abid explained about the power-deficit scenario in India and the need of energy. He\nexplained importance of wind mills projects with respect to environmental well-being and its effect on\nlocal economy. He informed stakeholders about project promoter\u2019s keen interest in development of this\nproposed project and its effect on sustainable development of the local area.\nSome villagers gave comments (which are discussed below) on the wind farm and its effect on their life.\nThe stakeholder meeting ended with vote of thanks by Suzlon and PP.\nSummary of the comments received:\nThe project proponent & Suzlon invited the stakeholders to offer their comments on the project.\nThe stakeholders present in the meeting gave a positive response; illustrating the different improvements\nmade in the village due to the project activity like medical facilities, availability of ambulance, oxygen\ncylinders, civil work contracts to the local people etc. They further added that, different employment\nopportunities, like security guards, drivers, have been created for local people. Jitendra Singh, a local\ndriver, said he is happy with the wind farm development in the local area as he has got job as a driver\nand that helped him to live a stable life. He then queried if more projects like these can be brought in the\narea. It was explained to the villagers that Suzlon has already commissioned many such projects in\nJaisalmer and will continue to do so. Mr. Singh also wanted to know if the electricity from these projects\n2 http:\/\/www.environmentwb.gov.in\/pdf\/EIA%20Notification,%202006.pdf\n12","output":"{'project_name': 'Grid Connected Wind Power Project by M\/s.

Detailed project instance boundaries will be archived as GIS files located in the project\ndatabase.\n1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation\n1.10.1 Historical conditions in the Lower Mississippi Valley\nBottomland hardwood forests and cypress swamps were historically the predominant forest cover types\nalong the major river floodplains in the Lower Mississippi Valley (LMV). The LMV, which occupies the\nformer floodplain of the Mississippi River from Cairo, Illinois to the mouth of the river in Louisiana,\nhistorically supported one of the largest contiguous tracts of floodplain forest in the World. Over the past\ncentury, these forests were cut and converted to agriculture on a massive scale and today only 26% of\ntheir former extent remains9, much of it as isolated fragments. Most of the original forest cover in the\nLower Mississippi Valley was removed by logging between the late 1800\u2019s and early 1900\u2019s, facilitated by\ndevelopment of the railroad and implementation of flood control measures10. Forests in the region were\ncleared again in the 1960\u2019s through the mid 1970\u2019s in response to booming soybean markets and federal\nsubsidies for clearing11,12.\nThe historic bottomland forests of the LMV were diverse, with over 60 tree species; this forest type\ncontinues to be one of the most productive in the U.S.13,14 Bottomland forests in the region also provided\nhabitat for a wealth of wildlife, including the Florida panther, Red Wolf, Louisiana Black Bear, and Ivory-\nbilled Woodpecker, species which are now rare or extirpated from the region.\nThe Lower Mississippi Valley Joint Venture Forest Resource Conservation Working Group (2007,\nreferencing Tanner15, Conner16) present an overview of the natural distribution of bottomland hardwood\ncommunities in the LMV in relation to hydrology.

{"input":"Question: What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?\n\nContext: Kitambar  Ceramic - VCS Project Description  \n 12This way, it can be concluded that non-renewable biomass has been used since 31 December 1989. \nThe cashew tree pruning is considered renewable accordi ng to option II, as soon as it fits all the assumptions \nbelow: \n\u201cThe biomass is woody biomass and originates  from croplands and\/or grasslands where: \n(a) The land area remains cropland and\/or gr asslands or is reverted to forest; and \n(b) Sustainable management pr actices are undertaken on these land areas to ensure in particular that the level of \ncarbon stocks on these land areas does not systematically  decrease over time (car bon stocks may temporarily \ndecrease due to harvesting); and \n(c) Any national or regional forestry, agriculture a nd nature conservation regulations are complied with.\u201d \nResidues from cashew trees fits  all the three options above since just re sidues from the cropla nds area ar e utilized, \ni.e. the area remains a cropland with the use of the biomass. Moreover, the areas where the cashew trees fallows \nsustainable management practi ces, according to is cultivation and harvest techniques, where the pruning of cashew \ntrees is necessary in order to allow an appropriate form ation of the tree and maintaining favorable conditions for \nthe next harvest period21. This way, in cashew cultivation must be cut undesirable branches of the cashew trees. \nBesides, Brazilian\u2019s production presents the tendency of increasing so far, carried by the new technologies utilized \nand the higher national and inte rnational demand of cashew nuts22. This way, the Brazilian sources of residues \nfrom cashew trees will increase following the Brazilian produc tion, due the fact that cashew cultivation requests it. \n \n \nThe elephant grass is considered renewa ble according to option III, as soon as  it fit all the assumptions below:   \n\u201cThe biomass is non-woody biomass and originates  from croplands and\/or grasslands where: \n(a) The land area remains cropland and\/or gr asslands or is reverted to forest; and \n(b) Sustainable management pr actices are undertaken on these land areas to ensure in particular that the level of \ncarbon stocks on these land areas does not systematically  decrease over time (car bon stocks may temporarily \ndecrease due to harvesting); and \n(c) Any national or regional forestry, agriculture a nd nature conservation regulations are complied with. \u201d \nCurrently, elephant grass has been acquiring national importa nce as biomass to generate thermal energy due to its \nhigh productiveness and easy adaptation in almost all climate and soil Brazilian conditions23. The elephant grass is \ncultivated in pasture or degraded areas, in which there is  no vegetation to be deforested. Therefore, this practice \nwill not generate competing use of biomass and it will not deforest a vegetated area. \n \nThe Algaroba wood  (Prosopis juliflora),  is considered renewable accordin g to option IV: \u201cThe biomass is a \nbiomass residue and the use of that bi omass residue in the project activity does not involve a decrease of carbon \npools, in particular dead wood, litter or soil organic carbon, on the land areas where the biomass residues are \noriginating from\u201d. \nThe utilization of Prosopis juliflora is in according with option IV since it is considered a biomass residue due its \ncompetitive characteristics. A research made by EMBRAPA24, which encompass the States of Pernambuco  and \nBahia , affirmed that Algaroba  is characterized as an invasive exotic plant due to its fast expansion, which causes \nmany environmental impacts25. This source stated that there were several centers of Algaroba  operation \nhighlighting the San Francisco  Basin, which is comprised for many  municipalities from the states of Bahia  and \nPernambuco , including this project region. \n \nThe forest residues (sawdust), suga r cane bagasse and coconut husk are agro-industries residues, so they are \nconsidered renewable according to option V of methodology definition of renewable biomass: \u201cThe biomass is the \nnon-fossil fraction of an industrial or municipal waste\u201d. As  mentioned in section 4.1, sugar cane bagasse, coconut \nhusk and forest residues are common residues in the regi on generated. Bagasse is ge nerated by industries to \nproduce alcohol. Each ton of sugar cane used for al cohol production generates around 140 Kg of sugar cane \nbagasse, which can be either compacted into briquettes or utilized in natural for thermal energy generation.26 The \nforest residues are resulted from wood manufacturing. Eventually, the coconut husk is widely generated due to the \nutilization of the coconut fruit for diverse finalities. \n \n                                                 \n21 According with \u201cManual de Aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de sistemas descentraliz ados de Gera\u00e7\u00e3o de Energia el \u00e9trica para projetos de \nEletrifica\u00e7\u00e3o rural\u201d Available at: http: \/\/www.cepel.br\/~per\/dow nload\/rer\/rt-789-00.pdf  \n22Checked at:  http:\/\/www.norde sterural.com.br\/nordesterur al\/matLerdest.asp?newsId=2219 \n23  According to EMBRAPA (Brazilian Agri cultural Research Corporation's).

E.S.P (hereafter, the project proponent).\nThe project activity consists of a small hydroelectric plant that utilizes water from the Mulatos river,\nlocated in the south-east region of the Department of Antioquia, Colombia (hereafter, the Host Country),\nin the Municipality of Tarso.\nBefore the implementation of the project activity, no power plants were installed at the project site. The\nenergy that will be generated by the project is currently dispatched by other power plants that are\nconnected to the national grid, and that include fossil fuel power plants. Hence, the baseline scenario and\nthe scenario prior to project implementation are the same and the project will help to reduce thermal\npower generation in the National Interconnected System (SIN1) by providing renewable energy to the grid.\nThe Mulatos II project is a run-of-river hydroelectric plant. The project requires the construction and\ninstallation of a lateral intake, a spillway, a gate for sediment flushing, a desander, channel,\nforebay\/settling tank, high-pressure penstock, power-house and discharge channel. One pelton turbine\nwith vertical axis and 7.0 MW and one synchronous generator with 7.8 MVA2 will be installed in the plant.\nFor this VCS project activity, the installed capacity is defined by the total installed turbine nameplate\ncapacity of 7.270 MW3.\nThe electricity generated by the project is expected to be around 42.49 GWh per year4, which will be\ndelivered to the SIN. It will help to reduce thermal power generation in the SIN by providing renewable\nenergy to the grid. Thus, it will contribute to sustainability by increasing the share of renewable energy\nand reducing GHG emissions. The expected average annual emission reductions are 18,529 tCO during 2\na renewable 10-years crediting period.\nMoreover, the project activity will facilitate the achievement of electricity demand required for the social\nand economic development of the country based on a renewable energy source. The project will\ncontribute to the region\u2019s sustainable development in the following ways:\n\uf0b7 The project will decrease emissions of sulphur oxides (SO ), nitrogen oxides (NO ), carbon x x\nmonoxide, particulate matter, other pollutants, as well as carbon dioxide associated with the\ncombustion of fossil fuels.\n\uf0b7 The project will reduce the dependence on fossil fuels, which are non-renewable and limited in\nsupply.\n\uf0b7 During construction, the project will provide employment opportunities. To the extent practical,\nthese jobs will be filled by local residents. Besides, employment will also be generated for\noperation and maintenance activities\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\n1 In Spanish: Sistema Interconectado Nacional\n2 With the capacity factor cos (\u03c6) = 0.9, the capacity is 7.0 MW.\n3 See technical specifications of equipment, section 5 of \u201cProject Design Mulatos II.pdf\u201d\n4 Third-party generation study from Proyectos de ingenieria especializada S.A., see feasibility study \"Project Design\nMulatos II.pdf\", section 7.4.1.\nv3.2 3\n\n[['', 'Organization name', '', 'Energ\u00eda del Suroeste S.A.

However, intermittent flooded water regime\nrequires that irrigation and drainage can be controlled according to the growth needs of rice\nduring its cultivation. To improve the infrastructure conditions of agricultural production,\nincrease food production, and promote sustainable agriculture, the project was implemented.\nTherefore, the project was not implemented to generate GHG emissions for the purpose of\ntheir subsequent reduction, removal, or destruction.\nSince the conditions existing prior to the project initiation is the same as baseline scenario,\nplease refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario) to see the detail information.

Without the implementation of this project, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\\r\\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%2 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 9.27 tCO2e\/ha for double-cropping rice is expected. Annual average estimation of GHG emission reductions from the project activity is 59,929 tCO2e\/year, and the total GHG emission reductions are 599,290 tCO2e during the fixed 10 years crediting period.\\r\\nThis project aims to:\\r\\n- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;\\r\\n- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;\\r\\n- Increase the number of local individuals who have relevant skills due to diversified educational opportunities from trainings;\\r\\n- Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers.', 'project_state_province': 'Guangdong Province', 'project_country': 'China', 'project_latitude': 23.14, 'project_longitude': 113.2}"}
