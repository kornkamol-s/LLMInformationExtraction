Version 16 is applicable where the project activity:\n\u2022 Comprises renewable energy technologies that supply users with thermal energy that\ndisplaces fossil fuels;\n\u2022 Total installed\/rated thermal energy generation of the project equipment is equal to or\nless than 45 MW thermal;\n\u2022 Biomass used as fuel meets requirements of CDM \u2013 Executive Board Meeting 23,\nAnnex 18: Definition of Renewable Biomass\nThe proposed project activity at MAG consists of the replacement of fossil fuel fired boilers and\nunit heaters, with a centrally located boiler house utilizing biomass boiler technology and locally\nobtained renewable biomass. This thermal energy will be used by the project operator and not\ndistributed to other users.\nThe boilers to be installed are rated at 8 MW thermal each. MAG will install a total of three\nboilers over a two-year period for a total rated thermal capacity of 24 MW.\nBiomass to be used in the project activity as fuel for the boilers has been identified and sourced\nand will meet the definition of renewable biomass as indicated in AMS-I.C Ver 16.\nBased on the above-mentioned applicability requirements, AMS-I.C. Ver 16 applies, and the use\nof this methodology for this project activity is justified.\n2.3 Identifying GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs for the baseline scenario and\nfor the project:\nMid American Growers project activity provides a switch to renewable biomass for thermal\napplication from natural gas.

Identification of alternative land use scenarios to the proposed project activity\nThe following alternatives are considered:\n1. Land use will continue to be agricultural with unsustainable practices, which will lead to the\nloss in soil nutrients and degradation\n2. Adoption of sustainable agricultural land management practices by considering incentives from\nthe carbon revenues (project activity)\nThe following are analyzed as the alternative land uses to the project activity which are in\ncompliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements in India.\n1. Land use will continue as pre-project land use- marginal cultivation, fallow, barren lands\n2. Adoption of sustainable agricultural land management practices (project activity)\nStep 2: Barrier analysis\nSub-step 2a. Identification of barriers that would prevent the implementation of at least one\nalternative land use scenarios\nThe barriers that are considered plausible for the implementation are:\nInvestment barriers, Institutional barriers, Technological barriers, Barriers related to local\ntradition; Barriers due to prevailing practice; Barriers due to local ecological conditions\nSub-step 2b: Elimination of land use scenarios that are prevented by the identified barriers\n31\n\nJoint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.1\nThe scenario 2 which is the implementation of SALM has technological, prevailing practice and\nlocal traditions which create a barrier for its voluntary adoption by the farmers. Further, access to\nfinance to implement the SALM practices also exist.\nOutcome of Sub-step 2b: The land use types that are not prevented by any barriers are as follows.\nAlternative 1: Land use will continue as pre-project land use which is unsustainable ALM\ntechniques which will lead to degradation of fertile crop land.\nSub-step 2c.

The four coastal zones where the\nproject will be mainly carried out have multiple Community Fisheries (Cfi), and within these Cfi\nboundaries include existing mangrove areas. Also, in the case of Inland areas where mangroves\ngrow have multiple Community Forestry (CF) to manage the mangrove forest. However, many Cfis\nand CFs with mangroves are expriencing a decrease in mangrove forests and most Cfis still have\ncoastal areas where further expansion of mangrove forests is possible. Also, CFs with mangroves\nhave degraded mangrove areas that need reforestation or management.\nAs the first instance of grouped project, it covers 100 ha of afforestation areas that are\nexpandable within the Cfi area of Kampot and Kep province. Both are coastal provinces located\n12\n\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.4\nin southern Cambodia with thirteen Community Fisheries; Kampot:8, Kep:5. Community\nFisheries in Kampot are Trapeang Ropov, Preak Tnaot, Changhaon, Kep Thmei, Toteung Tngai,\nTrapeang Sangkae, Kampong Samaki, Kaoh Kruesna Lork. Community Fisheries in Kep are Ou\nkrasar, Kampong tralach, Phum thmei, Kep, Angkaol.\nThe area of the afforestation for each Cfi is calculated through GIS analysis. The selection and\ncalculation of the area that meets the afforestation requirements were carried out by conducting\ninterviews with residents and getting information from Fisheries Cantonment (FiC), a local\nstakeholder. The requirements for the afforestation selection are as follows. 1) The lands or\ncoastal area where the tide flows in 2) The lands with mangroves that exist around area 3) The\nlands without investment or development plans 4) The lands where soil conditions are muddy\nnot sandy or rocky 5) The lands where the area is exposed during the low tide season to plant\nmangroves 6) The lands where natural disasters are less frequent 7) Other lands that can be\njudged as areas in need of afforestation in the experience of local residents.\nIn addition, the project area is divided into existing mangrove areas, seagrass areas, fishing\nzone areas, and private land to prevent conversion of existing land use due to afforestation. The\nmap of the Cfis and project boundaries in Kampot and Kep provinces where this project being\nimplemented can be seen in the figure 2. and figure 3. below. An afforestation plan optimized\nfor mangrove afforestation in the project boundary is prepared through soil analysis and tree\nspecies investigation for afforestation areas selected within the project boundary map below.\nThe coordinates and area of the afforestation will finally be updated according to the new\nafforestation plan within this Project Description. In addition, stratification is carried out based\non this afforestation plan to enable accurate GHG emission reduction calculations.\nFor another instances, other bare lands for afforestation and degraded mangrove areas for\nreforestation will be identified by conducting GIS analysis and on-site visit. After then, the project\ntargeted area is determined through the same process as the first instance. Therefore, the area\nto be scaled up in this grouped project will be updated to Project Description periodically.\n13\n\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.4\nFigure 2. 1ST Instance Project Location (Kampot)\nFigure 3. 1st Instance Project Location (Kep)\n.\n14\n\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.4"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_country': 'Cambodia'}"}]}

Below is a broad-level overview showing the geographic spread of\nour project sites across Botswana. Project areas are filled in with a green shade, and the\nCentral Kalahari Game Reserve (National Park, shaded white) is included just for\nreference to demonstrate the proximity of PAIs to WMAs and protected areas. Below the\nbroad-level overview are additional GIS based maps with the project areas in the Kuke\nCorner and Ghanzi-Areas accompanied by an individual breakdown of each property with\ncorner GPS coordinates and supplemental information.\n15\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\nNote: Modisa Conservation Project is farther south and was omitted in this diagram\ndue to sizing restrictions. Boundaries for this project site are included in section 3.3,\nand ecological\/ancillary conditions are described and illustrated later in this section.\nStratification of PAIs by ecological conditions\nAll PAIs are further stratified into ecozones delineated based on MAP (mean annual\nprecipitation) among other factors.\n16\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\nMAP zone delineation process\nSatellite rainfall data were utilised to spatially operationalize rainfall zones in a region\nwhere in situ precipitation measurement infrastructure is inconsistent. Integrated Multi-\nsatellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) products (version 6)\nwere used because of global coverage and temporal richness.\nFor this work\u2014focusing on 20 years of fire occurrence\u2014 IMERG GPM data were\naggregated for each month, but it is important to note that this methodology and dataset\ncould be aggregated differently (e.g., daily) if a finer or coarser temporal aggregation would\nbe applicable. Monthly values were then used to produce three bands of annual data:\nmean, median, and standard deviation to capture separate metrics of central tendency\n(mean and median) and a metric for interannual variation (std. dev). The bands for each\nyear ranging from 2000-2021 were stacked in GEE to produce a single 66-band image\ncompatible with GEE's clusterer (unsupervised classification) package. The Weka K-\nmeans algorithm was used to classify statistically similar rainfall zones across the region.\nThe algorithm includes controls for the initialization method (random, k-means++, canopy,\nfarthest first), a distance function, and a seed function. The k-means++ initialization\nmethod was used with the Euclidean distance function and the default seed value of 10.\n17\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\nThe Weka K-means clustering algorithm allows for an assigned number of classes to be\nestablished. There is no single correct number of classes for which similar precipitation\nregimes should be clustered. Instead, it is a factor of the region size and observations\nbeing conducted that determine the number of classes. In this case, a range of classes\nwas tested from 6-15 to determine the number of classes to classify. Visual analysis paired\nwith existing understandings of major ecoregions in the region (cite) was used to settle on\n7 classes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_country': 'Botswana'}"}]}

The SPA project is established by planting of trees. The\nproject includes timber harvesting in their management plan which is in keeping with VCS ARR\nguidelines.\nii) The project has not led to any conversion of native ecosystems. All the lands parcels were barren\nfor much in excess of ten years before project start date as evident in lease agreement documents\n(explained in details in Section 1.10).\niii) The length of the project crediting period has been set at thirty three years.

The project activity falls under the small scale projects. The methodology chosen for\nthe project activity and its applicability to the project activity is discussed below.\nType I: Renewable Energy Projects\nCategory D: Grid Connected Renewable Electricity Generation\nTechnology\/measure\n1. This category comprises renewable energy generation units, such as photovoltaics, hydro,\ntidal\/wave, wind, geothermal and renewable biomass, that supply electricity to and\/or\ndisplace electricity from an electricity distribution system that is or would have been supplied\nby at least one fossil fuel fired generating unit.\n2. If the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a wind\/diesel\nunit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small- scale CDM project activity applies only to the\nrenewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel2, the capacity of the entire unit\nshall not exceed the limit of 15MW.\n3. Combined heat and power (co- generation) systems are not eligible under this category.\n4. In the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy generation\nunits at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added capacity of the units added\nby the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be physically distinct3from the\nexisting units.\n5. Project activities that seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for renewable energy\ngeneration are included in this category. To qualify as a small scale project, the total output of\nthe modified or retrofitted unit shall not exceed the limit of 15 MW.\nThis project activity comes under point number 1 of the technology \/measures of AMS I-D.\nThe applicability of this methodology may be explained through the following arguments\n\u00b7 The project activity involves electricity generation using renewable energy which is\nbased on wind power and wheeling of the electricity generated to the Sree JayaJyothi\nTextile Mills Pvt Ltd through Tamil Nadu State Electricity Board (TNEB). This\nproject activity displaces the equivalent amount of electricity generation through the\noperation of existing\/proposed fossil fuel based power plants connected to the Grid.\n\u00b7 The project activity involves installation of renewable energy generation units only\n(Wind Turbine Generators)\n\u00b7 The project activity doesn\u2019t involve cogeneration system. The project activity\ninvolves electricity generation from the Wind Turbine Generators.\n\u00b7 The project activity doesn\u2019t involve addition of renewable energy generation units at\nexisting power generation facility.\n2 Co-fired system uses both fossil and renewable fuels.\n3 Physically distinct units are those that are capable of generating electricity without the operation of\nexisting\nunits, and that do not directly affect the mechanical, thermal, or electrical characteristics of the existing\nfacility. For example, the addition of a steam turbine to an existing combustion turbine to create a\ncombined\ncycle unit would not be considered \u201cphysically distinct\u201d.\n11\n\nVCS Project Description Template\n\u00b7 The project activity doesn\u2019t seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for\nrenewable energy generation.\n\u00b7 The total installed capacity of the project activity is 8.0 MW which is less than the\neligibility limit of 15 MW to qualify as a small scale project activity under Type I of\nthe small scale methodologies Also no additional WTGs will be added to the project\nactivity during its lifetime; Hence the project activity will remain under small scale\nproject activity during every year of crediting period.\nHence it can be concluded that the selected methodology, AMS I D \u2013 Grid Connected\nRenewable Electricity Generation is applicable to project activity"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

In a first\nstep, primarily project instances at bank sites are included in the grouped project.\nAll equipment is new and installed, owned, operated and maintained by Starsight Energy.\nIn the absence of the project activities, the building users would have\ni) procured electricity from a national or a regional grid (grid hereafter) and\/or a fossil fuel\nfired captive power plant, and\nii) used inefficient air conditioners that are replaced in the case of retrofit measures or would\notherwise be built in the case of a new facility, and thus used more fossil-fuel based grid\nand\/or captive power than in the project scenario.2\nThanks to the replacement of fossil-fuel based grid and captive power by renewable solar PV energy\nand the saving of fossil-fuel based electricity through more efficient air conditioners, and less CO 2\nreleased to the atmosphere. Therefore, the project activities will achieve net GHG emissions reductions.\nBecause of the renewable energy and energy efficiency activities and as per current roll-out plans in\nNigeria, annual CO2 emissions will be reduced by 50,938 tCO2 accumulating to 356,569 tCO2 at the\nend of first 7-year crediting period in 2026.3\nServing the commercial and industrial, financial, residential, educational and agricultural sectors,\nStarsight Energy delivers tailored power and cooling solutions to meet client requirements while\n1 After Starsight\u2019s intervention.\n2 Nigeria has been suffering extensive power outages during the last 15 years (cf.\nhttps:\/\/tradingeconomics.com\/nigeria\/number-of-electrical-outages-in-a-typical-month-wb-data.html).

New instances will be incorporated only if they satisfy in addition\nto the requirements under methodology VM0010 the following criteria\nWhere inclusion of a new project activity instance necessitates the addition of a new project\nproponent to the project, such instances shall be included in the grouped project within five years\nof the project activity instance start date.\nv3.0 11\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nThe risks to GHG reductions or removals are illegal logging and fire both of which would reduce\nthe amount of carbon stocks present in the property.\nFirewood collection is not deemed a risk because the population density is very low and the main\nuse of firewood is for cooking. Unsustainable fuel wood collection is not occurring within the\nproject boundaries. Thus unsustainable fuel wood collection is not a source of leakage or\nemissions for this project.\nThe quantization of GHG reductions removals will be carried out following section 3 of this project\ndescription and merits no additional information in this section.\nThe grouped project has a central GHG information system and controls associated with the\nproject and its monitoring. The central GHG infomation system and controls will require that All\ndata will be digitalized, stored at different locations and stored for at least 2 years beyond the\ncrediting period as required under section 3.18.1 of the VCS Standard v3.2. For all instances the\nfollowing tasks will be undertaken\na. The baseline scenario will be reviewed every ten years.\nb. Monitor carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions.\nc. Estimation of ex-post net carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions\nd. Monitor leakage and greenhouse gas emissions\nIn addition, all instances will be subjected to the same procedures of section 4 with regards to\n1.

Frequency\nThere are no equivalent type and level of activity of products or services provided by the project\nand the baseline scenario. On the contrary, in the baseline scenario, the project area produces\nwood products and in the project, the forest remains standing. This significant difference\nbetween the project and the baseline scenario is to be expected in this methodology, as selective\nlogging activities are incompatible with forest remaining forests.\nLeakage Management\nUnder the methodology there are only two sources of leakage: Activity shifting and Market\neffects. The first is calculated using step 5.1 of the methodology. The second is calculated using\nv3.0 12\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nstep 5.2 of the methodology. Activity shifting is monitored through identification of all parcels\nowned by the logging agent and verification through historical records and forest management\nplans.

According to the\nmethodology\u2019s section 2.2 Applicability, the methodology is applicable if the following\nconditions are met:\na) The land subject to the project activity does not fall in wetland category;\nThere are no wetlands within the project boundary [2].\nb) Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10 per cent of\narea in each of the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project\nboundary:\n(i) Land containing organic soils;\nAmongst the encountered soil series (Ultisols and Alfisols), no organic soils are present within\nthe project boundary [2].\n(ii) Land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and\nreceives inputs listed in appendices 1 and 2 to this methodology.\nThe project area is characterized as degraded pasture land and, in areas closer to population\ncenters, this is combined with subsistence farming [2].\n47\n\nJoint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.0\nThe lands of Appendix 1 refer to cropland in which soil disturbance is restricted. Farming in the\narea is characterized as small-scale subsistence farming [2], which is characterized as\ncultivation with reduced tillage and limited use of inputs. Therefore, the project area does not\nclassify as land listed in Appendix 1.\nThe lands of Appendix 2 refer to grassland in which soil disturbance is restricted. Grasslands in\nthe project area are used for extensive livestock ranching activities and without the use of\ninputs [17]. Therefore, the project area does not classify as land listed in Appendix 2.\nFurthermore, the tool Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate\nadditionality in A\/R CDM project activities is applicable, as the forestation of the land [\u2026] does\nnot lead to violation of any applicable law [\u2026] and the project does not concern a small - scale\nafforestation (<15 kton of CO2Eq annually), as shown in section 1.10.\nAs for the tool Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in\nA\/R CDM project activities, no applicability conditions exist, and the tool can therefore be\napplied.\nFor the Estimation of the increase in GHG emissions attributable to displacement of pre-project\nagricultural activities in A\/R CDM project activity, the tool is not applicable if displacement of\nagricultural activities is expected to cause, directly or indirectly, any drainage of wetlands or\npeat lands. As demonstrated above, the project does not take place in wetlands or peatlands,\nand therefore the tool is applicable.\nAs for the Tool for estimation of change in soil organic carbon stocks due to the implementation\nof A\/R CDM project activities, the requirements for applicability are that areas do not fall into\nthe wetlands category (compliance covered above), litter remains on site and is not removed in\nthe A\/R CDM project activity (true, litter is not removed on site through management practices);\nand soil disturbance [\u2026] is in accordance with appropriate soil conservation practices and\nlimited to soil disturbances for site preparation before planting and such disturbance is not\nrepeated in less than twenty years. The latter conditions are also true, as soil disturbance only\ntakes place once in twenty years with the site preparation before planting with the tree species\n[17].\nConcerning the Tool for the identification of degraded or degrading lands for consideration in\nimplementing CDM A\/R project activities, the applicability is limited to projects in the A\/R\ncategory, which is the case for the current project, as the project concerns a reforestation\nproject.\n48\n\nJoint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.0"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_methodologies': ['AR-ACM0003']}"}]}

Generations of human occupation\nand farming have made the Project Area biodiversity-poor. With TIST it has improved. We have\nplanted and maintained 411,068 indigenous trees, covering 1,653 ha and contained in 14,601\nProject Areas. These are islands of biodiversity in a degraded landscape matrix that provide\nconnectivity among the natural forests and other islands of biodiversity. There are over 19,073\ntotal Project Areas operated by farmers that are receiving ongoing training in biodiversity and\nnatural resource management. Those of these that do not have indigenous trees still provide\nforest cover. In addition, there are 305,097 fruit and nut trees covering 1,208.67 ha. These\nprovide a source of food and nectar for bees, birds, small animals living on, or around, the farms\nand larger animals when present.\nAn Environmental Impact Audit was carried out by Natural Resources Management &\nDevelopment Agency (NAREDA Consultants) in Meru and Nanyuki areas of Kenya,60 to assess\nthe environmental conditions and biodiversity of the area and to assess positive and negative\nenvironmental impacts of TIST project activities. The EIA and other assessments indicate that\nthe Project Areas themselves were not areas rich in biodiversity. However, some areas border\nMt Kenya and conserved forest, areas rich in biodiversity. By providing fuel wood from\nsustainable wood lots and improving livelihoods, the project should have a positive effect on\nbiodiversity.\nPromotion of Conservation Farming will further reduce pressure on forestland by increasing food\nproductivity by, and consequently decreasing pressure for, land clearing for agriculture.\nBiodiversity is also enhanced directly through the planting of indigenous trees, both in specific\nriparian \u2018biodiversity\u2019 groves, and through dispersed inter-planting, homestead planting and\nwoodlots. Increases in tree biodiversity should also enhance diversity of associated species,\nincluding pollinators, and other beneficial species, while protection of riparian areas will improve\nwater quality and provide other important ecosystem services.\nComparing the without-project scenario and with-project conditions, it has been demonstrated\nthat the project has a net positive impact on biodiversity."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}"}]}

Specifically, the project category is \u201cAvoided Unplanned Deforestation &\nDegradation\u201d (AUDD) for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD).\nG1.3 Guatemala is among the 19th megadiverse countries in the world, with 33.7% of forest\ncover land. Its native forest contribute significantly to the livelihood of local populations. About a\nthird of the national territory has been declared a protected area. The multicultural richness of the\ncountry, together with traditional and ancestral knowledge of the inhabitants, constitutes a\npotential for climate change projects.\nThe project zone is included in the Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) Selva Maya Corridor, which\ncontains the second most extensive tract of continuous tropical rainforest in the Americas after\nthe Amazon Forest, where Selva Lacand\u00f3na and Sierra del Lacand\u00f3n (Mexico\/Guatemala) are\none of the four keys biodiversity areas1. The Sierra del Lacand\u00f3n National Park (SLNP) is one of\nthe seven nucleuses of the Mayan Biosphere Reserve (MBR) which represents almost 20% of\nthe surface of Guatemala and about 60% of the surface inside the Guatemala System of Natural\nProtected Areas (SIGAP as per Sistema Guatemalteco de \u00c1reas Protegidas). Within the borders\nof the SLNP there are at least 29 archaeological sites from the Mayan Civilization, including the\nmonumental city of Piedras Negras2.\nThe SLNP is the second largest National Park in Guatemala. It has been characterized, along\nwith the Mirador-Rio Azul National Park, as the region of greatest plant diversity within the MBR.\nThe rugged terrain and rainfall, higher than the rest of the reserve, give it unique characteristics. It\nhas outstanding archaeological remains of the classical and pre-classical Maya civilization3.\nThe Lacand\u00f3n \u2013 Forest for Life (Bosques para la Vida) REDD+ Project (hereinafter Lacand\u00f3n\nREDD+ Project) focuses on reduce deforestation that is being exerte by different agents on the\nforest region by improving living condition of the communities located within the National Park\nand surrounding areas. Through implementation of project activities, the environmental function\nof the diverse ecosystems will be maintained, the cultural tangible heritage will be preserved and\ngreenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and degradation processes will be prevented.\n1 Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund. 2010.

CONAP awarded in 1999 the co-management of the SLNP with\nthe Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) Fundaci\u00f3n Defensores de la Naturaleza (FDN).\nThe patterns of deforestation and their associated agents and drivers in the area have been\nidentified and understood. The importants factors are the increase of human population linked to\nthe expansion of agropecuarian activities and forest fires due to slash and burn forest method,\nillegal logging, lack of public institutions presence in the field, illegal settlements and extraction of\nnatural resources (hunting and non-timber forest products as the xate palm - Chamaedorea sp).\nThe project will analyse, design and implement measures that will result in lower deforestation\nrates while includes the deforestation agents in activities that enhance the integrated\nmaintenance of the natural resources and the archeological sites. The project activities will pay\nspecial attention to the specific social and cultural issues and will incorporate these\ncharacteristics in the management plans considering at the same time, the specific biodiversity\nand climate characteristics of the region.\nG1.2 The project\u2019s community objectives takes into account the strengthening of local\ngovernance; supporting the development of sustainable economic and livelihoods alternatives\nthrough training and technical workshops; enhancing local administrative capacity, leadership\ncapacity and environmental awareness through training activities. The project activities are based\non community dialog, education and training.\nThe climate objectives will be covered through the implementation of activities to reduce\ndeforestation and forest degradation by decreasing illegal timber extraction and assuring legality\nof land use right through forest sustainable management. These activities will help reduce GHG\nemissions and will increase carbon stocks over time.\nAlthough deeper understanding of the biodiversity occurring in the project region is still needed,\nthe presence of species classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of\nNature (IUCN) has been well documented. Examples are Jaguar \u2013 Panthera onca (Near\nthreatened), Tapir \u2013 Tapirus bairdii (Endangered) and Pecari - Tayassu pecari (Vulnerable) for\nfauna; and Cedro \u2013 Cedrela odorata (Vulnerable) and Caoba \u2013 Swietenia macrophylla\n(Vulnerable) for flora. The project\u2019s biodiversity objectives focusing on preserving endangered\nspecies and their habitats as compared to baseline scenario conditions through communal\nforestry resources management, forest protection and biodiversity programs.\nGiven the high natural and cultural values present in the region, it is of utmost importance to\nidentify the environmental and economic context that surrounds the processes of deforestation\ncurrently occurring in the area. The agents and drivers of deforestation have been identified\nthrough literature review and workshops conducted with representatives of institutions.\nThe project activities will focus on identifying, prioritizing and executing actions for the adequate\nmanagement of the environmental and cultural resources and achieve their most effective and\nefficient conservation, while benefiting the sustainable development of the region.\n4 Congreso de la Rep\u00fablica. 1989.

The geodetic points\nof South Africa i.e. the grouped project boundary are shown in Table 1. A more detailed\nboundary is saved in and available in an appropriate digital Geographic Information\nSystems (GIS) format (KML 2.2 and ESRI shapefiles). The project proponent has access\nto numerous potential areas for project activity instances, including at least 19\ntownships areas at present, i.e. the availability of land for project activity instances will\nnot be a limiting factor. Whilst this land is available, communities lack the financial\nresources to plant trees.\nThe initial project activity instance will be in extension of the Delft township, situated to\nthe south and east of the principle Delft township (Figure 1). This area falls within the\nCape Metropolitan Area in the City of Cape Town. The principle township had a\npopulation of 60,667 residents in 20016. Of these, 99% had no tertiary education, 44%\nwere unemployed, 99% earned less than R6,400 per month (approximately7 USD 900\nper month) and 66% earned less than R1,600 per month (approximately USD 225 per\nmonth). The area of the Delft project activity instance is 84 ha in size and comprised of\nRDP houses (Figures 2 and 3). The area of the project activity instance is delineated by a\nbounding box (maximum North, South, East and West coordinates; Table 1). A more\nspecific boundary is saved in a GIS format (KML 2.2 and ESRI shapefiles). This\ndelineated boundary is the perimeter of the identified township within which all initial\nand future sponsored tree planting for carbon offsetting for the project activity instance\nwill occur. Within the project activity instance boundaries are specific planting sites in\nhousehold gardens. The Delft project activity instance meets the site eligibility criteria\nlisted in Section 1.168.\nAdditional project activity instances will be added to the grouped project through the\ncrediting period. This is a practice endorsed by the VCS grouped project methodology.\nThese additional instances will meet the eligibility criteria listed in Section 1.16 and will\nbe validated and formally incorporated into the grouped project during each verification\nperiod. The boundaries will be set and saved as described above. In keeping with the\nguidelines specified by the selected methodology, where instances are within 1 km of\neach other they will be managed and monitored as a single instance9, ensuring the\nproject emission reductions are within the 16,000 tonnes CO e per annum limit per 2\nproject area set by the methodology.\nTable 1: Bounding coordinates of the grouped project and initial project activity\ninstance.\nDelft 18.631929, -33.986721 18.643549, -33.976056 84\n6 City of cape Town, Census 2001, Delft.

Applications\nare received from township communities, proposals are drafted by FTFA and sponsors\nmatched to potential areas for project activity instance, the trees are purchased using\nthe sponsor\u201fs money and the tree planting process is initiated as per the Procedures\nManual. While the grouped project area is South Africa, only specific townships that have\nrequested trees will be planted as part of the project activities, using sponsorship money\nfrom the list of companies waiting to invest in carbon offsetting with FTFA. Consequently,\nalthough significantly less than 80% of the area within the grouped project boundary is\ncurrently under the control of the project proponent, it is deemed that there is more\nthan sufficient area and interest to meet the goal of planting 5 million additional trees.\nA. The additionality argument is valid for all townships in South Africa, whether or not\nthey are included as project instances (now or in the future), because no other\n10 Google Inc. 2011.

There will be no increased emissions attributable to the project activity in areas that\nare not part of the project. As detailed above, townships for project activity instances\nare selected following a programmatic approach, and FTFA has a list of many\ncommunities requesting trees and many sponsor requesting to offset their carbon\nemissions. Failure to include such sites within the grouped project area will not lead to\nincreased emissions through leakage, since there is no displacement of activities.

The project is classified in scope 14 - AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses) and\nfalls into the category Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) in the scopes of\nplanned (APD) and unplanned (AUDD) deforestation.\nThe REDD Carbonflor\u00b4s main goal is to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) through the\nconservation of native vegetation in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. The project is based on the\nconservation of the remaining forest cover of properties under pressure from deforestation and degradation.\nInformation generated by the National Institute for Space Research (\"INPE\") on monitoring forest cover in\nthe Cerrado and Amazon biomes points to increasing deforestation rates since 2012. For the Cerrado\nBiome, annual deforestation rate was of 7,905.16 km212 in 2021 (August 1st, 2020, to July 31st, 2021), a\n7,9% increase from the previous datapoint, 2020. For the Amazon biome, deforestation reached 13,235\nkm2 in 2021 (August 1st, 2020, to July 31st, 2021). This represents a 21,97% increase from the previous\ndatapoint, 2020.13\nSuch matter becomes even more relevant considering that these biomes have the highest deforestation\nrates in the country. The increases in deforestation observed in 2021 in the Cerrado and Amazon\ncorroborate the progress of deforestation activity in natural forests in Brazil, which leaves us in close point\nto reach the imbalance of the natural systems14, which affects the provisions of energy, water, and food\nsecurity in Brazil and worldwide.\nGiven the high rates of deforestation in these two biomes, the project seeks landowners who have\nproperties in the Cerrado and Amazon who choose not to deforest their properties in the legally permitted\nportions (APD), as well as guarantee the protection of permanent preservation areas (APP) and legal\nreserve (RL) of their properties (AUDD), which have also been the target of illegal deforestation and\ndegradation over the last few decades.\nIn this way, REDD Carbonflor will promote the conservation of natural forests and aims to obtain positive\nnet benefits for communities and biodiversity. Thus, in addition to reducing carbon emissions, the project\nwill promote benefits in maintaining the biodiversity of fauna and flora, providing a safe habitat for local\nfauna, increasing water retention, protecting water resources, and maintenance of the region's\nmicroclimate. Regarding the communities, the benefits will be achieved through actions of social\nengagement, education, training and capacity building, and support for local infrastructure.\nIn this context, ECCON will be responsible, as the proponent of the project, for the development of all\nstages, implementation in the different instances, and monitoring of the parameters of climate, community,\nand biodiversity of REDD Carbonflor. The other entities involved in the project are the landowners, who,\nthrough the signing of a contract and letter of intent, attest to their commitment to keeping the areas of their\nproperties conserved in the long term, which will allow for them to support the activities of the projects to\nbe developed.\n12 https:\/\/www.gov.br\/inpe\/pt-br\/assuntos\/ultimas-noticias\/nota-tecnica-prodes-cerrado-2021\n13 https:\/\/www.gov.br\/inpe\/pt-br\/assuntos\/ultimas-noticias\/divulgacao-de-dados-prodes.pdf\n14 Lovejoy and Nobre, 2019 - https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/yp6tx5eu\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 5\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nIt is important to highlight that the carbon credit revenue generated by REDD Carbonflor will contribute to\nconservation, by making the activity more attractive to rural producers supported by the project, therefore\nthe maintenance of the \u201cstanding forest\u201d will be a competitive alternative to other land uses (i.e., agricultural\nor livestock production), which are a threat to conversion of native vegetation in the current scenario.\nCarbonflor REDD activities began in 2021, with a 30-year crediting period, from October 6th, 2021, to\nOctober 5th, 2051.

The project is aimed to\nrestore the local degraded grassland ecosystem from adoption of sustainable grassland management\npractices, such as improving the rotation of grazing animals between summer and winter pastures,\nlimiting the timing and number of grazing animals on degraded pastures, and restoration of severely\ndegraded land by replanting with perennial grassesand ensuring appropriatemanagement over the long-\nterm.TheprojectproponentisOtogFrontBannerCulturalTourismGroupLtd.\nAccording to the baseline survey, before the implementation of the project, the grassland in the region\nhas been facing serious degradation and even desertification due to the impact of climate change and\nhumanactivities.\nTotally, 100,297.85 ha of degraded grassland has been managed scientifically by including by fence\nbuilding and reseeding of native grass species. There are three mainrestoration measuresas followed in\ntheproject:\nRest grazing and rotational grazing are implemented in moderate degraded area where total grass yield\ndecreased by 21%-50% compared with the non-degraded grassland as per Parameters for Degradation,\nSandificationandSalificationofRangelands(GB19377-2003).\nRotational grazing requires that the grazing time shall be reduced by dividing grasslands into seasonal\ngrazing land according to the livestock carrying capacity of the grassland by fence building. Then based\non specified grazing order, grazing cycle and zoning grazing time, the grassland is grazed area by area\nand used in turn.35,365.07 ha of degraded grassland has been managed sustainably by the\nimplementationofrotationalgrazing.\nRest grazing is also implemented in moderately degraded areas and requires that grazing shall not be\ncarried out within 90days when the grass turns green (20-March to 20-June) every year by building the\nfence, which is conducive to full greening and subsequent growth of herbage. 34,630.97ha of degraded\ngrasslandhavebeenmanagedscientificallybytheimplementationofrestgrazing.\nReseeding the grassland was implemented in seriously degraded grasslands where total grass\ndecreased by more than 50% compared with the non-degraded grassland as per GB19377-2003. Total\n30,301.81ha of degraded grassland have been reseed to restore the grassland productivity. Native grass\nspecies including Artemisia frigida, cleistogenes songorica, Agropyron mongolicum, stipa breviflora,\nPennisetum centrasiaticum and Iris bungei Maxim were for seeding based on the soil and climate\nconditions in the project area. After reseeding the grass, the project area needs to be fenced for 3 years\ntoprohibit grazing in order tobetter restoregrassland vegetation.

The project activity created\nemployment opportunities in these areas during construction phase and now also creating during\noperation and maintenance of the Wind Turbine Generators. Creation of employment opportunities in\nrural areas has long been recognized as a major concern for sustainable development and to stem the\nmass exodus from rural to urban areas. This concern has formed the cornerstone of most of\nGovernment of India\u2019s rural development programmes. To that extent, the activity directly addresses a\ncore national concern.\nEconomic well being\n\u2022 The project activity results in generation of additional employment opportunities directly and\nindirectly which helps improving the standard of living of the people in and around the project\nactivity location.\n\u2022 The project contributes to the economic sustainability around the plant site which is promotion of\ndecentralization of economic power.\n\u2022 Carbon Revenue would provide financial incentives, which encourage channelling more\ninvestment into cleaner energy projects and also result in improved returns to the project\nstakeholders.\n\u2022 It also promotes industrial growth by catering to the energy needs arising out of the supply-\ndemand gap of electricity.\nEnvironmental well being\n\u2022 The wind energy based electricity generation helps in less fossil-fuel burning in the system and\nthus less GHG emissions in the atmosphere. Use of renewable energy source (wind energy) also\nhelps in conservation of natural resources like coal and petroleum fuels.\n\u2022 As wind power projects produce no end products in the form of solid waste (ash etc.), they\naddress the problem of solid waste disposal encountered by most other sources of power. Also as\nthere is no fuel used for electricity generation, there aren\u2019t any effluents discharged into the water.\nTechnological well being\n\u2022 Wind farm \u2018marks step towards cleaner and inexhaustible source of energy\u2019\n\u2022 The project proponent has taken up an important step by introducing state-of-the-art wind energy\ntechnology"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

The most likely baseline scenario is that the area would be\nmaintained as part of the Ulu Segama Forest Reserve, without investing in the rehabilitation\nof the forest. Within a few decades there would be a second round of logging, caused by the\nneed for revenues and the fact that the number of marketable species has increased. The\ncommercial Forest Reserves in Sabah have been intensively logged in the past and high\nrevenues from large-scale logging that took place in the 1970s and 1980s have strongly\ndecreased. During the times of high revenues no forest rehabilitation took place, and with the\nreduced income from timber it is even less likely that rehabilitation is implemented. To\nmaintain a positive cash-flow from timber, operators have re-entered the commercial reserves\nfor a second round of logging. In the baseline scenario for INFAPRO, the relogging would\ntake place before the moratorium on logging in the Forest Reserve becomes effective. In the\nbaseline scenario the concept of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM), including forest\nrehabilitation, is more and more accepted and incorporated into forest management plans. The\nrate and intensity at which rehabilitation takes place is insufficient to recover the Forest\nReserve within the crediting period. The increased acceptance of SFM principles does lead to\nthe adoption of Reduced Impact Logging (RIL) techniques for relogging in the baseline.\nRegrowth of the existing trees in the baseline scenario is slow, due to extensive logging\ndamage to the existing trees, competition from and suppression by climbers, vines and shrubs,\nand less availability of seeds from superior mother trees for natural regeneration. See also\nsection 1.7 of this Project Document on the initial conditions before the start of the project\nactivity. After a few decades the regrowth of the forest in the baseline is expected to increase,\n30\n\nVersion 1.7\nbecause the mortality that resulted from relogging normalizes and a part of the remaining\ntrees are able to outgrow the climbers and vines. However, especially on the long term,\ngrowth is much less than in the with-project scenario because a complete generation of trees\nthat are introduced with enrichment planting is lacking in the baseline scenario.

If the current land use continues, the project area in the North and in the South will remain\nin its current condition as it has since the 1980\u2019s. In the South of Guatemala, livestock grazing is the traditional land use. In the\nNorth of Guatemala, soils are largely unproductive for crop cultivation, and the land has been used extensively for cattle\ngrazing. In the North project area soils are compacted from continuous cattle grazing to the point that it is impossible to\ncultivate crops in the project area.\nIn this context, the continuation of the current situation and historical land use (no project activity or other alternatives\nundertaken) represents the only alternative to the project activity.\nLand use scenario a: Continuation of pre-project land use: pastureland\nAs detailed above, the project area is pasture with herbaceous vegetation, a few existing trees, and live fences. The project\narea has remained in a state of degraded or degrading pastureland since the 1980\u2019s. Without a change in land use practices for\npasture land the project area will remain in this state.\nThis activity is widespread, especially in the North. The lands neighbouring the project area in the North are also being used for\npasture.\nLand use scenario b: Crop production\nIn the North, although the project area might have supported crop production before grazing activities began, the soil is now\ntoo degraded for crop production. Attempts by the Project to interplant rows of rubber trees with corn were unsuccessful in\nthe North. Agricultural production in the North would result in low or no yields. In the South sugar cane production is\nwidespread in the lands surrounding the project area however the rocky soils and\/or slopes of the project area in the South\nmake it unsuitable for sugar cane production73.\nLand use scenario c: FSC certified rubber cultivation without registration as a VCS project\nThere is no legal requirement to reforest in the project area, and no FSC certified rubber plantations exist in Guatemala. The\nrisk associated with the establishment of rubber plantations is high due to substantial requirements for up-front investment\nand price fluctuations in the natural rubber market. Although incentives for the establishment of rubber plantations in some\nareas of the country (Verapaces and Izabal) are available from the Forest Incentive Plan (PINFOR) under Law No 101-61, these\nincentives do not cover a significant portion of the huge costs associated with rubber plantation establishment. As such they\nare insufficient to encourage the expansion of rubber plantations in the region.\nLand use scenario d: Non FSC certified rubber cultivation without registration as a VCS project\nThe traditional and common practice land use is crop production (see Land use scenario b), pasture lands (see land use scenario\na) and small scale natural rubber tree plantations (Non FSC certified and without Registration as a VCS project). The project\nproponent was committed since 200774 to lead the creation of incentives to responsibly increase the rate of rubber plantation\u2019s\nestablishment. In order to do so, the need to create diversified sources of revenue that allows rubber plantations to compete,\nunder a financial perspective, with traditional land use scenarios, was identified. In addition, the historical high fluctuation of\nrubber prices introduces uncertainty to financial models and expected future profits75. This situation marks the need to\ndiversify revenues from rubber plantations different from rubber production. This scenario in the south is prevented because\nthe all PICA\u2019s new model here explained is different from the traditional and common practice land use scenario, which is\ncoincident with Land use scenario d. Although rubber production in the south exists, almost all rubber production in southern\nGuatemala is produced by smallholders with plantations of less than 50 ha in size. Only 5% of the plantations associated with\nthe Rubber Producers Association of Guatemala (Gremial de Huleros de Guatemala) are greater than 200 ha in size76. The size\nof each proposed project plantation in the South is at least double the most common size of rubber plantations in Guatemala\n73 Ministerio de Agricultura, Ganaderia y Alimentacion de Guatemala. 2006.

Therefore, the project will lead to an increased rate\nof reforestation in southern Guatemala that would not occur in the absence of the project activity and that this results from\ndirect intervention by the project activity, and can be considered additional.\nLand use scenario e: Reforestation through direct planting of timber species without registration as a VCS Project\nThere is no legal requirement to reforest in the project area. Although incentives for the establishment of timber plantations\nare available from the Forest Incentive Plan (PINFOR) under Law No 101-61, these incentives have not been successful in\npromoting more than a low rate of forestation across the country which the country-wide rate of deforestation far outstrips.\nThe annual rate of forest plantation in Guatemala is 8,560 ha\/yr78 representing less than 0.08% of the total land area of\nGuatemala.

The end-user technology in the case of this project can\nbe established as the project proponent, who utilizes the thermal\nenergy generated by the new renewable energy technology.\nThere are no similar registered small-scale CDM project activities in\nthe region of Panorama once Social Carbon Company made a research and\ndid not find any registered small\u2013scale CDM Project activity in the\nregion. The sources of registered small-scale CDM project activity\nconsulted were the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange (UNFCCC)17 and Brazilian\u2019s Technology and Science Ministry18.\nTherefore, the proposed project activity is not saving the non-\nrenewable biomass accounted by the other registered project activities.\nThe utilization of firewood from area without any kind of management\ncan not be considered a renewable source of biomass, since it involves\na decrease of carbon pools and increases the carbon emissions to the\natmosphere, turning green house effect even worse. Moreover, the native\nwood provided from areas without a reforestation management plan does\nnot fit any of the options of UNFCCC definition of renewable biomass in\nAnnex 18, EB 23.\nFurthermore, firewood has been used for many decades as fuel in Brazil.\nAlthough, it is impossible to define a start date on which this kind of\nnon-renewable biomass began to be applied, there are many documents to\nprove that wood has been used for thermal energy generation before 1989\nas requested in the applied methodology. Firewood used to be the most\nemployed source of primary energy until de decade of 1970, when the\n17 CDM activities registered by CDM Executive board are Available at:<\n<http:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/Projects\/registered.html>.

Especially in the ceramic sector, the use of firewood\nis visible non-renewable and unsustainable, involving negative\nenvironmental impacts associated21.\nThis way, it can be concluded that non-renewable biomass has been used\nsince 31 December 1986.\nThe biomasses utilized in the project, sugar cane bagasse and sawdust,\nare common residues in the region generated. Bagasse is generated by\nindustries to produce alcohol. Each ton of sugar cane used for alcohol\nproduction generates around 140 kg of sugar cane bagasse, which can be\neither compacted into briquettes or utilized in natura for thermal\nenergy generation 22 .

Hebei province is land locked and borders\nInner Mongolia to the northwest, Shanxi to the southwest, Liaoning to the east and Henan to the north. The\npopulation of the province is 75.56 million. The project aims to plant native species on suitable land for\nforest with low vegetative coverage rate for GHG removal whilst contributing to local sustainable\ndevelopment goals.\n20,750 ha (311,250Mu13) of the forest was planted on suitable lands for forest with low vegetative coverage\nrate in Zhangbei county, which used to be poor sustainable ecological environment and rocky desertification.\nPrior to the project, although the project area is suitable for planting trees, it lacks proper forestry\nmanagement, resulting in lower coverage of trees. Besides, there has never been any activity affecting the\nlocal ecosystem in the project area14. By checking the afforestation plan, it was confirmed that, a small\nnumber of trees existed in some project area before the project started, but the coverage rate was extremely\nlow. So, considering the lower forest coverage, Zhangbei Forestry Bureau determined that the project area\nis suitable for afforestation after investigation, then the supplementary planting without disturbing the\nexisting trees was approved to increase the vegetative cover. All the trees were planted without disturbing\nthe existing trees in this report, and only the trees actually planted in this project were monitored. The\ncarbon credit of the original trees in the baseline scenario will not be monitored or counted in the actual net\nGHG removals by sink.\nThe project involves Zhangbei county, with a total population of nearly 370,000. All these lands for\nafforestation activities belong to the village committees. Zhangjiakou Sailin Landscaping Co., Ltd. (hereafter\nreferred to as Sailin Company) has been fully authorized by Zhangbei government, who represents all the\nvillage committees, through a signed contract to act as the project proponent to implement project\nmanagement and monitoring, and to sell VCUs generated from the project so that Sailin Company\nconsolidate the offset resources into sizeable forestry offset projects. The implementation of the project\nactivity has provided 11,265 jobs for local villagers, it includes 11,200 temporary planting jobs and 65 long-\nterm technician jobs, among which 60 percent are women. The employment period of temporary planting\nworkers was during the planting period of the project, from 12 May 2017 to 15 July 2017.\n13A Chinese metric unit of area, 1ha = 15 Mu.\n14 Land eligibility certificate issued by Zhangbei Forestry Bureau\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 9\n\nCCB + VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nThe project activity aims to:\n- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate change;\n- Enhance biodiversity conservation by increasing the connectivity of forests;\n- Improve soil and water conservation in the mountainous region and increase the forest cover;\n- Generate income and job opportunities for local communities.\nThere is no natural renewal and reforestation before the project, and all sites were suitable lands for forest\nwith low vegetative coverage rate. The main objective species is Pinus sylvestris15 (Mongolica) which is\nnative species according to the baseline survey.\nThe implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 3,900,753 tCO e 2\nin 20 years from 12-May-2017 to 11-May-2037, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 195,038\ntCO e. 2"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_country': 'China'}"}]}

Hence, leakage\nemissions are not applicable.\nCommercially Sensitive Information\nNo commercially sensitive information has been excluded from the public version of the project\ndescription.\nFurther Information\nGovernment of India has stipulated following indicators for sustainable development in the interim\napproval guidelines2 for CDM projects.\n1. Social well-being\n2. Economic well-being\n3. Environmental well-being\n4. Technological well-being\n1. Social well-being:\nThe main source for electricity generation for this power plant will be locally available agriculture\nwaste\/ woody biomass. The economy of the local people will be improved by selling biomass to\nthe power plant. Since the project is located in a village it will assist in alleviation of poverty to\ncertain extent by generating both direct and indirect employment in the area of skilled\/unskilled\njobs for regular operation and maintenance of the power plant.\n2\nMinistry of Environment and Forest web site: http:\/\/envfor.nic.in:80\/divisions\/ccd\/cdm_iac.html\nv3.2 10\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n2. Economic well-being:\nThe biomass gasification process is an alternative to fossil fuel based power plants and the\ndecentralized power generation through biomass gasification will reduce the transmission and\ndistribution losses. The project shall create new rural income resulting from the sales of biomass\nfuel like agriculture waste\/ woody biomass. Increased income levels shall contribute to the\neconomic safety and empowerment of the most vulnerable sections of local society.\n3. Environmental well-being:\nThe project is using biomass for power generation. There is no net GHG emission from this\nproject activity. Combustion of biomass in the proposed project does not result in net increase in\nGHG emissions of CO . In the absence of the project activity the biomass would have been 2\ndecayed in the land and would emit CH . Hence, the project activity is also reducing CH 4 4\nemission in the atmosphere.\nThus, the project causes no negative impact on the surrounding environment contributing to\nenvironmental well-being.\n4. Technological well-being:\nThe project makes use of efficient environmentally safe biomass gasification technology for\npower generation with no Green House Gas (GHG) emission. The recent development in the gas\ncooling and cleaning system provides dry producer gas with the tar and particulate level at an\nacceptable range.\nThe generation of electricity from the project leads to strengthening of the grid, increasing the\nenergy availability thereby meeting the energy demand to a certain extent leading to\ntechnological well-being.\nIn view of the above, the PP has considered that the project activity profoundly contributes to the\nsustainable development.\n2 APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY\n2.1 Title and Reference of Methodology\nTitle: Type-I, Renewable Energy Project\nMethodology: AMS I.D.

The area of interest for project activity instances meets the\neligibility criteria described in section 2.1.21) Eligibility Criteria for Grouped Projects (G1.14). Former land\nuse was mainly cattle ranching, which led to deforestation and soil degradation. The forest sites at the\nproject start are degraded farmland, ranchland or grassland, stubble, and some smaller secondary\nvegetation with no continuous forest cover and almost no valuable timber species present. In the case that\npatches of existing forest exist within the project area, they are kept to serve as protected forest areas or\nin some cases as sites for enrichment planting. The potential of these soils and the climate are suitable for\nreforestation with native species.\nFigure 8 Expansion area\nThe Generation Forest Group Project works currently within 2 Forest Management Units (Dari\u00e9n and\nCol\u00f3n), in central and eastern Panama. Currently, the project zone (under management) is 1887ha. Of the\n1887ha under management (Project Zone), 1,139ha hectares are eligible for AR CDM project activities\n(Project Area).

During the reforestation\nplanning phase and the elaboration of the forest management plan, potential areas to be reforested are\nidentified. As stated under section 2.1.21, eligible areas are those that were not previously used as forest\naccording to the MiAmbiente national definition and that have not been cleared in the 10 years prior to the\nstart of the reforestation activities. Eligible areas or potential areas were defined within the project\nproponents GIS system.\nIn preparation of the VCS\/CCB project, eligibility maps were elaborated for each property (finca) using the\nprogram QGIS (section 2.1.7). The project proponent contacted several governmental, private and research\ninstitutions in the country to allow a review on existing historic maps and the development of land use for\neach property. For the analysis period (2000-2015), due to poor data and heavy cloud cover in Panama,\nhigh-resolution satellite imagery of the quality required to adequately analyze the areas was not available.\nHowever, the Ministry of Environment (formerly ANAM) provided forest cover and land use maps in which\nthe whole country of Panama was categorized in different land uses. For the eligibility analysis, ANAM\nforest cover and land use maps from 2000 (ANAM, 2000) and 2012 (ANAM, 2012) were used. Those maps\nallowed to compare former forest cover and land use, and proved that areas were mainly used for cattle\nranching, only smaller patched were defined as stubble, secondary vegetation, or forest. All the areas with\nformer forest cover were excluded from the eligibility area and this project.

This process lasted\nmany years and resulted in an irreversible change in the composition of affected ecosystems with\nobvious soil erosion and habitat fragmentation.\nThe first project activities began in 2010, where nearly 57 ha spread over twenty areas were\nforested. These plantations were established in areas without tree cover, and by using species of\nthe Nothofagus genus, such as the Coihue (N. betuloides) and \u00d1irre (N. antarctica).\nForestation activities involve a series of steps aimed at creating a well-planned planting\nprogramme. The main forestation steps are the following:\n- Identifying suitable planting areas,\n- Preparing or readying the land to be planted,\n- Transporting the saplings from the nursery to our properties, and remote planting\nareas,\n- Planting itself.\nSuch preparation requires special attention on the land in order to make the correct decisions at\nthe right time, as well as keeping the relevant records.\nIdentifying planting areas\nThe Forestry Operations Manager and Sub-manager of SNP Patagonia Sur identify the planting\nareas using GIS maps and observations in the field. Once the afforested areas are selected, they\nare clearly delineated through the use of a GPS in the field. The points are subsequently imported\nto ArcGIS and Google Earth, where the necessary maps are later generated in order to be\npresented to CONAF and any other institutions that require them.\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nAt this point, the managers determine which species and how many of each species should be\nplanted in each location. The Forestry Operations Manager relies on knowledge of terrain and\nhydrologic conditions to decide which species are most suitable for each area.\nOnce the planting areas are identified, the managers proceed to determine the roads and paths\nwe will use to supply those areas with plants. These paths are cleared by using hand tools, such\nas machetes, weed eaters and chainsaws when necessary. It should be noted that the planting\nareas do not usually have access for vehicles, for which reason horses (pack horses) are needed\nto help supplying the planting areas with saplings.\nFence Building and Repair\nIt is important to maintain a good fence around reforestation sectors, so that animals in\nneighbouring premises and those using the roads to reach summer pastures do not destroy the\nplants. This work is done by staff that maintain Valle California\u2019s premises. They generally use\nrecycled materials and fallen trees for repairing the fences.\nPlant Supply\nThe supply of plants comes from the Vivero Ma\u00f1ihuales nursery, owned by the company Forestal\nMininco, located in the region of Ays\u00e9n. The nursery has broad experience in the production of\nexotic plants and in recent years, has been taking advantage of its greenhouse and irrigation\ninfrastructure, as well as fertilization equipment to produce native plants.\nDuring the 2011 season, 226,500 plants were procured from the nursery. These were divided in\nthe following amounts:\n- Coihues: 100,000 plants (Nothofagus betuloides)\n- Lengas: 71,500 plants (Nothofagus pumilio)\n- \u00d1irres: 55,000 plants (Nothofagus antarctica)\nTotal 226,500 plants\nThrough an exploratory trip by the Forestry Operation Manager, it was established that the Vivero\nMa\u00f1ihuales nursery works with transplants from natural nurseries. These plants are deposited in\ncontainers and conditioned through controlled temperature, fertilization and irrigation for 1 year.\nDuring the final weeks prior to transportation, the seedlings proceed to \"hardening\", which\ninvolves applying calcium and waiting for the vegetative growth to end and the seedling to\nbecome dormant in order to ready them for transport to the field. The nursery must meet this\ncondition that the seedlings are dormant before determining the transport date. In 2011, transport\nbegan on April 18th using Patagonia Sur\u2019s truck.\nThe transport boxes hold about 200 seedlings each (the exact number per box depends on their\nsize and foliage). In addition, a gel is applied in order to keep the plants moist during\ntransportation. When the plants arrive at the premises, they are stored in a warehouse to avoid\nthe low temperatures of the area. A Unimoc truck is used to bring the plants nearer to the planting\nareas. Subsequently, pack horses are used to transport the plants to the planting sites. Each\nhorse can carry around 500 to 800 plants, depending on the plants\u2019 size and foliage.\nPlant Quality\nPlants coming from the nursery must have the shape of the container that held them when they\nwere in the nursery, with fine or secondary roots that look white. Plants must appear without\nscrapes on the stems or cracked trunks.\n10\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nThe nursery is requested to deliver seedlings with a root\/shoot mass ratio that is not less than\n2:1, in order to ensure a balance of nutrients and water during transport. Furthermore, the stem\nmust be ligneous with a diameter below 3 millimeters (mm) so that the plant to has a greater\npotential to withstand extremely cold and snowy conditions.\nDamaged plants or those that do not meet the minimal conditions requested are sent back to the\nnursery for replanting.\nWeed control\nThis task consists in the reduction or elimination of vegetation competing with the species being\nplanted, preventing competition for water, light and nutrients. This activity is needed for proper\nestablishment and growth of the plantation. No chemical weed control will be employed.\nWeed control becomes even more relevant considering the topographic restrictions of the area.\nFor proper control, grass weeds must be eliminated in a 30 x 30 centimeter (cm) square where\nthe plant will be located. The bushes in the planting area will not be eliminated. They will be used\nfor the protection of the new plant according to a \"plant nursery\" technique.\nSoil Preparation\nThis task involves modifying the surface layer of the soil to enhance its physical conditions, thus\nfacilitating the establishment of plants. The soil should be soft and weed-free in a 30 x 30 cm\nsquare, with a depth of 25 cm. This way, the soil can retain the appropriate amount of water,\ntherefore encouraging better root development for plants.\nSoil preparation will not be conducted with heavy machinery. Only hand tools, such as, machetes,\nshovels and brush cutters will be used, if necessary.\nPest Control\nThe main potential risk from pests to the plantation is the presence of Hares (Lepus europaeus)\n(common name: hares) in the reforestation area. The damage they produce may be significant as\nthey can cut off the tops of plants.\nAn effective natural control in the population of hares is also expected due to the strong presence\nof foxes in the area. The extent of the damage caused by hares will be monitored through\npermanent plots. The first examination of damage from hares yielded the results that the hares\nare not yet a major factor.\nThe other problem that will directly affect our plantation is the explosive increase of rodents in the\narea throughout this year, mainly due to the flowering of the Quila (Chusquea quila). The extent\nof this damage will be monitored through permanent plots.\nPlanting Methodology\nThe seedlings will be planted at a density of 1,700 plants per hectare (pl\/ha) distributed\nheterogeneously within standard 100 m2 plots. Therefore the plantation will not be established in\nrows, but it will use a system that divides a surface of 100 m2 in 3 rectangles. 6 plants are placed\nin the outer rectangles and 5 plants are placed in the center rectangle, totalling 17 plants in\n100m2. This will lead to a consistent density of 1,700 pl\/ha (see Figure 2), though in a\nheterogeneous pattern (see Figure 3).\n3 workers or jaloneros will mark the plots, measure and staking the corners of each 100m2\nsquare.\n11"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}"}]}

The AQRP is located within the area of the Association of Traditional Indigenous\nAuthorities of Querar\u00ed (ASATIQ), which is part of the Great Eastern Indigenous Reservation of Vaup\u00e9s in\nthe municipality of Mit\u00fa, in the department of Vaup\u00e9s, Colombia. ASATIQ\u2019s territory is located in the\nColombian Amazon biome and the AQRP covers an area of 391,310 ha. There are four globally\nendangered animal species whose range extends into the project area: Ateles belzebuth (White-bellied\nspider monkey), Inia geoffrensis (Amazon river dolphin); Pteronura brasiliensis (giant otter); and Sotalia\nfluviatilis (tucuxi).\nBetween 2000 and 2017, the Amazon biome had an annual average deforestation of 82,332 ha, which\nrepresents 56% of the total area deforested in Colombia during that period. Mit\u00fa had the most\ndeforestation in the department of Vaup\u00e9s, losing 28,400 ha between 2001 and 2021 (Global Forest\nWatch). Under these circumstances, the without-project scenario presents an unplanned use of forest\nresources with the expansion of the agricultural frontier through subsistence crops, which are being\ndeveloped progressively thereby putting at risk the ecosystem balance of the forests and the cultural\ntraditions of the communities.\nActivities to reduce deforestation include recovering and improving traditional production practices,\ngenerating income from the implementation of agricultural, forestry business models and strengthening\nself-government. Project activities will contribute to improving living conditions, land governance, and\nforest protection in the ASATIQ territory. Actions in the medium- and long-term have been defined to\nsupport the territory\u2019s self-governance principles, as well as to promote the development of local\ntraditional practices and ancestral education. The proposals made are framed in alignment with the\ngeneral action lines of the ASATIQ Life Plan.\n10 Per IUCN\u2019s Red List of Threatened Species\n11 In the absence of direct population or occupancy measures, measurement of reduced threats may be used as\nevidence of benefit\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3\n10\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nThe AQRP estimates an annual average reduction of 663,629 tCO2e and a total reduction of approximately\n20,572,492 over the project\u2019s life of 30 years. The project lifetime is November 8, 2019 to November 7,\n2049.\nThe objectives of the AQMP are to:\n\u2022 Reduce GHG emissions from deforestation activities, by improving traditional production practices and\nstrengthening community governance in the area of the AQMP.\n\u2022 Improve the living conditions of ASATIQ communities, through the implementation of initiatives that\ncontribute to the provision of food, diversification and improvement of diet, and creation of sources of\nincome in the project area.\n\u2022 Reduce pressure on forest ecosystems and its biodiversity, through the implementation of activities\nthat improve traditional production practices and the diversification of chagra products."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_state_province': 'Department of Vaup\u00e9s', 'project_country': 'Colombia'}"}]}

Electricity in\nKarnataka is mainly generated from the fossil fuel dominated power plants. In the absence of the project\nactivity, equivalent amount of electricity would have been generated by the operation of fossil fuel\ndominated power plants.

Prior to the project activity, the\nland had no beneficial use. Savita Oil Technologies has bought the land for a worthwhile application and\nobtained necessary approvals for installation of wind turbines. No dislocation of people is involved in the\ncourse of the project activity. The project was implemented on forest land leased out by the government of\nIndia for the explicit purpose of the setting up of renewable energy projects.\nThe terrain comprises hilly areas, which are sparingly populated, the hills are generally covered with\nshrubs and grass, and trees are not found on the hilltops. Moreover, the project area doesn\u2019t fall under any\nprotected land for wildlife and it has no adverse ecological impacts on the surroundings, flora and fauna\nfound in the vicinity of the project area.

Therefore, the proposed project\nactivity is not saving the non-renewable biomass accounted by the other\nregistered project activities.\nThe utilization of firewood from area without any kind of management can not\nbe considered a renewable source of biomass, since it involves a decrease of\ncarbon pools and increases the carbon emissions to the atmosphere, turning\ngreen house effect even worse. Moreover, the native wood provided from areas\nwithout a reforestation management plan does not fit any of the options of\nUNFCCC definition of renewable biomass in Annex 18, EB 23.\nFurthermore, firewood has been used for many decades as fuel in Brazil16.\nAlthough, it is impossible to define a start date on which this kind of non-\nrenewable biomass began to be applied, there are many documents to prove that\nwood has been used for thermal energy generation before 1989 as requested in\nthe applied methodology.

Accordingly, the applicable methodology for the project activity shall\nbe AMS I.D\/ Version 10,, which includes hydro for electricity generation for a grid system.\nApplication of environmentally sound and safe technology\nThe technology of power generation process using hydro resources is converting the kinetic energy\navailable in the water flow into mechanical energy using hydro turbines and then to electrical energy\nusing alternators. The generated power will be transformed to match the voltage of nearest grid sub-\nstation for proper interconnection and smooth evacuation of power. In this process there are no\ngreenhouse gas emissions or burning of any fossil fuels. Thus electricity is generated through sustainable\nmeans without causing any negative effect on the environment. Therefore the technology is\nenvironmentally safe and sound.\nNo technology transfer is envisaged for the CDM project activity.\nTechnical details of the project activity\nThe project is a run of the river scheme where there is no reservoir upstream and involves construction of\na diversion structure, power canal, forebay, penstock, power house and power evacuation system. The\nproject comprises two identical power-generating units of capacity 4.5 MW each. Power will be\ngenerated at 11 kV which will be stepped up to 33 kV for interfacing with the grid system at the nearest\nKPTCL\u2019s Pilakala substation.

The project aims to plant native species on suitable land for forest14 for GHG removal\nwhilst contributing to local sustainable development goals.\n37,400.59 ha (561,008.85 Mu15) of the forest was planted on suitable land for forest in Yulong Naxi\nAutonomous County, which used to be poor sustainable ecological environment and rocky desertification.\nPrior to the project, although the project area is suitable for planting trees, it lacks proper forestry\nmanagement, resulting in lower coverage of trees. Besides, there has never been any activity affecting\nthe local ecosystem in the project area16. By checking the afforestation plan with Yulong Naxi\nAutonomous County Forestry and Grassland Bureau, it was confirmed that, a small number of trees have\nbeen planted in some project area before the project started, but the coverage rate was extremely low. So,\nconsidering the lower forest coverage, Yulong Naxi Autonomous County Forestry and Grassland Bureau\ndetermined that the project area is suitable for afforestation after investigation, then the supplementary\nplanting without disturbing the existing trees was approved to increase the vegetative cover. All the trees\nwere planted without disturbing the existing trees in this project, and only the trees actually planted in this\nproject were monitored. The carbon credit of the original trees in the baseline scenario will not be\nmonitored or counted in the actual net GHG removals by sinks.\nThe project activity aims to:\n- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate change;\n- Enhance biodiversity conservation by increasing the connectivity of forests;\n- Improve soil and water conservation in the mountainous region and increase the forest cover;\n13 Naxi nationality is one of the 55 ethnic minorities in China.\n14 According to the \u201cChinese terms in resource and technology\u201d issued by the China Science Publishing &\nMedia Ltd., the definition of suitable land for forest refers to the land type with suitable site conditions for\nforest growth programmed by People\u2019s governments at or above the county level. The suitable land for\nforest described in this project is programmed by Yulong Naxi Autonomous County Forestry and\nGrassland Bureau, and a small number of trees have been planted in some project area before the\nproject started but the coverage rate of planting trees is low, so the Yulong Naxi Autonomous County\nForestry defines the project area as the suitable land for forest.\n15A Chinese metric unit of area, 1ha = 15 Mu.\n16 It was proved by Certificate of Land Eligibility\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 8\n\nCCB + VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\n- Generate income and job opportunities for local communities.\nThere is no natural renewal and reforestation before the project, and all sites were suitable land for forest.\nThe main objective species are Pinus yunnanensis (Yunnan Pine) 17 and Picea asperata (Spruce)18 which\nare native species according to the baseline survey.\nThe implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 22,959,273\ntCO e in 30 years from 16-June-2018 to 15-June-2048, with an average annual GHG emission removal 2\nof 765,309 tCO e. 2"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_state_province': 'Yunnan province', 'project_country': 'China'}"}]}

The total installed\ncapacity of 21.6 MW comprises of 12 WTGs, each with a capacity of 1.80 MW. The project\nprovides electricity to the state of Gujarat by effective utilization of renewable resources. The\ntechnology has been supplied by Vestas. The project utilizes wind energy for exporting electricity\nwhich otherwise would have been generated through alternate fuels (most likely - fossil fuel)\nbased power plants, contributing to reduction in specific emissions (emissions of pollutant)\nincluding GHG emissions. Electricity produced from the project activity is supplied to NEWNE\n(Now Indian grid) grid of India.\nEmission reductions are claimed on the net electrical energy that is supplied to grid which is\nmetered using meters located at the electrical yard of the respective WTGs. These electrical\nenergy meters are electronic tri-vector meters of appropriate accuracy class. Since these meters\nare not designed to measure high voltages and currents as generated in the WTG, the WTG output\nis connected to these meters via transformers (CT\/PT) for stepping down the generated voltage\nand current to ranges which the meters can record. As such, these meters have a multiplying\nfactor which when multiplied to the meter reading provides the actual amount of electricity\ngenerated. The technology providers for the project have additionally installed an LCS meter at\nthe WTG controller.\nThe electricity generated is monitored using electrical meters which provide a measure of the\nactual electrical energy that would have been sourced from a fossil-fuel based power plants in\nthe absence of the project activity. Hence, the fossil-fuel power based grid is the baseline for the\nproject activity. The annual GHG emission reductions from project activity is estimated to be\n52,108 tCO e. Thus the proposed project activity leads to an emission reduction of 521,080 2\ntCO e over the chosen crediting period of ten years 2\nThe project is a Greenfield wind power project and does not involve generation of GHG emissions\nfor the purpose of their subsequent reduction, removal or destruction. Thus prior to project\ninitiation, there was nothing at site. In absence of project activity, the continuation of current\npractice i.e. generation of equivalent amount electricity would have been generated from grid\nconnected fossil fuel dominated power plants. Thus for project activity baseline scenario is\nelectricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by\nthe operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources.\nThe total emission reductions achieved by this project activity in the monitoring period from 01-\nJanuary-2021 to 31-December-2021, are 41,683 tCO e through displacing 44,623.91 MWh of 2\nelectricity from fossil-fuel dominated electricity grid with electricity generation using wind energy\nresources."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_state_province': 'Gujarat', 'project_country': 'India'}"}]}

Water balance is the\nmass balance of water fed to power units, with all possible combinations of multiple reservoirs and without the\nconstruction of reservoirs. The purpose of such water balance is to demonstrate the requirement of specific\ncombination of multiple reservoirs constructed under CDM project activity for the optimization of power output. This\ndemonstration has to be carried out in the specific scenario of water availability in different seasons to optimize the\nwater flow at the inlet of power units. Therefore this water balance will take into account seasonal flows from river,\ntributaries (if any), and rainfall for minimum three years prior to implementation of CDM project activity.\nv3.1 14\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nProject activities that involve switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources at the site of\nthe project activity, since in this case the baseline may be the continued use of fossil fuels at the\nsite;\nThe proposed project activity does not involve switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy at the\nsite of the project activity.\nBiomass fired power plants;\nThe proposed project activity does not involve biomass fired power plants.\nHydro power plants that result in new reservoirs or in the increase in existing reservoirs where the\npower density of the power plant is less than 4 W\/m2.\nThe project activity is a hydro power plant without reservoir; thus this criterion is not relevant.\nIn the case of retrofits, replacements, or capacity additions, this methodology is only applicable if\nthe most plausible baseline scenario, as a result of the identification of baseline scenario, is \u201cthe\ncontinuation of the current situation, i.e. to use the power generation equipment that was already in\nuse prior to the implementation of the project activity and undertaking business as usual\nmaintenance\u201d.\nThis condition is not relevant since the project activity does not involve any capacity additions,\nretrofit or replacements, but consists of the installation of a completely new power plant.\nThus, the methodology is applicable to the proposed project activity.\nThe \u201cTool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system\u201d (version 3.0.0) is applied to calculate\nbaseline emissions for a project activity that substitutes grid electricity. Under this tool, the emission factor\nfor the project electricity system can be calculated either for grid power plants only or, as an option, can\ninclude off-grid power plants. In the latter case, there are specific conditions that should be met. Since the\nelectricity system affected by the proposed project activity includes only grid connected power plants, no\nspecific conditions has to be assessed. Further, the tool would not be applicable if the project electricity\nsystem is located partially or totally in an Annex-I country, which for the proposed project activity is not the\ncase."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_methodologies': ['ACM0002']}"}]}

This province is land\nlocked and borders Yunnan to the west, Sichuan to the northwest, Hunan to the East and Chongqing to\nthe North. The population of the province is 34million.\nThe Xiguan Afforestation Project (hereafter referred as \u201cthe Project\u201d) is located within Xixiu District and\nGuanling Buyi and Miao Autonomous County (Guanling County or Guanling). The project is to plant\nnative species on barren land for purposes of GHG removal whilst contributing to local sustainable\ndevelopment goals. The project is implemented jointly by the Forestry Bureau of Xixiu District and\nForestry Bureau of Guanling County.25,449ha of forest was planted on degraded lands in Xixiu District\nand Guanling County.\nThe project involves a total of 323 villages in Xixiu District and Guanling County, with a total population of\nnearly 132,897. All the barren lands for afforestation activities belong to the villagers and the village\ncommittees manage the lands on behalf of villagers. Guizhou Baiheng Fertilizer Co., Ltd (hereinafter\nreferred to as Guizhou Baiheng or Baiheng) has been fully authorized by all the village committees to act\nas the project proponent to implement project management and monitoring and to sell VCUs generated\nfrom the project, which enables Baiheng to consolidate the offset resources into sizeable forestry offset\nprojects. Baiheng will profit-share with the villagers from the sale of VCUs. The implementation of the\nproject activity has provided 19,090 jobs for local farmers, among which 70 percent are women.\nThe project activity aims to:\n- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate change;\n- Enhance biodiversity conservation by increasing the connectivity of forests;\n- Improve soil and water conservation in the Karst region and increase the forest cover;\n- Generate income and job opportunities for local village communities.\nThere is no natural renewal and afforestation before the project, and all sites were covered by the barren\nland. The main species planted is Cypress and China fir which are native species according to the\nbaseline survey.\nThe implementation of the project would reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 11,652,613 tCO e over 2\nthe next 30 years, with an average annual GHG emission of 388,420 tCO e. 2\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 8\n\nCCB + VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_state_province': 'Guizhou Province', 'project_country': 'China'}"}]}

E. and SCHAFFER, W. B., 2010). However\nthere is wetland features in Pratigi EPA, this type of ecosystem will not be subject to the project activity, as\ndescribed in the IPCC Good Practice Guidance for LULUCF (Soils with restricted drainage leading to periodic\nflooding and anaerobic conditions).\nb) Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10 per cent of area in each\nof the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project boundary:\ni. Land containing organic soils;\nii. Land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and receives inputs\nlisted in appendices 2 and 3 to this methodology.\nRationale: The areas to be reforested under this Grouped Project does not encompass areas with organic\nsoil, once most of them are characterized as degraded pasture with low percentage of organic matter (less\nthan 12% of organic carbon in its first 20cm).\nThe technology to be employed under the Grouped Project is based in three different restoration models,\nas presented in section 1.8. Only two of them have the potential to cause some kind of soil disturbance:\nmodels 1 (Total Seedling) and model 3 (SAF). However, none of these two models are supposed to be\nimplemented in short-term or set aside cropland23 or grassland, but mainly in abandoned degraded pasture.\nThus, neither cropland nor grassland in the baseline is subjected to land-use and management practices\nsuch described in appendices 2 and 3 of the referred methodology. However if some PAI encompasses one\n23 Cropland does not make part of the Grouped project boundary\nv3.1 59\n\n[['\\uf0d8 For the \"VT0001: Tool for the Demonstration and Assessment of Additionality in VCS Agriculture, Forestry'], ['and Other Land Use (AFOLU) Project Activities, v3.0\" the Grouped Project meets all the following'], ['applicability conditions:'], ['']]\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nof these categories, measures (as manual plantation, and plow avoidance), will be adopted to avoid\ndisturbance in more than 10% of these areas,\n\uf0d8 The \u201cCombined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality in A\/R CDM project\nactivities\u201d version 01, is not applicable to this Grouped Project, once the tool states in its second\napplicability condition: \"This tool is not applicable to small - scale afforestation and reforestation project\nactivities\".

The generated electricity will be fed into\ngrid, thereby improving the grid frequency and availability of electricity which will provide new\nopportunities for industries and economic activities for greater local employment and\ndevelopment. The project activity also leads to diversification of the national energy supply,\nwhich is dominated by conventional fuel based generating units.\n\uf0b7 Use of renewable energy source (wind energy\/solar power) also helps in conservation of\nnatural resources (like coal) in the country & thus less GHG\u201fs emissions in the atmosphere\n\uf0b7 The project contributes to the economic sustainability around the plant sites, which is\npromotion of decentralization of economic power\nSocial well being:\n\uf0b7 The plant sites are isolated rural areas which are the victims of unemployment, poverty and\nother social backwardness. The project would lead to the development of these regions.\n\uf0b7 The proposed project would enhance availability of power to the local industries, agriculture\nand commercial activities in the vicinity of the project area by augmenting power supply to the\nSouthern and NEWNE grid, thereby improving quality of power supplied to various users by\nstabilizing the grid.\n\uf0b7 During civil works, a lot of construction work took place, which generated employment for\nlocal people around the plant site.\n\uf0b7 Other than these, there are various kinds of mechanical work, which would generate\nemployment opportunity on regular and permanent basis\n\uf0b7 Frequency of visits by skilled, technical personnel and industrialists will increase due to\ninstallation \/ site visit \/ operation and maintenance work related to WTGs and solar projects.\nThis directly and indirectly positively effects the social behaviour & economy of villages and\nnearby area.\nEnvironmental well being:\n\uf0b7 The Wind\/Solar power is one of the cleanest renewable energy powers and does not involve\nany fossil fuel. There are no GHG emissions.\n4 http:\/\/www.cdmindia.gov.in\/approval_process.php\nv3.2 13\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n\uf0b7 There is no impact on land, water, air and soil due to the installation of WTGs\/solar projects.\nThus the project activity contributes to environmental well-being without causing any negative\nimpact on the surrounding environment.\nTechnological well being:\n\uf0b7 The project activity is step forward in harnessing the untapped wind\/solar potential and\nfurther diffusion of the technology in the region.\n\uf0b7 The project activity leads to the promotion of WTGs and demonstrates the success of wind\nturbines in the region which further motivate more investors to invest in wind power projects.\nSimilarly the project helps in promoting more and more solar power projects.

All factors relevant to their\ndetermination apply to the entire geographic area, which has clearly defined boundaries in KML format\n(Annexe 31B for outer boundary).\nThe baseline scenario and demonstration of additionality are based on the initial project activity instances.\nThe initial instances consist of the conservation of high forest, otherwise imminently threatened with\nclearance for agriculture, on small holdings, within the small holder community La Amistad, which was\nresettled on land redistributed under the Paraguayan Agrarian Reform Programme within the remnants of\nthe Atlantic Forest within the project boundary. New project instances will be replications of the initial\ninstances, with allowance for minor modifications to meet specific site conditions. They must:\n\uf0b7 Lie within the grouped project boundary as defined in Annexe 31B;\n\uf0b7 Meet the applicability conditions set out in the methodology applied to the project (See 2.2\nbelow).\n\uf0b7 Consist of Payments for Ecosystem Services made for the conservation of high forest, otherwise\nimminently threatened with clearance for agriculture, on small holdings, within small holder\ncommunities that have been resettled on land redistributed under the Paraguayan Agrarian Reform\nProgramme within the remnants of the Atlantic Forest within the project boundary i.e. qualify as\nAvoiding Planned Deforestation activities, be subject to the same baseline scenario determined for\nthis activity in the grouped project area, have characteristics with respect to additionality that are\nconsistent with the initial instances and use the same measures applied to these, in the same\nmanner, specified in this project description.\nLeakage Management\nAs the project limits the collection of fuel wood within part of the agents\u2019 property, leakage mitigation\nmeasures are in place. Forest rangers employed by Guyra Paraguay patrol the surrounding forest which is\npredominantly owned by Guyra Paraguay (Map 2).\nFurther, Payments for Ecosystem Services will be made to qualifying small holders for\nreforestation. This activity is technically reforestation (ARR) rather than REDD and is not intended\nto be included in the calculation of emissions reductions. This area will be used to meet basic\nneeds and reduces the need to meet these needs from the wider forest.\nFurther, the forest areas on the participants\u2019 properties that are not submitted to the project and the project\nreforestation areas are to be managed sustainably under principles for conservation management. Also, the\nproject forest will be left unmanaged and a very conservative, sustainable off-take of wood fuel from\nthe project area (in the form of deadwood), well within the ability of the forest to replace when left\nunmanaged is to be allowed, commencing in year 6 of the project. This, as opposed to a completely\nv3.2 17\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nprotective regime, represents a leakage mitigation action and substitutes a controlled for an uncontrolled\nsystem of resource use. Further, retaining forest reduces the area available for cultivation or\npasturage by community members, which must be compensated by enhanced productivity on the\nsmaller area that remains. Both the management of the forest and the development of the\nparticipants\u2019 agricultural systems are technical areas in which the community requires additional\nsupport services. The project budget therefore allows for provision of expert advice to the relevant\nsmall holders within the communities in:\n\uf0b7 Enhancing income and productivity from small-holder agriculture.\n\uf0b7 Sustainable community forest management - for the non-project forest.(Annex 2 -\nPincipios para conservaci\u00f3n de Bosques).\nThis support will contribute directly to the efficient use of resources; in forest on the participants\u2019\nproperties that has not been submitted to the project, in the reforestation areas and in terms of\nthe utilisation of cleared land. It therefore mitigates leakage. Regular visits to La Amistad by the\nproject Forestry Officer and the Agricultural Extension Officer will be made in order to implement\nthis plan.\nCommercially Sensitive Information\nThe management contracts between SPO and WLT, and WLT and Guyra Paraguay, plus their\ndetailed budgets, are excluded from the public version of the project description.

The project activity is a renewable\nbiomass based thermal energy generation project. The project activity entails\ninstallation of a biomass fired boiler to meet the process steam requirements.\nThereby the primary applicability of the category I C is suitably justified. The\ndetailed justification on applicability of the methodology to the project activity\nis provided below.\nJustification of applicability of the methodology\n1. This category comprises renewable energy technologies that supply\nindividual households or users with thermal energy that displaces fossil fuels.\nExamples include solar thermal water heaters and dryers, solar cookers, energy\nderived from renewable biomass for water heating, space heating or drying and\nother technologies that provide thermal energy that displaces fossil fuel.\nBiomass based co-generating systems that produce heat and electricity are\nincluded in this category.\nThe project activity is use of biomass in boiler to meet the process heat\nrequirement by avoiding the use of fossil fuel in boiler. Hence this satisfies the\nfirst applicability condition of the methodology.\n2. Where thermal generation capacity is specified by the manufacturer. It shall\nbe less than 45 MW . th\n5\nhttp:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/UserManagement\/FileStorage\/CDMWF_AM_YL0327DQSKVFXYQREWRT3V\nNR58402G\n15\n\n[['Boiler Capacity', 'TPH', '10', '3'], ['Pressure', 'kg\/cm2', '17.5', '10.54'], ['Steam Enthalpy', 'kJ\/kg', '2796.65', '2782.41'], ['Thermal Output', 'MWthermal', '7.77', '2.32']]\nUnder the project activity two boilers of 10 TPH and 3 TPH capacity each\ngenerating saturated steam at a pressure rating of 17.5 kg\/cm2 and 10.54 kg\/cm2\nrespectively are installed. The combined thermal energy production capacity of\nthe boilers is 10.09 MW thermal (less than 45 MWthermal). As 10.09 MWth is\nless than 45 MWth, it qualifies the project as a small scale activity as per the\ncondition given in the methodology.\n3. For Co- fired systems the aggregate installed capacity(Specific for fossil fuel\nuse) of all the systems affected by the project activity shall not exceed 45 MWth.\nCogeneration projects that displace\/avoid fossil fuel consumption in the\nproduction of thermal energy(eg. Steam or process heat) and\/or electricity shall\nuse this methodology. The capacity of the project in this case shall be the\nthermal energy production capacity ie 45 MWth.\nThis case is not relevant to the project activity as the aim of the project activity\nis to use only biomass residue as fuel in the project activity and no other fossil\nfuel will be used.\n4. In the case of the project activity that involves the addition of renewable\nenergy unit at an existing renewable facility. The total capacity of the units\nadded by the project should be lower than 45MWth and should be physically\ndistinct from the existing units.\nThe above mentioned case is not relevant to the project activity as the project\nactivity is the first ever installation of renewable energy facility in the plant.\nIt can be concluded from the above mentioned points that the project activity\nsatisfies all the applicability conditions of the methodology and hence this\nmethodology is applicable in context with the project activity."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

The amount of waste combusted represents the waste that\nwould have been landfilled in the absence of the Project activity. Total Facility waste processed\nis determined from waste received, corrected for waste inventory in the storage pit. Waste\nreceived is determined with truck scales, which are operated and maintained by the County,\ntested and calibrated at least semi-annually, and used by the County for billing purposes. The\namount of waste processed by the Project activity is determined by prorating the total Facility\nwaste processed by the steam generation by unit. Each of the units are of similar design and\noperate at the same pressure and consequently have comparable efficiencies. Each boiler is\nfed from the same pit; therefore, the fuel is consistent between the four units.\nBaseline emissions associated with displaced fossil based grid electrical generation are\ncalculated by measuring the net electrical generation from Turbine Generator #2 (TG2) which is\ndedicated to the Project activity (Unit #4). The net electrical generation reflects the actual\nelectricity delivered to the grid. Parasitic loads (e.g. feedwater pumps, air compressors) of the\nFacility are not included in the net generation. Facility meters that measure electrical output to\nthe grid are verified against the State Rd 60 switchyard meter which is used for revenue\npurposes and is owned by the utility.\nDuring the first two months of the Project operation (August and September), Unit #4 net\nelectrical output was not measured by the distributed control system (DCS). For these two\nmonths, net generation from TG2 was prorated based on the gross from each of the two turbine\ngenerators.\nProject emissions are calculated from data obtained by monitoring the total steam generation,\nnatural gas consumption as an auxiliary fuel, diesel consumption for heavy equipment used to\nmanage the waste brought into the facility, purchased grid electricity, and the fossil-based\nfraction of total stack CO . Beginning with the 2011 emissions year, after U.S. EPA regulations 2\nrequiring stack monitoring of CO emissions from municipal waste combustors sized at 600 tons 2\nper day or above go into effect, project emissions of CO will be measured using a continuous 2\nemission rate monitoring system (CERMS).

Each boiler at the Facility\nhas a gas meter. Total gas consumption as measured by billing meter is then allocated\nbetween the boilers, including the Project boiler.\nDiesel consumption is determined from purchase records. For GHG emission calculation\npurposes, diesel purchases are adjusted at the end and beginning of the year (or partial year to\nreflect Project operation in 2009) as needed so a full year, or the relevant Project operation\nperiod, is reflected. Tank inventories are not taken at the beginning and end of the year.\nRelative to annual diesel consumption, tank capacities are small (~500 gal. for mobile\nequipment, 250 gal. for fire pump) and do not have a potential to generate significant errors in\ndiesel consumption as predicted by purchases. Diesel consumption is not specifically tracked\nby unit. Therefore, in order to estimate the diesel consumed in support of the Project activity,\ntotal diesel consumption is prorated by the tons processed by Unit #4. Given that diesel is\npredominately used to handle MSW on the tipping floor, diesel consumption by boiler is\nproportional to MSW processed per unit.\nRarely, during complete facility black outages, power is purchased from the grid and billed by\nthe utility. Purchased electricity is prorated based on steam generation by unit.\nWhen data, except for diesel consumption, is prorated, the proration is performed monthly.\nDiesel fuel is prorated on an annual basis. For the year 2009, only data from July to December\nis considered to align with the project start date.\nThe type of information reported is outlined in Table 8 below.

Grouped Project activity is eligible to use the methodology indicated above, since\nproject activity generates and exports renewable electricity to a grid system, dominated by\nthermal energy sources. The capacity of the project activity is well below the qualifying limit\nfor project activities under small scale methodology AMS.I.D Ver.13, i.e., 15 MW. Hence,\nAMS.I.D \u201cGrid connected renewable electricity generation\u201d methodology is applied for the\nproject activity.\n1. Since, the grouped project activity is a grid connected hydro power project, therefore this\nmethodology is applicable.\n2. Project activity proposes to generate 4.5 MW electricity using renewable hydel power which\nis less than 15 MW. Hence, it is a small scale project activity.\n3. Project activity is only for renewable electricity generation and not co-generation type.\n4. Project activity is a new unit, green field project activity and the project activity does not\nseek to retrofit or modify any existing facility.\n5. The project activity only has a renewable component of less than 15 MW.\n14\n\nVCS Project Description\nHence the choice of project category and applicable methodology is correct. Based on the\nwater and power studies carried out for grouped project and by keeping main parameters in\nview, such as, head and discharge available in the canal, the project participants declare that\nthe project would be within the limits of the small scale project activity throughout the\ncrediting period. In addition, the design parameters of turbine and generator reveal that the\nproject would be within the small scale limit throughout the crediting period."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

Type and category(ies) and technology of the small-scale project activity:\nScope Number : 1\nSectoral Scope : Energy industries (renewable - \/ non-renewable sources)\nType : I. Renewable energy projects\nCategory : AMS I.D. Grid connected renewable electricity generation\nThe project activity is a wind energy project with an installed capacity of 7.25 MW which is lesser than\n15 MW, qualifying for small scale CDM project activity. As per the provisions of Appendix B of\nSimplified Modalities and Procedures for Small Scale CDM Project Activities, approved small scale\nmethodology AMS I.D \/version 10 dated 23 December 2006, \u201cthis category comprises renewable energy\ngeneration units, such as photovoltaics, hydro, tidal\/wave, wind, geothermal, and renewable biomass, that\nsupply electricity to and\/or displace electricity from an electricity distribution system that is or would\nhave been supplied by at least one fossil fuel fired generating unit\u201d. The project activity comprises wind\nenergy supplying\/ displacing electricity from the Tamilnadu state grid, which is part of southern regional\ngrid, is being supplied by several fossil fuel generating units. With above considerations, the Type I.D. is\n\nCDM-SSC-PDD (version 02)\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board page 7\nthe most appropriate for the project activity. The project activity does not comprise any electricity\ngeneration from non-renewable energy sources.\nTechnology\nIn wind energy generation, kinetic energy of wind is converted into mechanical energy and subsequently\ninto electrical energy. Wind has considerable amount of kinetic energy when blowing at high speeds. This\nkinetic energy when passes through the blades of the WTG is converted into mechanical energy and\nrotates the wind blades. When the wind blades rotate, the connected generator also rotates, thereby\nproducing electricity.\nThe project activity has 5 WTGs each of 850 kW and 12 WTGs each of 250 kW.\nTechnology of 850 kW wind turbine generator\nThe 850 kW WTGs are of PAWT technology with Gamesa make turbines. These are an advanced version\nover conventional low capacity WTGs. The towers of these WTGs are 65 metres height. The higher\nheight gives the advantage of capturing higher power at higher height. This height also avoids disturbance\nfrom windmills located nearby. These turbines have state of art technology of variable speed and variable\npitch with a double fed generator. The \u2018aerofoil\u2019 design of the blade, especially 58 metres rotor, as against\nconventional 48-50 metres contributes to a larger swept area for energy capture. The design of the blade\nis suitable for low and medium wind conditions in plain and complex terrain, which suits the region\nwhere wind farms are located. The WTG reaches the rated capacity of 850 kW at 10.5 meters itself as\nagainst 12 metres as per power curve.\nTechnology of 250 kW wind turbine generator\nThe 250 kW WTGs installed in the project activity are of Wincon, Denmark technology and are\nmanufactured by Pioneer Wincon in India. These WTGs are of well established technology with very\nlittle maintenance. These WTGs are robust in construction and has a few moving parts as a fixed blade\nconfiguration.\nThe important parts of windmill are:\ni. Main Tower\nii. Blades\niii. Nacelle\niv. Hub\nv. Main shaft\nvi. Gearbox, bearing and housing\nvii. Brake\nviii. Generator\ni. Main Tower\n\nCDM-SSC-PDD (version 02)\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board page 8\nThis is a very tall structure of 65 metres height for 850 kW turbines and of 45 meters high for 250 kW\nturbines with a door and inside ladder at the bottom. The door is used to enter into the tower for operation\nand maintenance.\nii. Blades\nThe WTGs are provided with three blades. The blades are self supporting in nature made up of Fibre\nReinforced Polyester. The blades are mounted on the hub.\niii. Nacelle\nThe Nacelle is the one which contains all the major parts of a WTG. The nacelle is made up of thick\nrugged steel and mounted on a heavy slewing ring. Under normal operating conditions the nacelle would\nbe facing the upstream wind direction.\niv.Hub\nThe Hub is an intermediate assembly between the wing and the main shaft of the wind mill. Inside the\nhub, a system to actuate the aerodynamic brake is fitted. The hub is covered with nose cone.\nv. Main Shaft\nThe shaft is to connect the gear box and the hub. Solid high carbon steel bars or cylinders are used as\nmain shaft. The shaft is supported by two bearings.\nvi. Gear Box, Bearing and housing\nThe gearbox is used to increase the speed ratio so that the rotor speed is increased to the rated generator\nspeed. Oil cooling is employed to control the heating of the gearbox. Gearboxes are mounted over\ndampers to minimise vibration. The main bearings are placed inside housing.\nvii. Brake\nBrake is employed in the WTGs to stop the windmill mainly for maintenance check. Brakes are also\napplied during over speed conditions of the windmill. The brakes are placed on the high speed shaft.\nviii. Generator\nThe generator uses induction type of generator. The generators are provided with monitoring sensors in\neach phase winding to prevent damage to the generators.\nNot to replace the technology\nThe technology is a clean technology since there are no GHG emissions associated with the electricity\ngeneration. The project proponent hereby assures and undertakes that the installed technology would not\nbe replaced with any other or more efficient technology during the crediting period.\n\nCDM-SSC-PDD (version 02)\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board page 9"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

Output capacity of the project is 7,47 MW which is below 15 MW according to General Guidelines to\nSSC CDM methodologies v 17 EB61 Annex 21 (4.150 kVA*0,9 = 3.735 kW 7.470 kW since two Francis turbines\nwill be used). The expected technical and economic lifetime (defined as the time until first major reinvestments\nare expected to become necessary for continued operation) is 40 years guaranteed by manufacturer.1\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1 See Turbine Purchase contract\n2 Feasibility report of Tuana HEPP\nv3.1 5\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nFurther details on technical data are given in Table 3 below.\nTUANA HEPP produces GHG emission free, clean electricity, which is fed into the national Turkish grid. All\nTurkish power plants are connected to this grid and are dispatched centrally by the Turkish grid operator T\u00fcrkiye\nElektrik \u0130letim A.\u015e (TE\u0130A\u015e) and its Market Financial Settlement Centre (Turkish: Piyasa Mali Uzlastirma Merkezi;\nPMUM). The electricity supplied to the national grid is dominated by thermal power plants; see Table 5 in\nSection 1.10 below. As TUANA HEPP is a run-of-river HPP, the electricity amount supplied to the grid depends\non external physical conditions, i.e. the flow rate at \u00c7iftlik creek, and cannot be regulated. In contrast, the\nthermal power plants connected to the national grid can be regulated. Concluding, the electricity produced by\nTUANA HEPP displaces power generation by thermal power plants, which leads to savings in fuel combustion\nand thus to the reduction of GHG emissions, as specified and explained in detail in Section 3 below.\nA\u015fkale A.\u015e. operates the HEPP as Independent Power Producer (IPP) and has obtained the respective\nproduction license from the Turkish Energy Market Regulatory Authority (Turkish: Enerji Piyasas\u0131 D\u00fczenleme\nKurumu, EPDK) in 26\/07\/2012.\nFigure 1. Basic Single Line Diagram\nv3.1 6\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nFigure 2. Main Single Line Diagram\nContribution to sustainable development\nBuilding a HEPP contributes to a sustainable expansion path of the Turkish energy system, as it serves the\nsteadily growing electricity demand in an environmentally suitable way. The project also contributes to\ndissemination of state-of-the-art new renewable energy (REN) technology, thus increasing the use of\necologically sound domestic energy sources in Turkish electricity supply.\nNo significant negative ecological impacts can be expected from the proposed project activity. The project's\necological impact has been assessed by preparing first a project presentation file (Turkish: Proje Tan\u0131t\u0131m\nDosyas\u0131, PTD). The PTD was finalized and submitted to the Erzurum province office of Turkish Ministry of\nEnvironment and Forestry (Turkish: T\u00fcrkiye Cumhuriyeti \u00c7evre ve Orman Bakanl\u0131\u011f\u0131, T\u00c7OB). T\u00c7OB has\ndecided to release the project from the duty to perform a full environmental impact assessment (EIA) according\nto Turkish law in 01\/10\/2012. A summary of the PTD and evidence for the T\u00c7OB decision are presented in\nSection 5 below.\nIn fact, there are essential positive environmental effects, as highly polluting electricity generation technologies\nare displaced by the project. Pollution not only comprises greenhouse gases but other local air pollutants such\nas SO , NO , or Particulate Matter, as well. x x\nAs for social impacts, significant positive employment effects will be occurred especially during the construction\nand installation period, where more than 50 people have been working for the project. It is aimed to employ local\npeople to add social impact to the project. For local workers, an employment of one year means a stable\nincorme. Moreover, local companies benefit from the project, as construction services and material are mainly\nsourced from local suppliers. Management, operation and maintenance of the HEPP create permanent jobs\nwhich require high qualification, contributing to capacity building and know-how dissemination in Turkey.\nv3.1 7\n\n[['Type: Uncontrolled frontal reception with concrete weight', None, None, None, None], ['Crest Elevation: 1.885,50 m', 'River Bed Elevation: 1.874', None, 'Normal water level: 1.884 m', None], ['Spillway', None, None, None, None], ['Total Width: 40 m', None, 'Project flow rate (Q100): 104,1 m3\/s', None, None], ['Nap Elevation: 1.885,5 m', None, 'Bottom Elevation: 1.874 m', None, None], ['Energy Structures', None, None, None, None], ['Gross fell: 130 m', None, 'Net fell: 120,4', None, None], ['Project Flow rate: 7 m3\/s', None, 'Firm energy prod. : 1,09 Gwh', None, None], ['Secondary Energy prod. : 13,95 Gwh', None, 'Annual energy prod. : 14,03 Gwh', None, None], ['Transfer Tunnel', None, None, None, None], ['Type: Spiral bundled PVC pipe', None, 'Total Length: 5.490 m', None, None], ['Capacity: 7,00 m3\/s', None, 'Diameter: 2,3 m', None, None], ['Forebay', None, None, None, None], ['Location: End of conveyance', None, 'Type: Troll type, reinforced concrete', None, None], ['Width \u00b7 length: 10 m* 70,95 m', None, 'Depth: 5,7 m', None, None], ['Penstock', None, None, None, None], ['Location: See Table 4 in Section 1.9 below', None, 'Type: Open, steel pipe', None, None], ['Length: 747 m', 'Diameter: 1,5 m', None, 'Wall thickness: 11 mm', None], ['Turbine', None, None, None, None], ['Type: Horizontal Axis Francis', 'Number of units: 2', None, 'Power of unit: 3.830 kW', None], ['Total Power: 7,66 MW (7,39 MW )\\nm e', 'Net head: 120,4 m', None, 'Project flow rate: 7 m3\/s', None], ['Turbine specific speed: 1000 rpm', None, 'Annual Power Generation: 14,03 GWh', None, None], ['Generator', None, None, None, None], ['Number of units: 2', 'Unit Power: 4.150 kVA', None, 'Power Factor: 0,90', None], ['Nominal Strain: 6,3 kV', 'Frequency: 50 Hertz', None, 'Efficiency: 0,90', None], ['Unit Transformer', None, None, None, None], ['Type: External Type, 3 phase oil isolated', None, 'Cooling Form: Onan', None, None], ['Number of units: 2', 'Power of unit: 45.500 kVA', None, 'Frequency: 50 Hz', None], ['Internal Requirement Transformer', None, None, None, None], ['Cooling Form: Onan', 'Number of units: 1', None, 'Power of unit: 100 kVA', None], ['Frequency: 50 Hz', 'Connection: Dzn5', None, '', None], ['Emergency Generator', None, None, None, None], ['Number of units: 1', 'Type: 4 stroke vertical cylinders', None, None, 'Frequency: 50 Hz'], ['Power of unit: 100 kVA', 'Frequency: 50 Hz', None, None, 'Power Factor: 0,80'], ['RPM: 1.500 rpm', 'Cooling Form: Closed circuit\\nwater cooling', None, None, '']]\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nTable 3.

In the process, an equivalent quantum of electricity that\nwould have been generated by the grid in line with the grid electricity generation mix\nis displaced by the project activity. The carbon intensity of the fossil-fuel dominated\ngeneration mix of the grid is evident from the following break-up of various types of\nenergy sources constituting the grid-mix contributing electricity to the Southern Grid\nsystem.\nTable 7: Power Generation mix of southern regional grid of India\nSourc : Central Electricity authority10 as on 31\/01\/2009\n*From Wind Energy Sources as on 30\/09\/200811\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n2. \u201cIf the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a\nwind\/diesel unit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small-scale CDM project activity\napplies only to the renewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel, the\ncapacity of the entire unit shall not exceed the limit of 15MW\u201d.\nThe project activity involves only wind power generation. The gross wind power\ngeneration capacity of the bundled project activity is 7.5 MW, which is less than 15\nMW, as stipulated in the applicability criterion under consideration.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n3. \u201cCombined heat and power (co-generation) systems are not eligible under\nthis category\u201d\nThe project activity involves generation of electricity only through WTGs and is not a\nco-generation system.\n9Refer to: The Southern Regional Electricity Grid of India is primarily constituted of fossil- fuel fired thermal power\nplants. Refer to CO Baseline Database Version 4.0 Dated October 2008 available at 2\nhttp:\/\/www.cea.nic.in\/planning\/c%20and%20e\/Government%20of%20India%20website.htm\n10 Refer to: http:\/\/www.cea.nic.in\/power_sec_reports\/Executive_Summary\/2009_01\/27-33.pdf\n11 Refer to: http:\/\/www.cwet.tn.nic.in\/html\/information_isw.html\n21\n\nVCS Project Description\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n4. \u201cIn the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy\ngeneration units at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added\ncapacity of the units added by the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be\nphysically distinct from the existing units.\u201d\nThe project activity does not involve the addition of renewable energy generation\nunits at an existing renewable power generation facility.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n5. \u201cProject activities that seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for\nrenewable energy generation are included in this category. To qualify as a small\nscale project, the total output of the modified or retrofitted unit shall not exceed the\nlimit of 15 MW\u201d\nThe renewable energy generating wind-farms employed by the project activity are\nnewly constructed set up and does not involve retrofitting or modification of any\nexisting facility for renewable energy generation.\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\nThus, the project activity fulfills all the applicability criteria of the simplified small scale\nmethodology AMS-I.D.\/ Version 1412."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

The region where \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 has\ndeveloped its project is particularly affected by a lack of development. Rural poverty has caused the\ninternal migration from rural towns to precarious urban settlements in Montevideo and other cities,\nincreasing marginality, criminality, lack of education, drug-addiction and other social problems. The\nregion around the project site has a dominance of an extensive livestock system of production, which is\ncharacterized with a very low productivity level, very low employment, and precarious working conditions\nand reduced opportunities for women and youth, among other problems. \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 forest activity is\nexpected to increase the gross value of production per unit area of land by six to eight folds, besides\npromoting a number of new activities which will multiply this impact.\n27\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nCreation of employment is one of the main social benefits of the project. Typically, an extensive livestock\nproduction system employs 1.4 to 4.4 persons every 1,000 ha. \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 project is expected to multiply\nthat figure by 8 to 10 times.\nBeyond an increased number of jobs, the project is expected to contribute to the development of the\nregion and the country pursuant the priorities defined by Uruguayan government (promotion of small\nfamily businesses, increase in exports, eradication of rural poverty, incorporation of technology,\nincreased nationally added value, development of new productive chains and geographic\ndecentralization of development) as follows:\no Promotion of small family businesses\nAs it was mentioned above, \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 project activity will generate several job opportunities, creating\nmore jobs than in the baseline scenario. The vast majority of employees will be hired by contractors. The\nmajority of the outsourced contractor companies currently working with \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019, are registered in\nUruguay as \u201cPYMES\u201d (small and medium sized companies), mostly family companies.\no Internationally tradable products\nThe entire production of \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 project (wood, meat and carbon credits) will have the international\nmarket as the final destination.\no Eradication of rural poverty\nThe main contribution of \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 project activity to the eradication of rural poverty will be through the\ngeneration of high quality and stable employment, in a region of Uruguay with elevated levels of poverty.\nA study by Car\u00e1mbula and Pi\u00f1eiro (2006) , demonstrate that forestry projects oriented to the production\nof high value timber, generates high positive impacts in the eradication of poverty in rural areas and\nreverting the process of internal migration to big cities.\no Incorporation of technology\nThe project incorporates the best available and affordable technology for optimizing wood productivity\nand quality through the selection of seeds, site preparation, plantation, weed and pest control, forest\nmanagement and wood harvesting and logistics, and achieving sustainability objectives. \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 has\na program for applied research, continuously testing various practices in order to achieve continuous\nimprovement over time, and collaborates with other companies and public institutions in this regard.\no Increased nationally added value to forestry products\n\u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 project will produce timber that can be used for high-value products. As discussed above,\ncurrently there are no wood industries located within a reachable distance from the project site. However,\nthe presence of \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 and of other similar initiatives in the area which have already secured or are\nalso seeking carbon finance may induce in the future the establishment of industries in the region. And\neven in the case that no industries are developed, the saw logs and veneer logs produced by \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019\ncould be exported through Montevideo harbour at prices which will be higher than those that could be\nobtained by selling pulpwood, which is the traditional wood product exported from Uruguay.\n28\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nIn addition, the forest management adopted by \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 increase the amount of carbon sequestered\nby trees, thus increasing the carbon embedded value in wood products.\no Development of new productive chains\n\u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 has no plans to not invest in the industry sector. Nevertheless, as mentioned above,\n\u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 forest plantation may contribute to promote the establishment of industrial investments in\nthe area.\no Geographic decentralization of development\nAs it was mentioned above, \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 project will bring about a number of socio-economic benefits that\nwill mostly impact on its surrounding area, which is currently one of the less developed ones in the\ncountry. This would create a development pole away from Montevideo and other areas which concentrate\nmost of the economic activity in the country.\n29\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\n2 SAFEGUARDS\n2.1 No Net Harm\nPotential negative environmental and steps taken to mitigate them\nAll the net area submitted for environmental approval to the national environmental authority have been\nclassified as category A. Therefore, their negative environmental impacts are considered non-significant\nby the national regulations and thus, environmental impact assessments are not required by the\nenvironmental authority.\nAs above mentioned, the forest management system are following the \u201cBest Forest Practices Manual\u201d\nand \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 forests will be FSC certified in the near future, ensuring sustainable forest management\nAs part of its forest management system, the management plan includes a chapter that describes the\nenvironmental and socio-economic aspects of the project.\nAdditionally, \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 has in place an environmental impact management plan and a monitoring\nsystem.\nThe system complies with all FSC criteria established under the environmental values and impacts\nprinciple. Below is a summary of the comments on compliance with the established criteria\n\u2022 Environmental impacts assessment: Pike Consultora Forestal systematically evaluates the\npotential environmental impacts of all activities, including activities involving in situ processing,\nas it is presented in the Management Plan. Also, they stipulate mitigation measures for significant\nimpacts. Pike Consultora Forestal conducts regular inspections to the lands to collect findings.\nThe lands supervisors record non-conformities and send them to Pike Consultora Forestal\nheadquarters for processing.\n\u2022 Protection of rare species and threatened species and their habitats: the protection activities and\nconservation management are documented in the Management Plan and detailed in the\ncartography. The \"Natural Resource Management\" chapter of the management plan evidences\nthat studies of flora and fauna are carried out by external experts to know about the natural\nresources in certified \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 lands. Within the same chapter are established the areas to\nprotect or preserve. Additionally, hunting is prohibited in all \u2018Bugnavilla\u2019 lands and native forest\nare not altered.\n\u2022 Maintenance of functions and ecological values: there are detailed wildlife surveys, conducted\nby external experts that characterize the different existing ecosystems. There is a list of the\nexistent and potential species in the lands according to their conservation status. The silvicultural\nsystems applied to artificial plantations meet the production targets and are similar to those of\nother companies in the area and approved by the competent authorities. No degraded areas that\ncould require the implementation of restoration plans were identified.\n30\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\n\u2022 Protection of representative samples of existing ecosystems: the project preserves areas of\nnative forest, natural grassland with rocky outcrops and low meadows. These areas are mapped\nand identified and well known by the land\u2019s workers."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_country': 'Uruguay'}"}]}

The\nassociated project implementer is helping farmers to plant trees on the land which is identified as\nunproductive, and the area is highly water scarce. Farmers retain ownership of the trees,\nproducts, and land as well. Farmers received training from the project implementer for plantation\nand the project implementer (Greenovation) is providing plantation material (saplings, manure) to\nthe farmers and further assistance in maintaining the required survival rate of the plantation.\nCarbon credits generated from this project will help in maintaining the survival rate of planted\ntrees and support farmers. The total area expected to be covered in the project is around 10,000\nhectares. The current plantations have been covered to plant 4,400 hectares in the country.\nThe project implementer is Greenovation empowering the large group of farmers in India by\nmanaging and planting the less productive land to increase forest cover by establishing the forest.\nproject implementer helps in managing and planting Agroforestry species (Refer to the table:1) to\npromote the additional income from NTFPs (Non-Timber Forest Products) and fruits production\nfor participating farmers. Carbon credit sales will generate income and provide project funding to\naddress agricultural, nutritional and fuel challenges arising among the communities. Further, as\nthe project implementer will expand to more groups and more areas, it ensures more trees, more\nbiodiversity, and more climate change benefits with more income for local people. The carbon\ncredits from this project activity will also create a new \u2018virtual\u2019 cash crop for the participants, who\ngain all the direct benefits of growing trees and receive benefits based on the GHG benefits\ncreated by their efforts (as a result-based payment approach). The maturing trees and\nConservation Farming will provide additional sustainable benefits such as Climate change\nmitigation and carbon sequestration, watershed management, soil improvement and biodiversity\nrichness. The project activity includes improved knowledge, an improved environment, and\nmarketable commodities such as fruits, nuts, honey and other NTFPs. The project zone will be\nknown for a very healthy wild population of flora and fauna and create a forest to provide suitable\nhabitat for multiple birds and other native species. The project will also mitigate the human-wildlife\nconflict by conserving more and more natural resources and decreasing the dependency on the\nnative forest to fulfil the resource requirement. project implementer is supporting as an\nadministrative backbone that supplies training in building nurseries, tree planting, Conservation\nFarming, and exchange of technical knowledge. Project implementer is available to everyone,\nand all are considered equal. The rotating leadership and the Small Group rules, empower\nwomen and undereducated people. Those who will be the most successful, regardless of\neducation levels or gender, become mentors and leaders. This project seeks to maximize\nenvironmental and social impact while supporting and improving existing activities. Planting trees\non community-owned land in conjunction with agricultural activities is minimally disruptive, which\nresults in virtually no leakage or baseline emission.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 9\n\n[['Species', 'Botanical name', 'Included'], ['Mango', 'Mangifera indica', 'Yes'], ['Guava', 'Pisidium gujava', 'Yes'], ['Litchi', 'Juglans regia', 'Yes'], ['Amla', 'Phyllanthus emblica', 'Yes'], ['Reetha', 'Sapindusmukurosi', 'Yes'], ['Neem', 'Azaridacta indica', 'Yes'], ['Tamarind', 'Tamarindus indica', 'Yes'], ['Jamun', 'Syzigiumcumini', 'Yes'], ['Cashew', 'Anacardium occidentale', 'Yes'], ['Coconut', 'Cocusnicifera', 'Yes'], ['Custard apple', 'Annona squamosa', 'Yes'], ['Apricot', 'Prunus armeniaca', 'Yes'], ['Apple', 'Malus domestica', 'Yes'], ['Fig', 'Ficus Carica', 'Yes']]\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nThe project description is a subset for an ongoing project in India (latitudes 8\u00b04'N and 37\u00b06'N and\nlongitudes 68\u00b07'E and 97\u00b025'E).

As per methodology\nrequirements, following are the important and potential areas that result in leakage.\n1. Application of manure from outside the project area\nIn this grouped project all the manure application activities use manure produced on-site i.e., within the\nproject area. If at all, the manure is sourced from other places (outside the project area), it will be reported\nand accounted for leakage, and a deduction will be applied as per methodological requirements.\n2. Leakage from Livestock displacement\nThere is no such activity which displaces livestock from the project area in the proposed grouped project.\nRather, the project promotes better and sustainable livestock management practices.\n3. Decrease in productivity.\nAs per the methodology requirements, to ensure leakage is not occurring due to decline in crop\nproductivity, Boomitra proposes to conduct a detailed study on crop productivity every 10 years. If there\nis productivity decline by more than 5% due to any factor (reduced fertiliser application), the combination\nwhich is leading to leakage will be stratified and will be removed from crediting.\nInstance 01\nThere are no direct or indirect leakages expected from this project activity. The proposed activity is\ncompletely in-situ in nature, which does not contribute to indirect leakages or new emissions elsewhere.\nAs clearly described in the project activity description section of the PDD, the activity proposed is purely\nto bring a behavioral change in the practices followed in the baseline. The project scenario does not\ninvolve any such activity that leads to new emissions elsewhere. However, project activities may include\nactivities like application of manure which is produced on-site i.e., within the project area. If at all, the\nmanure is sourced from other places (outside the project area), it will be reported and accounted for\nleakage, and a deduction will be applied as per methodological requirements. There is no such activity\nwhich displaces livestock from the project area in the proposed grouped project. Rather, the project\npromotes better and sustainable livestock management practices.\nDuring the verification, a detailed analysis will be provided on yields and productivity of the crops included\nin the first instance 01.\nCommercially Sensitive Information\nAll information contained in this grouped description document is not confidential and is available for\nstakeholders. However, information about commercials involved in project development, implementation\nand some of the procedures may include commercially sensitive information because of the company\u2019s\nbusiness activity.\n47\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\nFull information on internal procedures were shared with the VVB for auditing purposes, who can testify\nthat all relevant information is present under this Project Description.\nFurther Information\nThere are no additional relevant legislative, technical, economic, sectoral, social, environmental,\ngeographic, site-specific and\/or temporal information that may have a bearing on the eligibility of the\ngrouped project, the net GHG emission reductions or removals, or the quantification of the project\u2019s net\nGHG emission reductions or removals.\n2 SAFEGUARDS\n2.1 No Net Harm\nSafeguards are measures and methods that can help to ensure that proposed AFOLU activities do no\nharm to communities or the environment in any way, mitigate the risk of adverse environmental and social\nimpacts of AFLOU activities and promote benefits beyond carbon emission reductions. It is regularly used\nin reference to policies or procedures intended to avoid adverse outcomes of actions or programs. The\nresults outcomes from of the stakeholder consultations and the experiences from the project\nimplementation were evaluated to assess potential negative impacts from the project activities.\nThere are no potential negative environmental impacts foreseen for this grouped project. However, initial\nyears of project implementation farmers may see a drop in crop yields due to project activities involving\nreduced synthetic fertilizer use, adopting to new organic manure management practices, etc. All the\nproject activities will ultimately lead to improvement of soil fertility. Increase in soil fertility means\nincrease in crop yields and decrease in overall expenses.\nAll the information pertaining to Section 2.1 is proved at a grouped level. Hence, it is not applicable for\nnew project instances.\nAs discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.5 of this PDD, continuous and open communication channels were\nestablished in order to prevent and mitigate any potential previously unidentified negative impacts."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

Social well-being:\nThe main source for electricity generation for this power plant will be locally available agriculture\nwaste\/ woody biomass. The economy of the local people will be improved by selling biomass to\nthe power plant.

Economic well-being:\nThe biomass gasification process is an alternative to fossil fuel based power plants and the\ndecentralized power generation through biomass gasification will reduce the transmission and\ndistribution losses. The project shall create new rural income resulting from the sales of biomass\nfuel like agriculture waste\/ woody biomass. Increased income levels shall contribute to the\neconomic safety and empowerment of the most vulnerable sections of local society.\n3. Environmental well-being:\nThe project is using biomass for power generation. There is no net GHG emission from this\nproject activity. Combustion of biomass in the proposed project does not result in net increase in\nGHG emissions of CO . In the absence of the project activity the biomass would have been 2\ndecayed in the land and would emit CH . Hence, the project activity is also reducing CH 4 4\nemission in the atmosphere.\nThus, the project causes no negative impact on the surrounding environment contributing to\nenvironmental well-being.\n4. Technological well-being:\nThe project makes use of efficient environmentally safe biomass gasification technology for\npower generation with no Green House Gas (GHG) emission. The recent development in the gas\ncooling and cleaning system provides dry producer gas with the tar and particulate level at an\nacceptable range.\nThe generation of electricity from the project leads to strengthening of the grid, increasing the\nenergy availability thereby meeting the energy demand to a certain extent leading to\ntechnological well-being.\nIn view of the above, the PP has considered that the project activity profoundly contributes to the\nsustainable development.\n2 APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY\n2.1 Title and Reference of Methodology\nTitle: Type-I, Renewable Energy Project\nMethodology: AMS I.D.

In conclusion, the construction work of this proposed project is not\nexpected to affect the local ecological environment.\nGiven the environment of the project location, there is very little wildlife at the site, and no protected\nspecies has been detected. Therefore, there is no significant impact by the Project on the local ecology.\nD.2.

By introducing sustainable grazing measures and managing the plants properly,\nthis project is expected to increase local carbon sequestration and contribute to the development\nof the local ecosystem.\nThis project locates in Siziwang Banner13, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China.\nSiziwang Banner is a productive area that lies at the northwest corner of Ulanqab city, bordering\nMongolia's Dornogovi Province to the northwest. Lying along the northern foothills of the Yin\nMountains, the banner has an average elevation of 1,400 meters (4,600 ft), which enables mild\nand seasonal wind and rain. According to the local government, the climate of Siziwang Banner is\na typical temperate monsoon continental climate. Most of the banner's area is grassland.\nThis project covers the entire grassland area of Siziwang Banner, including 13 minor\nadministrative districts under the jurisdiction of the banner. According to our Baseline Survey,\nbefore the implementation of the project, the grassland in the project zone has been facing\nserious degradation and desertification due to the impact of both climate change and human\nactivities. Continuous dryness caused by global warming and unregulated grazing in the local\narea has accelerated the degradation and desertification in recent decades. According to the\nNational Standard Documents of the People's Republic of China14, the grasslands should be\nregarded as seriously degraded if the total forage yield decreased by 50% compared to the yield\nbefore degradation, while as moderately degraded if the total forage yield decreased between\n21% to 50%. Nearly half of the grasslands in the project zone are seriously degraded, as per our\nBaseline Survey, while others are also facing a rising risk of serious degradation. In order to\nmitigate and reverse the degradation, this project anticipates a scientific management of\n1966396.34 ha of degraded grassland in total through three main restoration measures:\n1\uff09 Rotational Grazing\nRotational grazing requires that the grazing time shall be halved by dividing grasslands into\nseasonal grazing land according to their livestock carrying capacity. Then based on specified\ngrazing order, grazing cycle and zoning grazing time, the grassland is grazed area by area\nand used in turn. 803,323 ha of degraded grassland shall be managed scientifically by\nrotational grazing.\n2) Rest Grazing\n13 \u201cBanner\u201d is a county-level administrative division in Inner Mongolia Autonomous District, China.\n14 GB19377-2003 Parameters for Degradation, Sandification and Salification of Rangelands.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 8\n\nCCB + VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nUsually, there are two main measures to rest grazing. Firstly, to establish protecting districts\nby building fences or setting up visible signs, and secondly, to stop grazing in a particular\nperiod annually. Before 2019, the former one has already been conducted by the proponents\nand local government agencies (see Section 3.3.3) in seriously degraded grassland and has\nrestored more than 60,000 ha of degraded grassland by building fences, but their efforts were\nnot scientifically recorded due to the lack of proper technology. This project plans to restore\nanother 1,163,073.33 ha of degraded grassland by conducting the same measure, with the\nscientific technology provided by the proponent Hefei Qingyan Technology Co., Ltd.\nRest grazing requires that grazing shall not be carried out within 45 days between April and\nMay each year, during the re-greening period of the spring growth of the grass. 803,323 ha of\ndegraded grassland shall be managed scientifically by the implementation of rest grazing.\n3) Grassland Reseeding\nGrassland Reseeding refers to sowing grass seeds of local high-quality forage such as\nElymus dahuricus Turcz. (Dahurian wildrye), Medicago L. (Medick), Aneurolepidium\nchinense(Trin)Kitag. (Leymus Chinensis), Elymus sibiricus Linn. (Siberian wildrye), Melilotus\nofficinalis (L.) Pall. (Sweet yellow clover or Yellow melilot), Agropyron cristatum(L.) Beauv.\n(Crested wheatgrass). Stipa Krylovii Roshev. (Krylov Needlegrass), Elymus Sibiricus L.\n(Barley grass), Poa pratensis L. (Bluegrass), and Agropyron cristatum L. (Ice grass). In this\nproject, 33,126.67 ha of degraded grassland shall be managed scientifically by grassland\nreseeding.\nIn practice, these measures shall not be conducted separately in the project area. For instance,\ngrass seeds shall mainly be sown in the areas where the fences are built, in order to spare time\nand space for their early growth. Meanwhile, rotating grazing and rest grazing may be conducted\nin sequence in the same area, which includes most of the local pastures. Totally, 1,966,396.34 ha\nof degraded grassland has been managed scientifically, with at least one of the three measures\nconducted on each hectare of the project area. In this case, it is not appropriate to estimate the\neffect of each measure separately.\nThis project also alleviates soil desertification and restores grassland vegetation to improve soil\ncarbon storage and local biodiversity through grassland management measures from other\nprotecting projects, like rodent and pest control, to ensure the long-term sustainable management\nof the project area.\nTrees are planted by one of the project proponents, Inner Mongolia Tanhuilvneng Environmental\nProtection Technology Co., Ltd., during the implementation of the project. However, it may take 5-\n10 years for those trees to become productive. They are counted in the carbon pools in Section"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_state_province': 'Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region', 'project_country': 'China'}"}]}

The\nMATANI REDD+ Project is located in the Department of Vaupes, corresponding to the Amazon\nbiome of Colombia.\nThe departmental territory corresponds to the hot thermal floor according to the Koeppen\nclassification, the Vaup\u00e9s region corresponds to the equatorial climate that is always humid,\ncharacterized by constant precipitation throughout the year, the lack of a truly dry period and an\naverage relative humidity of 84% with variations of more or less than 5% (PGAR, 2011). The\ndepartment is characterized by being a transition sector between the dry plains of the Orinoquia,\nto the north, and the humid Amazon jungle. Precipitation presents a bimodal behavior,\ndecreasing from January to February and from July to August. The existence of these two less\nrainy periods is due to the influence of the northeast and southeast trade winds, which reach\nEcuador in those months of the year. Average annual rainfall is around 3,254 mm (CDA, 2011).\nThe average annual temperature is 26\u00b0C, with the period between October and April having the\nhighest temperature and the lowest between May and September. The average solar brightness\nper month is 104.55 hours\/month and the highest is 135.7 hours\/month; the annual average\n\nis 1,255 hours\/year. The periods of greatest solar brightness coincide with those of least\nprecipitation and highest temperature, which are the first six months of the year (PGAR, 2011).\n(Secretariat of Planning and Development, 2020) (SINCHI 2019 Colombia BIO).\nClimate\nThe climatic conditions of the department of Vaup\u00e9s are typical of the transition zone between\nthe plains of the Orinoqu\u00eda and the jungles of the Amazon; Due to the conformation of the\ntopography of the area, it only presents the warm thermal floor, with temperatures that oscillate\nbetween 27 and 30\u00b0 C, depending on the time of year. In the southern part of the departmental\nterritory, the rains are abundant, exceeding 3,000 millimeters per year. (Secretariat of Planning\nand Development, 2020) (SINCHI 2019 Colombia BIO).\nGeomorphology\nThe Soils the Vaup\u00e9s region is part of the Guayanas massif, a formation from the Precambrian\nera and the Paleozoic formation of Araracuara. This region is the relict of great mountains\ndestroyed by tectonic action over millions of years, of which only small isolated mountain ranges\n300 to 500 m high remain. Five geological units are recognized: the Mit\u00fa magmatic complex;\nthe Pir\u00e1-Paran\u00e1 formation; the Araracuara formation; the Amazonian upper Tertiary age\nsediments and the Quaternary age deposits (CDA). (Secretariat of Planning and Development,\n2020)\nIn general, the territories of the department are made up of tertiary sedimentary plains,\nstructural and residual plains, with the presence of some sectors where there is a hilly landscape\nmade up of mountain ranges, hills and structural plateaus, giving rise to a succession of hills of\ndifferent elevation levels; In them, the Cubiy\u00fa and Carur\u00fa mesas, the Camanaos, Jap\u00edn, Omudo\nand Tipiaca hills, among others, stand out as orographic accidents (CDA, 2011). (Secretariat of\nPlanning and Development, 2020)\nIn general, they are soils of low fertility, few depths with very low saturation of bases, acids and\nlow to high content of organic matter, depending on the position in the relief, but of little\nmineralization, the soils are susceptible to erosive processes, given the little evolution of the\nsame, the low depth, the climatic conditions to which they are subjected to high rainfall, high\nhumidity, and high solar radiation, which make the environment limited to advance intensive\nagroindustrial programs (CDA, 2011). (Secretariat of Planning and Development, 2020)\nHydrography\nVaup\u00e9s hydrographically does not constitute a single unit, its main rivers belong to the\nhydrographic zone of the Amazon, with the exception of the Papunagua rivers that belong to the\n\nhydrographic zone of the Orinoco; macro basins that finally discharge their waters towards the\nAtlantic Sea. The Papunagua River pours its waters into the In\u00edrida, the latter into the Guaviare,\nforming part of the Orinoco macro-basin; On the other hand, there are the Isana, Vaup\u00e9s, Tiqui\u00e9,\nTaraira and Apaporis rivers that belong to the Amazon macro-basin (CDA, 2011). (Secretariat of\nPlanning and Development, 2020)\nThe Vaup\u00e9s River formed by the confluence of the Unilla and Itilla rivers in the Guaviare, gives\nits name to the department, crosses the territory in a west-east direction; This basin has an\napproximate area of 37,748 km2 and a total length of approximately 1,000 kilometers. Its most\nimportant tributaries, upstream from the Yavarate Community (border with Brazil) are the Papur\u00ed,\nQuerar\u00ed, Cuduyar\u00ed, Ca\u00f1o Sangre, Ca\u00f1o Y\u00ed, Aviy\u00fa, Ti, Carur\u00fa, Arara and Bacat\u00ed rivers. It has\napproximatel y 70 streams or cachiveras7 along its route, among which the following stand\nout: Yurupar\u00ed (located near the border of Carur\u00fa and Mit\u00fa), Tat\u00fa, Wacurab\u00e1, Santa Cruz, Tayaz\u00fa,\nVilla F\u00e1tima, Nan\u00e1, Macuc\u00fa (municipality of Mit\u00fa ), Danta, Matap\u00ed, Cemetery, Carur\u00fa, among\nothers (in the village of Yavarat\u00e9). The Vaup\u00e9s River belongs to the Negro River basin, which\ndischarges its waters into the Amazon in Brazilian territory. The flow of the river depends on the\nseason, its level can change up to 10 meters, according to considerations of surface runoff; an\naverage flow in Mit\u00fa of 1,294.2 m3 \/s is reported (CDA, 2011). (Secretariat of Planning and\nDevelopment, 2020)\nFor its part, the Apaporis River receives water from the Taraira River, Pir\u00e1 River, Cananar\u00ed; The\nTaraira Lagoon, also known as Lake Capar\u00fa or Mosiro Itajura, is part of this basin, with an\napproximate water mirror area of 1,000 hectares, storing a volume of 27 x 106 m3 of water,\nwhich is why it is located in the placed twelve (12) in the list of the twenty (20) largest freshwater\nreserves in Colombia9. Along its route are the Vedo, Libertad, Playa, and Jirijirimo streams,\namong others. The latter known not only for its beauty, but for being one of the largest in the\ndepartment and for being a sacred site of high cultural significance for the indigenous peoples\nof the region. Like the Vaup\u00e9s river, its behavior varies according to the runoff at each time of\nthe year; this river reports an average flow of 2,700 m3\/s (CDA, 2011). (Secretariat of Planning\nand Development, 2020)\nThese rivers are characterized by being the main means of communication between the\ncommunities of the Department. However, the constant presence of cachiveras limits its\nnavigability for large vessels; in many sectors the boat must be dragged or transferred due to the\nimpossibility of crossing these cachiveras; This situation, coupled with the lack of land\ncommunication routes, places the department in critical isolation conditions that hinder\nconnectivity both within it and towards the interior of the country, neighboring departments or\nthe bordering country (CDA, 2011). (Secretariat of Planning and Development, 2020)\nFlora and fauna\nThe flora of the Department is distributed in its forests or jungles; the vegetation according to\nthe geographical and ecological characteristics, corresponds to a formation of Tropical Humid\nForest (Bh-T), according to the Holdridge classification..

Therefore the Project activities comply with national and local regulations\nlike the Forest Code and the Constitution of 1988.\nConclusion: The Consistency Analysis shows that all three scenarios are in compliance with\nmandatory legislation and regulations taking into account their enforcement in the region. In the case of\nunplanned logging that is an agent that precedes deforestation by ranchers, it has been proven that there\nis lack of enforcement is widely spread not only in Portel but also in Para.\n2.5.2 STEP 2: Investment analysis to determine that the proposed Project\nactivity is not the most economically or financially attractive of the\nidentified land-use scenarios\nThe simple cost analysis is basically a Project cost description along the crediting period. It aims to\ndemonstrate all the costs associated to development and implementation of the Project. When Projects\nhave no other revenue but the carbon credits, it is allowed to use this financial analysis\n104\n\nDue to the fact that the Project is a conservation Project with no other sources of income besides carbon\nrevenues, a simple cost analysis (Annex 1) will be applied to prove additionality. Given that carbon credit\nrevenue is the only source of financing for this Project, without this source (or the future expectation of\ncarbon finance) no AUD activities could be implemented and BaU baseline scenarios would take place in\nthe Project Area.\nSince the beginning of the Project, the AUD activities were envisioned to be feasible only if carbon credits\nrevenue would be available. This is made evident by the documents presented (Annex 1). Furthermore,\ninitial financing for the Project, received exclusively from private investors will cover 100% of the Project\u2019s\ncosts over the first years. Again, this is a clear indication that without carbon finance Project activities\ncannot be undertaken and therefore are additional.\nIn conclusion it is demonstrated that a large amount of initial capital is required for the set-up of the\nProject.

This section will present highlights of the process.\n3.1 Baseline Emissions\n3.1.1 Selection of the baseline approach\nFor the projection of future deforestation in the baseline scenario, approach \u201cA\u201d of the VM0015\nmethodology was selected, given that the rate of baseline deforestation is assumed to be a continuation\nof the average annual rate measured during the historical reference period (1996-2008) within the\nreference region. The past observed deforestation rate is calculated by comparing the area under forest\ncover in satellite imagery classifications for the reference region at two different times.\nAccording to the VM0015 methodology, the annual rate of forest change must be calculated as follows:\nWhere:\nRBSLRR = Deforestation rate within the reference region (Puyravaud, 2003) t\nARR = Area with forest cover at year 1996 (ha) = 1,853,595.1 ha t1\nARR = Area with forest cover at year 2008 (ha) = 1,508,804.0 ha t2\nt1= Start date of the historical reference period (year=1996)\nt2= End date of the historical reference period (year=2008)\nRBSLRR = -1.70 % t\nThen, a Similarity-Weighted Instance-based Machine Learning algorithm with a Markov chain model\nbased on the past observed deforestation rate is performed to predict areas vulnerable to forest changes\nusing multi-temporal remote sensing data.\n107"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}"}]}

The project is being developed with the blessings of the Institut Congolais Pour\nla Conservation de la Nature (Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation, ICCN), which is the government\npartner responsible for the upkeep and conservation of the National parks and reserves in the country. The\nother major stakeholders are the local communities of Kinlau and Malela. The two communities live around\nthe protected mangrove area (PMM), a resource they depend on for various ecosystem goods and services.\nMangrove forests are biodiversity hotspots that offer key ecosystem functioning roles including coastal\nprotection, climate change adaptation, climate mitigation, biodiversity support and provision of forest\nproducts for the local communities13. Critical among the forest services and products drawn from the forest\nby the local communities, living adjacent to the forest, include wood for construction, firewood, fish, and\nhoney. Additionally, mangroves sequester up to five times the amounts of carbon from the atmosphere\ncompared to tropical upland forest, making it one of the most carbon-rich ecosystems of the world.14 Thus,\nmaking carbon storage by the mangroves crucial in counterbalancing anthropogenic CO2 emissions and\nmitigating climate change.\nDespite its uniqueness and diverse uses, degradation of mangrove forests continues to compromise the\nstatus of mangrove forests globally. In DRC, the country records indicate that, about 1161 hectares of\nmangrove forest cover has been lost in the last ten years; a statistic that translates to an annual loss of\n116ha\/year.15 The threats facing these mangroves include encroachment leading to the conversion of forest\nland to settlement and other land uses, especially agriculture and settlement. The change in land use is\nlinked to population increase over the years, a condition that has prompted unsustainable harvesting of\nmangrove forests for construction wood and firewood for domestic use. The resulting consequences of the\nDR Congo mangrove deforestation and degradation threaten the livelihood of the local coastal people as\nthey get exposed to coastal flooding along with its devastating environmental repercussions. Additionally,\nthe loss of mangroves leads to carbon stored by the ecosystem being emitted back into the atmosphere\ncausing accelerated climate changes.\nThe DR Congo mangrove project is located at the mouth of River Congo in the Province Bas-Congo, in\nMuanda territory where about 23,683 hectares of mangrove occur (05\u00b045\u2019-06\u00b005\u2019S, 12\u00b045\u2019-13\u00b000\u2019E map).\nMost of the mangroves fall within a park, (Parc Marin des Mangroves, established in 1996) [1] and also\nenjoy the status of the Ramsar site, but continue to be degraded.[2] Management of the Protected Areas\nfalls to the Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature (the Congolese Institute for the Conservation\nof Nature, ICCN) following the order of law number 75\u2013023 of July 22, 1975. There is currently low visitation\nto the Parc Marin des Mangroves (English; Mangroves Marine Park, or Muanda Marine Reserve) thus\ncausing ICCN to shift its enforcement focus to more active parks. For any finances to manage park, ICCN\nrelies on technical and financial aid from its non-governmental organizations and international partners.\n13 Food and Agricultural Organization (2023).

Payments for ecosystem\nservices (PES) schemes, such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation plus\nconservation, sustainable forest management and the increase in forest carbon stocks (or REDD+) is one\napproach being championed as market-based option for forest conservation and management.\nThis project is therefore designed to implement activities that reduce human activities in the mangrove\nforest including clearance of the land for tree harvesting for non-commercial purposes, settlements, crop\nproduction (agriculturalist) or ranching or aquaculture and unplanned deforestation firewood or fuelwood,\nthus allowing for conservation and maintenance of the forest cover as well as restoring the degraded area\nof the forest. The project uses a methodology certified under the VCS program VM0007, with applicability\nin Avoided Unplanned Deforestation and Degradation in tidal wetlands. This project fits under the different\nmodules as has been identified in the methodology viz. M-REDD, M-ARR, M-TW, X-STR, X-UNC, BL-UP,\nBL-TW, LK-ASU, LK-ECO, CP-AB, and C-PD."},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

New instances will be incorporated only if they satisfy in addition\nto the requirements under methodology VM0007 and module VMD0006 (BL-PL) the following\ncriteria\nWhere inclusion of a new project activity instance necessitates the addition of a new project\nproponent to the project, such instances shall be included in the grouped project within five years\nof the project activity instance start date.\nThe risks to GHG reductions or removals are illegal logging and fire both of which would reduce\nthe amount of carbon stocks present in the property.\nv3.0 13\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nFirewood collection is not deemed a risk because the population density is very low and the main\nuse of firewood is for cooking. Unsustainable fuel wood collection is not occurring within the\nproject boundaries. Thus unsustainable fuel wood collection is not a source of leakage or\nemissions for this project.\nThe quantization of GHG reductions removals will be carried out following section 3 of this project\ndescription and merits no additional information in this section.\nThe grouped project has a central GHG information system and controls associated with the\nproject and its monitoring. The central GHG infomation system and controls will require that All\ndata will be digitalized, stored at different locations and stored for at least 2 years beyond the\ncrediting period as required under section 3.18.1 of the VCS Standard v3.2. For all instances the\nfollowing tasks will be undertaken\n1. The baseline scenario will be reviewed every ten years.\n2. Monitor carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions.\n3. Estimation of ex-post net carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions\n4. Monitor leakage and greenhouse gas emissions\nIn addition, all instances will be subjected to the same procedures of section 4 with regards to\n1. Data to be collected: list of data and parameters\n2. Overview of data collection procedures\n3. Quality control and quality assurance procedure\n4. Data archiving\n5. Organisation and responsibilities of the parties involved in all the above\n6. Frequency\nThere are no equivalent type and level of activity of products or services provided by the project\nand the baseline scenario. On the contrary, in the baseline scenario, the project area produces\ncattle and in the project, the forest remains standing. This significant difference between the\nproject and the baseline scenario is to be expected in this methodology, as agricultural activities\nare incompatible with forest remaining forests.\nLeakage Management\nUnder the followed module BL-PL there are only two sources of leakage: Market effects and\nactivity shifting. The first is calculated using module LK-ME. This module does not use any\nleakage management areas or proxy areas. The second is calculated using LK-ASP. In this\nproject the deforestation agent is always known. Therefore part I and not part II of LK-ASP\napplies. In addition, the project does not include an instance with peatland. Therefore part II of\nv3.0 14\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nLK-ASP does not apply to the project as well. Part I does not make any use of leakage\nmanagement nor proxy areas to determine leakage and none were defined or used. Rather, it\nlooks at the areas that the deforestation agent deforested. In addition, the deforestation agent no\nlonger owns the part of the property that is excluded from the project and therefore that area is\nirrelevant to the leakage calculation. When identified deforestation agents do own land that can\nbe legally deforested, the project will include them as part of its leakage management areas. As\ndeforestation agents are always identified, no proxy areas will be used in the project.\nThe leakage management program consists on monitoring the properties owned by the\ndeforestation agent as evidenced by land registry records. At this point in time, the deforestation\nagent does not own any properties that can be deforested. If properties that can be deforested\nexist in the future, they will be monitored for deforestation and if so, they will be used in the\ncalculation to determine leakage. The leakage management program therefore is necessary\n(even if today leakage is deemed to be zero) because in the future, identified deforestation\nagents may own property that can be deforested.\nCommercially Sensitive Information\nProof of ownership, images showing proxy areas defined in section 1.5 of BL-PL, deforestation\npermits and business plans have been excluded from the project description\nFurther Information\n2 APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_country': 'Bolivia'}"}]}

A brief description of the project:\n1B\nBetween 1990 and 2005 Indonesia was losing just over 2% of its forest cover annually, a rate of nearly 1.9\nmillion hectares a year1Today, that number has grown to more than 2,500,000 hectares annually \u2013 an area\nP0F (cid:31) P1\nroughly the size of Belgium (FAO 2006).Extensive loss of national forest cover has been brought about\nthrough clearing of forest areas with fire to open up land for agricultural use, especially palm oil. From\n2000\u20102005 Indonesia\u2019s forest loss represented the second highest annual loss of forest cover by area of any\ncountry in the world (after Brazil). In this same time period, Indonesia planted 1.6 million ha of oil palm,\nincreasing production by 87% (FAO 2006).\nAs part of this conversion process, post\u2010fire clearing and draining of peat lands has rapidly pushed the\ncountry to be amongst the world\u2019s largest emitters of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Today, Indonesia ranks just\nbehind the U.S. and China as the third largest2 emitter of greenhouse gas emissions, despite being a non\u2010\nP2F P industrialized nation whose economy accounts for less than 1% of global GDP3. The destruction of\nP3F P Indonesia\u2019s forests, the 3rd largest expanse of tropical rainforest in the world, combined with massive peat\u2010\nP P\nbased GHG emissions is fuelling local and global environmental concerns. The task that lay ahead for\nIndonesia and those who are seeking new solutions to value its remaining forests is to create new economic\nopportunity from these environmental challenges by linking local and national forest resources with the\nglobal market for environmental services.\nThe Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve Project, an initiative by InfiniteEARTH, aims to reduce Indonesia\u2019s\nemissions by preserving 91,215 hectares of tropical peat swamp forest. This area, rich in biodiversity\nincluding the endangered Bornean orangutan, was slated by the Provincial government to be converted\ninto four palm oil estates. Located on the southern coast of Borneo in the province of Central Kalimantan,\nthe project is also designed to protect the integrity of the adjacent world\u2010renowned Tanjung Puting\nNational Park, by creating a physical buffer zone on the full extent of the ~90km eastern border of the park.\nR2R\n1 FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment 2005\n2 Behind #1 China and #2 United States of America\n3 World Bank and IMF Global Rankings \u2010 2008\n8\n\n[['\\uf0b7 Project Start Date: November 2008'], ['\\uf0b7 Crediting Period Start Date: July 2009']]\nInfiniteEARTH\u2010Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve Project\nIn the absence of the Rimba Raya Project, the project area would be converted to palm oil plantations by\nlogging, burning to clear unused felled trees and remaining forest, and systematic draining of the peatland\narea. This would result in the release of both above and belowground carbon deposits. As a result, millions\nof tons of GHG emissions would be released into the atmosphere over the lifetime of the plantations.\nIncreasingly scarce forest habitat supporting orangutans and more than 50 other endangered species would\ndisappear completely. The 14 local forest communities along the eastern edge of the reserve would also\nface the threat of their land being appropriated by palm oil companies.\nInfiniteEARTH (IE), the principal project proponent, seeks to use the sale of carbon credits generated by the\nVoluntary Carbon Standard (VCS) through the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation\n(REDD) Avoided Planned Deforestation (APD) mechanism to provide a sustainable revenue stream sufficient\nto curtail the clearing of Rimba Raya. The Rimba Raya Project will funnel substantial and sustainable\nfinancial resources for project area protection, local community development, and provincial government\ninfrastructure and support in order to create a viable alternative to forest conversion in Indonesia.\nThe Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve Project recognizes that in order to launch and sustain a new\nmechanism for valuing forests on the ground, local community involvement is not just a sufficient feature of\nthe project, it is a necessity. Local communities have been participating in and will continue to be integrally\ninvolved in the planning and development of various aspects of the project. Programs that Rimba Raya\ncommunities have expressed interest in helping to develop and implement, include: water filtration\ndevices, distribution of clean stove technology, solar lighting, increased access to healthcare, early\nchildhood development materials and tools including the one laptop per child program, training in project\nand reserve management, and environmental conservation education. The project will create local\nemployment in protecting the Carbon Accounting Area, implementing an integrated fire management plan,\nand patrolling illegal logging and wildlife poaching.\nInfiniteEARTH aims to demonstrate that protecting endangered peat swamp forest is commercially, socially,\nand environmentally advantageous. The InfiniteEARTH vision is to develop a project that harnesses the\nglobal carbon market in order to successfully compete with commercial agricultural interests in order to\nprovide social and environmental benefits that would not otherwise be attainable. Rimba Raya peat\u2010swamp\nforests and the threats it faces are not unique, rather representative of environmental degradation of\nincreasingly scarce forest and peatland resources in Indonesia. With the Rimba Raya Project, InfiniteEARTH\nis determined to create an operational, voluntary market and community involvement model that can be\nreplicated in peat swamp forest ecosystems across Indonesia for decades to come.\n\n12B"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}"}]}

The overall aim of the project is to engage and support local\ncommunities in the protection of their village forest reserves in order to contribute to the conservation of\nimportant wildlife habitat and to mitigate climate change. The project is located in Tanganyika District, in\nWestern Tanzania, an area experiencing dramatic landscape changes over the past decade, with\ndetrimental effects on forests and critically important species such as chimpanzee. Chimpanzees rely on\nlarge expanses of forest to maintain their \u2018fusion fission\u2019 social patterns whereby troops split up and form\nnew groups on a regular basis. Sufficient forest habitat and corridors to facilitate movement throughout\nthe landscape are vital. Threats to these forest habitats include slash and burn agriculture undertaken by\na steady influx of migrants from all parts of Tanzania as well as from across the country\u2019s Western border.\nIn addition, grazing by pastoralists, mining, and the development of new infrastructure (e.g. roads)\nnegatively impact the forest, with consequences for water resources and livelihoods as well as for wildlife\nconservation.\nCarbon Tanzania, in partnership with the District Government, has identified 8 villages to collaborate with,\nand the Village Land Use Plans (VLUPs) of these villages form the basis for identifying the forest\nlandscapes to be protected under the project. These VLUPs have been prepared through a participatory\nprocess and are legally binding documents forming a key input for village development planning.\nHowever, the implementation of these plans is substantially under-resourced; this is where the Ntakata\nREDD project plays an important role in channelling carbon finance to support patrolling by Village Game\nScouts (VGS) and other activities to enhance sustainability of the resources.\nAn equally important goal is to work in partnership with local communities in order to have positive\nimpacts on their livelihoods. Carbon Tanzania works with the Village Governments as the primary\ninterface, thus utilizing existing governance structures. Carbon Tanzania (CT) will train and provide\ncompensation to Village Game Scouts (VGS) to conduct regular patrols of the forest. Additionally, overall\ngovernance in the landscape is improved through support to the Village Government in the form of\ntraining and contributions to the village development budget. Other livelihood-related interventions include\ntraining and demonstration of climate smart agriculture techniques and reproductive health services,\namong others.\nAs a result of the implementation of a range of project activities, the Ntakata REDD project is estimated to\ngenerate approximately 572,754 tCO2e (average per year over the 10-year crediting period, see section\n2.1.17.) in GHG emissions reductions on an average annual basis.\n12 In the absence of direct population or occupancy measures, measurement of reduced threats may be used as evidence of benefit\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 7\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_state_province': 'Tanganyika District', 'project_country': 'Tanzania'}"}]}
