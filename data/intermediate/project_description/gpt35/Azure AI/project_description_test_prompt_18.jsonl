Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\\r\\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 4.32tCO2e\/ha for single-cropping rice is expected.

In the\nprocess, an equivalent quantum of electricity that would have been generated by the grid in\nline with the grid electricity generation mix is displaced by the project activity. The carbon\nintensity of the fossil-fuel dominated generation mix of the grid is evident from the following\nbreak-up of various types of energy sources constituting the grid-mix contributing electricity\nto the NEWNE Grid system as shown in the table (as on Mar 2006). It is evident from the\nbelow table that a major share of about 55% of the total electricity generation is constitute by\ncoal (fossil fuel) which would have been the most plausible choice for the project proponent\nto opt for.\nTable 8: Energy Mix in India year 2005-06\n(3Source: CEA report, power scenario; Renewable Energy Sources (RES) includes SHP, BG,\nBP, U &I, and wind energy; (**) Based on data as on Mar 2006 as furnished by MNRE.)\nHence the project activity complies with this criterion.\n2. \u201cIf the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a\nwind\/diesel unit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small-scale CDM project activity applies\nonly to the renewable component.

As they grow, the\ntrees absorb carbon dioxide to offset climate change. This project activity encompasses\nthe sustainable development priorities within the following goals:\nEnvironmental Criteria:\nThe Project goal is to create viable habitat for endemic, threatened, and endangered\nspecies. By reforesting critical areas and connecting forest fragments, the Project will\nrescue species marooned in habitat fragments too small for their long-term survival. A\nseries of strategic wildlife corridors that connect isolated forests by restoring native\nvegetation and canopy cover will enable threatened and endangered species to move\nfreely, restoring genetic diversity and supporting population rebound.\nSocial Criteria:\nEnvironmental services provided by forests are essential to the social welfare of\npopulations in rural areas6. Restoring forests can ensure cleaner water by reducing soil\nerosion and avoiding sediment pollution in water reservoirs. The region also contains two\nimportant watersheds: the R\u00edo San Juan Antioquia, and R\u00edo San Juan Bravo Choc\u00f3.\nThese watersheds provide critical ecosystem services to communities living and working\nthroughout four Departamentos in the north-western cordillera (Antioquia, Choc\u00f3,\nRisaralda, and Caldas). The forests are vital to protection of the headwaters of these\nimportant sources of fresh water to the surrounding communities.

This process can be more\nsustainable and have a lower carbon footprint compared to traditional heating methods that rely\non fossil fuels.\nHowever, Scope 3 emissions could still be associated with a geothermal-based space heating\nsystem project in several ways:\nManufacturing and transportation of equipment: The production and transportation of the\nequipment needed for the geothermal system can lead to greenhouse gas emissions. This\nincludes the drilling equipment, heat exchangers, pumps, and other components.\nConstruction and installation: The construction and installation of the geothermal system at the\nproject site can lead to indirect emissions, such as those associated with the use of construction\nmachinery and the transportation of workers and materials.\n39","output":"{'crediting_period_start': '2021-11-15', 'crediting_period_end': '2031-11-14'}"}

GACL has two units located at Vadodara and Dahej, both in the\nState of Gujarat. It has integrated manufacturing facilities for Caustic Soda, Chlorine,\nHydrogen Gas, Hydrochloric Acid, Chloromethane, Hydrogen Peroxide, Phosphoric Acid,\nPotassium Hydroxide, Potassium Carbonate, Sodium Cyanide, and Sodium Ferrocyanide.,\nCalcium chloride, Anhydrous Aluminium chloride, Poly aluminium chloride.\nPurpose\nThe proposed project activity is an initiative by GACL towards clean electricity generation\nutilizing renewable energy source i.e. wind. This is a part of the long-term strategy to\nreduce dependency on the grid electricity and replace it by cleaner and environment\nfriendly technologies; GACL has implemented the scheme of installing wind power\ngenerators.\nThe project consists of 19 Wind Turbine Generators of 1.25 MW totalling to 23.75 MW\ncapacity at villages Moti Sindodhi (15 WTGs) and Varnoli (4 WTGs)3 district Kachchh,\nGujarat. This electricity is wheeled through the state electricity grid to their\nmanufacturing unit at Vadodara for consumption. Since the electricity grid & wheeling is\nconnected majorly with the fossil fuel based plants, the project activity will contribute\nsignificantly in displacing energy generation of grid based on fossil fuels and hence\nleading to Green House Gases emission reduction\nBaseline Scenario\nIn absence of the project GACL would have purchased this power from state electricity\nboard. Moreover the project activity employs the methodology ACM0002 version 10 and\n3 GEDA permission letter dated 14\/11\/2007\n3\n\n\n[['14', 'M-492', '23', '8', '49.60', '68', '46', '48.65', '23.01.2008'], ['15', 'M-493', '23', '8', '33.90', '68', '46', '56.84', '23.01.2008'], ['16', 'M-494', '23', '8', '19.44', '68', '47', '2.34', '11.02.2008'], ['17', 'M-583', '23', '9', '19.53', '68', '46', '58.10', '31.12.2007'], ['18', 'M-584', '23', '9', '6.46', '68', '47', '1.95', '23.01.2008'], ['19', 'M-515', '23', '8', '35.98', '68', '47', '19.55', '11.02.2008']]\nVCS Project Description\n1.6 Duration of the project activity\/crediting period:\nProject start date: 28\/12\/20075 (The project start date is the earliest commissioning\ndate amongst all the WTGs in this grouped project)\nCrediting Period Start date: 01\/01\/20086\nThe project activity is also claiming for the CDM benefits.

In the Pre- project scenario the entire\nelectricity was taken from the NEWNE grid by having an agreement from GEB. Gujarat\nelectricity board under the name of MGVCL is the responsible entity for the deliverance of\nthe electricity from different sources of power to the industry site at Baroda.\nSince the project activity meets all the applicability criteria for the ACM0002 Version 10,\nthe appropriate baseline for the concerned project activity is the generation of the\nelectricity in the grid.\n1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG emission reductions and\/or\nremoval enhancements:\nThe purpose of the project activity is to generate electrical power using wind energy,\nthrough the operation of wind turbines in Gujarat state of India. The wind energy\ngenerated from the wind farm is evacuated to the State Grid System through the State\nGrid\u2019s EHV sub-station. There are HV transmission lines and complete installation of\nallied equipments from individual wind turbines to the facility\u2019s switchyard and from the\nswitchyard up to the State Grid for evacuation of wind energy.\nGenerating power through wind is a clean technology as no Carbon intensive fossil fuel is\nburnt during the process.

The main deforestation and degradation agents acting within the reference region during\nthe historical period were: cattle ranching, mainly producing beef cattle; and timber harvesters, acting\nboth legally and illegally. Deforestation in the region involves spatially overlapping activities: firstly,\nextraction of commercially valuable tree species for sale to timber companies. The final step is the slash-\nand-burn deforestation of the area above for pasturelands and cattle ranching.\nThe increased complexity and costs associated with the sustainable operation of the forest as well as\nother factors such as bureaucratic constraints and price fluctuations of certified timber prices make\nsustainable forest management less competitive than illegal logging. Thus, revenue from the sales of the\nVerified Carbon Units (VCUs) is essential for the project activity to compete with profitable alternative land\nuse scenarios.\nIn addition to contributing to the long-term conservation of the region, the ABC Norte REDD Project also\nestablishes a barrier against the advancement of deforestation, making it an important contribution to\nthe conservation of Northeast Amazon biodiversity and also to climate regulation in Brazil and South\nAmerica.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\n14.
