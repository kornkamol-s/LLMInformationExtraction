1. Maintenance: Emptying the lakes allows for maintenance activities such as cleaning and removing accumulated debris, plants, and sediments. This helps to maintain the overall health and cleanliness of the lake ecosystem.

2. Preventing freezing damage: By emptying the lakes, park authorities can prevent potential damage caused by freezing temperatures. When water freezes, it expands, which can lead to cracks in the lake bed or surrounding structures. Emptying the lakes minimizes the risk of such damage.

3. Controlling invasive species: Some lakes may be prone to invasive plant species that can harm the native flora and fauna. Emptying the lakes can disrupt the life cycle of these invasive species and help prevent their spread.

4. Aesthetic reasons: Parks are often visited for their beauty and tranquility. Emptying the lakes allows for a fresh start in the spring, providing park visitors with a visually appealing and clean environment.

"Question: What city served as Poland's capital in 1313?

Context: The first historical reference to Warsaw dates back to the year 1313, at a time when KrakÃ³w served as the Polish capital city. Due to its central location between the PolishâLithuanian Commonwealth's capitals of KrakÃ³w and Vilnius, Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland when King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from KrakÃ³w to Warsaw in 1596. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Warsaw was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars, the city became the official capital of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, a puppet state of the First French Empire established by Napoleon Bonaparte. In accordance with the decisions of the Congress of Vienna, the Russian Empire annexed Warsaw in 1815 and it became part of the ""Congress Kingdom"". Only in 1918 did it regain independence from the foreign rule and emerge as a new capital of the independent Republic of Poland. The German invasion in 1939, the massacre of the Jewish population and deportations to concentration camps led to the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943 and to the major and devastating Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944. Warsaw gained the title of the ""Phoenix City"" because it has survived many wars, conflicts and invasions throughout its long history. Most notably, the city required painstaking rebuilding after the extensive damage it suffered in World War II, which destroyed 85% of its buildings. On 9 November 1940, the city was awarded Poland's highest military decoration for heroism, the Virtuti Militari, during the Siege of Warsaw (1939).","[""Kraków""]",The city that served as Poland's capital in 1313 was KrakÃ³w.,0.0,0.15384615384615385,1.0,0.2666666666666667,0.08333333333333333,1.0,0.15384615384615385,0.15384615384615385,1.0,0.2666666666666667,0.15384615384615385,1.0,0.2666666666666667

"Question: What army was pushing deep into Polish territory to pursue the Germans in 1944?

Context: By July 1944, the Red Army was deep into Polish territory and pursuing the Germans toward Warsaw. Knowing that Stalin was hostile to the idea of an independent Poland, the Polish government-in-exile in London gave orders to the underground Home Army (AK) to try to seize control of Warsaw from the Germans before the Red Army arrived. Thus, on 1 August 1944, as the Red Army was nearing the city, the Warsaw Uprising began. The armed struggle, planned to last 48 hours, was partially successful, however it went on for 63 days. Eventually the Home Army fighters and civilians assisting them were forced to capitulate. They were transported to PoW camps in Germany, while the entire civilian population was expelled. Polish civilian deaths are estimated at between 150,000 and 200,000.","[""the Red Army"", ""Red Army"", ""e Red Army""]","The army that was pushing deep into Polish territory to pursue the Germans in 1944 was the Red Army, which was the Soviet Union's army.",0.10675210253672474,0.19230769230769232,0.625,0.29411764705882354,0.08,0.2857142857142857,0.125,0.19230769230769232,0.625,0.29411764705882354,0.19230769230769232,0.625,0.29411764705882354

Polish civilian deaths are estimated at between 150,000 and 200,000.","[""Stalin was hostile to the idea of an independent Poland""]","The exiled Polish government in London ordered the underground Home Army to seize control of Warsaw prior to the arrival of the Red Army for a few reasons:

1. Desire for Polish self-determination: The Polish government-in-exile wanted to establish a legitimate Polish authority in Warsaw before the Soviet-backed Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN) could establish its control. The government-in-exile feared that the PKWN would be a puppet government under Soviet influence and did not want to lose their chance to establish an independent Poland.

2. Political motivations: The Polish government-in-exile sought to demonstrate its legitimacy and assert its authority over the Polish population. By leading an armed uprising against the German occupiers, they aimed to show the Polish people and the international community that they were the legitimate representatives of Poland.

3. Concerns about Soviet intentions: The Polish government-in-exile was aware of Stalin's hostility towards the idea of an independent Poland. They feared that the Red Army would not only liberate Poland from German occupation but also impose Soviet control over the country. By taking control of Warsaw before the arrival of the Red Army, they hoped to establish a Polish authority that could negotiate with the Soviets from a position of strength.

4. Symbolic importance: Warsaw, as the capital of Poland, held significant symbolic value. The government-in-exile wanted to demonstrate their commitment to the Polish people by leading a major uprising in the heart of the country.

However, the Warsaw Uprising did not achieve its intended goals and resulted in significant loss of life and destruction. The reasons for its failure are complex and involve factors such as the German military response, lack of support from the Western Allies, and the Soviet Union's decision to halt their advance on Warsaw.",0.021616885058355847,0.032679738562091505,1.0,0.06329113924050632,0.019672131147540985,0.6666666666666666,0.038216560509554146,0.026143790849673203,0.8,0.05063291139240506,0.029411764705882353,0.9,0.056962025316455694

"Question: What does Warsaw's mixture of architectural styles reflect?

Context: Warsaw's mixture of architectural styles reflects the turbulent history of the city and country. During the Second World War, Warsaw was razed to the ground by bombing raids and planned destruction. After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled PRL. Most of the historical buildings were thoroughly reconstructed. However, some of the buildings from the 19th century that had been preserved in reasonably reconstructible form were nonetheless eradicated in the 1950s and 1960s (e.g. Leopold Kronenberg Palace). Mass residential blocks were erected, with basic design typical of Eastern bloc countries.","[""turbulent history of the city"", ""turbulent history of the city and country""]","Warsaw's mixture of architectural styles reflects the city's turbulent history and the various influences that have shaped it over time. The destruction of the city during World War II led to extensive rebuilding efforts, resulting in a blend of reconstructed historical buildings and new structures. 

The architectural styles in Warsaw range from pre-war neoclassical and Gothic Revival designs to post-war socialist realist and modernist buildings.

"Question: When was Warsaw completely razed to the ground by bombing raids?

Context: Warsaw's mixture of architectural styles reflects the turbulent history of the city and country. During the Second World War, Warsaw was razed to the ground by bombing raids and planned destruction. After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled PRL. Most of the historical buildings were thoroughly reconstructed. However, some of the buildings from the 19th century that had been preserved in reasonably reconstructible form were nonetheless eradicated in the 1950s and 1960s (e.g. Leopold Kronenberg Palace).

This meant that many historic buildings, including those of bourgeois architecture, were either neglected or demolished.

Secondly, some of the buildings, like the Warsaw Philharmony edifice, were rebuilt in the style of socialist realism.

Context: Institutionally, the Normans combined the administrative machinery of the Byzantines, Arabs, and Lombards with their own conceptions of feudal law and order to forge a unique government. Under this state, there was great religious freedom, and alongside the Norman nobles existed a meritocratic bureaucracy of Jews, Muslims and Christians, both Catholic and Eastern Orthodox.

"Question: Who kicked Ethelred out?

Context: The Normans were in contact with England from an early date. Not only were their original Viking brethren still ravaging the English coasts, they occupied most of the important ports opposite England across the English Channel. This relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the marriage of Emma, sister of Duke Richard II of Normandy, and King Ethelred II of England. Because of this, Ethelred fled to Normandy in 1013, when he was forced from his kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard.

"Question: Who was Edward the Confessor's half-brother?

Context: When finally Edward the Confessor returned from his father's refuge in 1041, at the invitation of his half-brother Harthacnut, he brought with him a Norman-educated mind. He also brought many Norman counsellors and fighters, some of whom established an English cavalry force. This concept never really took root, but it is a typical example of the attitudes of Edward. He appointed Robert of JumiÃ¨ges archbishop of Canterbury and made Ralph the Timid earl of Hereford. He invited his brother-in-law Eustace II, Count of Boulogne to his court in 1051, an event which resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between Saxon and Norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of Earl Godwin of Wessex.","[""Harthacnut""]",Edward the Confessor's half-brother was Harthacnut.,0.0,0.125,1.0,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125,1.0,0.2222222222222222,0.125,1.0,0.2222222222222222

"Question: What culture's arrival in Scotland is know as the ""Davidian Revolution""?

Context: Normans came into Scotland, building castles and founding noble families who would provide some future kings, such as Robert the Bruce, as well as founding a considerable number of the Scottish clans. King David I of Scotland, whose elder brother Alexander I had married Sybilla of Normandy, was instrumental in introducing Normans and Norman culture to Scotland, part of the process some scholars call the ""Davidian Revolution"". Having spent time at the court of Henry I of England (married to David's sister Maud of Scotland), and needing them to wrestle the kingdom from his half-brother MÃ¡el Coluim mac Alaxandair, David had to reward many with lands. The process was continued under David's successors, most intensely of all under William the Lion. The Norman-derived feudal system was applied in varying degrees to most of Scotland. Scottish families of the names Bruce, Gray, Ramsay, Fraser, Ogilvie, Montgomery, Sinclair, Pollock, Burnard, Douglas and Gordon to name but a few, and including the later royal House of Stewart, can all be traced back to Norman ancestry.","[""Norman""]","The culture's arrival in Scotland that is known as the ""Davidian Revolution"" is the Norman culture.",0.0,0.058823529411764705,1.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,1.0,0.1111111111111111,0.058823529411764705,1.0,0.1111111111111111

1. Efficiency: AC electricity allowed for more efficient transmission of power over long distances compared to DC electricity. AC could be easily converted to high voltages using transformers, which reduced power loss during transmission. This made AC a more cost-effective option for powering cities and industries.

2. Safety: AC electricity is less dangerous than DC electricity at high voltages. In AC systems, the voltage periodically reverses direction, which means that the current periodically crosses zero, reducing the risk of electrical shock. This made AC a safer choice for widespread distribution and use.

3. Scalability: AC systems allowed for the efficient generation and distribution of electricity on a large scale. The use of polyphase current in AC systems, as developed by Tesla, allowed for the generation of a rotating magnetic field, which simplified the design of motors and generators. This made it easier to build and operate power plants and machinery that required high-power outputs.

4. Lower maintenance: AC motors, like Tesla's induction motor, did not require a commutator, which eliminated the need for mechanical brushes. This greatly reduced maintenance requirements and increased the reliability of AC motors compared to DC motors, which required regular maintenance and brush replacement.

Overall, the efficiency, safety, scalability, and lower maintenance requirements of AC electricity made it increasingly popular and led to its widespread adoption for power generation and distribution.",0.0,0.05084745762711865,0.7058823529411765,0.09486166007905139,0.01276595744680851,0.1875,0.02390438247011952,0.03389830508474576,0.47058823529411764,0.06324110671936758,0.0423728813559322,0.5882352941176471,0.07905138339920949

Westinghouse likely believed that Tesla's patent would control the market and provide a competitive advantage.

3. Cost and Effort: Applying for a patent involves significant costs and effort, including legal fees and the patent application process itself. Westinghouse may have determined that pursuing a similar patent for a motor already being developed by Tesla and potentially facing legal challenges was not worth the investment.

This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and Westinghouse using his own patented AC system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while. The competition resulted in Edison Machine Works pursuing AC development in 1890 and by 1892 Thomas Edison was no longer in control of his own company, which was consolidated into the conglomerate General Electric and converting to an AC delivery system at that point.","[""financial strain"", ""the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build""]","The delay during the development of the AC motor was primarily caused by the intense competition between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse, known as the ""War of Currents."" 

Initially, Edison held all the patents for DC (direct current) and the incandescent light, while Westinghouse used his patented AC (alternating current) system to power arc lights and incandescent lamps. Tesla's demonstration of his induction motor in 1888, followed by Westinghouse licensing the patent, gave Westinghouse a significant advantage in the battle.

However, in order to build a fully integrated AC system, Westinghouse needed to acquire additional patents and hire engineers. This financial strain meant that the development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for some time.

During this period, the competition between Edison and Westinghouse intensified. In 1890, Edison Machine Works began pursuing AC development, and by 1892, Thomas Edison lost control of his own company, which was consolidated into the conglomerate General Electric. At that point, General Electric also shifted to an AC delivery system.

Overall, the delay in the development of the AC motor was primarily due to the financial strain faced by Westinghouse in acquiring patents and hiring engineers, as well as the intense competition between Edison and Westinghouse during the ""War of Currents.""",0.04795254685263565,0.06635071090047394,0.875,0.12334801762114538,0.03333333333333333,0.4666666666666667,0.06222222222222222,0.04265402843601896,0.5625,0.07929515418502203,0.052132701421800945,0.6875,0.09691629955947136

Westinghouse convinced Tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over Tesla's AC patents in exchange for Westinghouse Electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of $216,000; this provided Westinghouse a break from what, due to alternating current's rapid gain in popularity, had turned out to be an overly generous $2.50 per AC horsepower royalty.","[""an estimated $200,000"", ""estimated $200,000"", ""an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties""]","Westinghouse had paid an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla, Brown, and Peck up to that point.",0.3409643899815635,0.4,0.5333333333333333,0.4571428571428572,0.3684210526315789,0.5,0.4242424242424242,0.4,0.5333333333333333,0.4571428571428572,0.4,0.5333333333333333,0.4571428571428572

"Question: When were Tesla's patents restored?

Context: In 1900, Tesla was granted patents for a ""system of transmitting electrical energy"" and ""an electrical transmitter."" When Guglielmo Marconi made his famous first-ever transatlantic radio transmission in 1901, Tesla quipped that it was done with 17 Tesla patents, though there is little to support this claim. This was the beginning of years of patent battles over radio with Tesla's patents being upheld in 1903, followed by a reverse decision in favor of Marconi in 1904. In 1943, a Supreme Court of the United States decision restored the prior patents of Tesla, Oliver Lodge, and John Stone. The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patents were questionable, he could not claim infringement on those same patents (there are claims the high court was trying to nullify a World War I claim against the U.S. government by the Marconi Company via simply restoring Tesla's prior patent).","[""1943""]",Tesla's patents were restored in 1943 by a Supreme Court of the United States decision.,0.0,0.0625,1.0,0.11764705882352941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,1.0,0.11764705882352941,0.0625,1.0,0.11764705882352941

1. Resource allocation: By understanding the complexity of a problem, developers and engineers can allocate appropriate computational resources to solve it efficiently. For example, if a problem has a high time complexity, they may need to optimize algorithms or use more powerful hardware to ensure timely execution.

2. Algorithm selection: Different algorithms have varying levels of complexity for solving a given problem. By knowing the complexity, developers can choose the most suitable algorithm that balances time and space requirements. Complexity analysis helps in identifying the most efficient algorithm for solving a problem.

3. Performance estimation: Complexity analysis provides a way to estimate the expected performance of an algorithm or program. It helps in predicting how the execution time or resource usage will scale with the input size. This knowledge is valuable for optimizing and fine-tuning software to meet performance requirements.

4. Problem classification: Complexity theory categorizes problems into different classes based on their complexity levels, such as P (polynomial time), NP (nondeterministic polynomial time), and NP-complete. This classification helps in understanding the inherent difficulty of problems and identifying those that are likely to be computationally infeasible or time-consuming.

5. Limitations and boundaries: Computational complexity theory helps in identifying the practical limits of what computers can achieve. It helps in determining problems that are inherently difficult and may not have efficient solutions.

Usually, the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet (i.e., the set {0,1}), and thus the strings are bitstrings.

"Question: If NP is not equal to P, viewed through this lens, what type of problems can also be considered intractable?

Context: Problems that can be solved in theory (e.g., given large but finite time), but which in practice take too long for their solutions to be useful, are known as intractable problems. In complexity theory, problems that lack polynomial-time solutions are considered to be intractable for more than the smallest inputs. In fact, the CobhamâEdmonds thesis states that only those problems that can be solved in polynomial time can be feasibly computed on some computational device. Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are EXPTIME-hard. If NP is not the same as P, then the NP-complete problems are also intractable in this sense. To see why exponential-time algorithms might be unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting. For small n, say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 1012 operations each second, the program would run for about 4 Ã 1010 years, which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress. Nevertheless, a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical. If its running time is, say, n15, it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances.","[""NP-complete problems"", ""NP-complete""]","In addition to NP-complete problems, there are other types of problems that can be considered intractable if NP is not equal to P. Here are a few examples:

1. EXPSPACE-hard problems: These are problems that require exponential space to solve. Even if an algorithm exists to solve them, the amount of memory required grows exponentially with the size of the input. This makes them impractical to solve for large inputs.

2. PSPACE-complete problems: These are problems that are complete for the complexity class PSPACE, which includes all problems that can be solved using a polynomial amount of memory. If NP is not equal to P, then PSPACE-complete problems would also be considered intractable.

3. Bounded-depth search problems: These are problems that can be solved using a polynomial amount of time, but only if the search depth is limited to a constant value. If the search depth is allowed to grow with the size of the input, the problem becomes intractable.

However, there are various approximation algorithms and heuristics that can provide reasonably good solutions to the knapsack problem in a reasonable amount of time for many instances. These algorithms often have a time complexity that is less than quadratic, allowing them to handle larger problem sizes efficiently.

It is important to note that while these algorithms can provide good solutions in practice, they do not guarantee finding the optimal solution. In some cases, finding the exact optimal solution may still require an exponential amount of time.

In summary, the time required to solve an NP-complete knapsack problem can vary depending on the specific algorithm used and the size of the problem instance. While algorithms exist that can solve the problem efficiently for many instances, finding the exact optimal solution remains a computationally challenging task.",0.018032136142276264,0.030927835051546393,0.6666666666666666,0.05911330049261084,0.010362694300518135,0.25,0.019900497512437814,0.030927835051546393,0.6666666666666666,0.05911330049261084,0.030927835051546393,0.6666666666666666,0.05911330049261084

2. Community organizations: Non-profit organizations, community centers, and grassroots movements often operate with popularly based authority. These organizations involve community members in decision-making processes, allowing them to have a say in the direction and activities of the group. This approach promotes inclusivity, collaboration, and a sense of shared responsibility.

3. Co-operative businesses: Co-operatives are businesses owned and controlled by their members, who have equal voting rights regardless of their capital investment. Co-operatives operate on the principle of popularly based authority, where decisions are made democratically by the members. This model allows for a more equitable distribution of power and resources.

4. Local governments: In some municipalities, participatory democracy initiatives have been implemented to involve residents in decision-making processes. These initiatives often include participatory budgeting, where community members decide how public funds should be allocated. By involving citizens in decision-making, local governments can ensure that policies and projects align with the needs and desires of the community.

1. Stigma and societal expectations: The teaching profession has traditionally been seen as a predominantly female profession. Men who choose to become teachers may face stereotypes or societal expectations that associate teaching with femininity, which can deter some men from pursuing this career.

2. Fear of false accusations: In recent years, there have been high-profile cases of teachers engaging in inappropriate relationships with students. The fear of being falsely accused of misconduct can discourage some men from pursuing a career in teaching, as they may worry about the potential damage to their personal and professional reputation.

3. Negative media portrayal: Media coverage often focuses on cases of male teachers involved in sexual misconduct, which can contribute to the perception that men in teaching are a potential risk. This negative portrayal may dissuade some men from considering teaching as a career option.

4. Lack of male role models: The shortage of male teachers can perpetuate the idea that teaching is not a suitable career choice for men. Without sufficient male role models in the profession, young boys may not see teaching as a viable career option, further exacerbating the shortage of male teachers.

It's important to note that these reasons may vary by individual and cultural context.

1. High workloads: Teachers often have to manage large class sizes, prepare lesson plans, grade assignments, and perform administrative tasks. The pressure to meet deadlines and maintain high standards can lead to stress and exhaustion.

2. Lack of support: Teachers may feel unsupported by their colleagues, administrators, or the school system. This can manifest as a lack of resources, inadequate professional development opportunities, or limited emotional support.

3. Classroom management challenges: Dealing with disruptive behavior, conflicts among students, or difficult parent interactions can contribute to stress and anxiety for teachers.

4. Emotional demands: Teachers are responsible for the emotional well-being of their students, which can be emotionally draining. They may also experience personal emotional challenges related to their students' struggles or traumatic events.

5. Limited autonomy: Teachers often have to adhere to strict curriculum guidelines and standardized testing requirements, leaving them with limited control over their teaching methods and content. This lack of autonomy can lead to frustration and a sense of being ineffective.

6. Bullying and harassment: Teachers may face bullying or harassment from students, parents, or even colleagues. These experiences can be emotionally distressing and have long-term effects on mental health.

7. Work-life balance: Teachers often work long hours, including evenings and weekends, to meet the demands of their job. This can result in a lack of personal time, leading to fatigue, stress, and difficulty maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

In the context of teachers and their occupational hazards, here are some potential outcomes of organizational change:

1. Improved working conditions: If the organizational change addresses some of the factors contributing to teacher stress, such as reducing workload, improving the working environment, or providing additional support, it can lead to a decrease in occupational stress and improved mental and physical health for teachers.

2. Increased job satisfaction: Changes that improve relationships with students, fellow teachers, and administrative personnel can contribute to a more positive work environment and increased job satisfaction for teachers.

3. Enhanced productivity and student performance: By reducing stress and improving working conditions, organizational changes can positively impact teacher productivity and, consequently, student performance. When teachers are less burdened by stress and have better support systems in place, they can focus more on teaching and providing quality education.

4. Reduced burnout rates: If the organizational change effectively addresses the factors contributing to burnout, such as excessive workload or unrealistic expectations, it can help reduce burnout rates among teachers. This, in turn, can lead to higher retention rates and a more sustainable teaching workforce.

Here are a few examples:

1. Lack of effective communication: Poor communication skills or ineffective communication methods can hinder students' understanding and engagement with the material being taught. This can lead to a decrease in student performance as they may struggle to grasp concepts or feel disengaged from the learning process.

2. Inadequate preparation and planning: Teachers who are not adequately prepared or organized may struggle to deliver lessons effectively. This can result in a lack of clarity and structure in the classroom, making it difficult for students to comprehend the subject matter and perform well academically.

3. Inconsistent or unfair grading practices: If teachers are inconsistent in their grading methods or display favoritism, it can create a lack of motivation and trust among students. This may result in decreased effort and performance as students may perceive their efforts as undervalued or unfairly assessed.

4. Lack of individualized attention: Students have different learning styles and abilities, and teachers who do not provide individualized attention or support may hinder student progress. When students' unique needs are not addressed, it can lead to frustration, disengagement, and ultimately lower performance.

5. Negative classroom environment: A negative classroom environment, characterized by lack of respect, bullying, or a hostile atmosphere, can have a detrimental impact on student performance. Students may feel anxious, unsafe, or disengaged, inhibiting their ability to focus and learn effectively.
