PROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-PDD) - Version 03
CDM – Executive Board
The identified CDM project is being promoted by Vish Wind Infrastructure LLP & Vaayu Infrastructure
LLP. Vish Wind Infrastructure LLP (one of the PP in present Bundle) has previously installed following
three projects in Jamnagar district.
1) Bundled Wind Power Project in Jamnagar, Gujarat (UNFCCC Reg No:4964)
This is a small scale bundled CDM wind power project by the project proponent (Vish Wind
Infrastructure LLP) and J. N. Investment & Trading Co. Private Limited in the state of Gujarat. The same
can be viewed on the UNFCCC website for CDM.
http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/DB/SGS-UKL1309779882.44/view
The above WECs are located in Jamjodhpur taluka while the present project WECs are located in Lalpur
taluka of Jamnagar District. Therefore, The above location details are at a distance of about 53 km from
the present project machine locations (http://www.distancesfrom.com).
2) Wind Energy Project in Gujarat
This is a large scale CDM wind power project by Vish Wind Infrastructure LLP in district Kutch and
Lalpur of Gujarat. Project is under CDM validation and same can be viewed on the UNFCCC website:
http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/Validation/DB/IK1BYLA1OA6M6X4NT9D8FKKFF77CQZ/view.html
Though Vish Wind Infrastructure is having another CDM project activity which is under validation in the
same lalpur taluka, the two closest WECs of present project activity and above mentioned project are
located around 12 km from each other.
3) Grid connected clean energy project in Jamnagar, Gujarat
This is a small scale CDM wind power project by Vish Wind Infrastructure LLP in the state of Gujarat.
The same can be viewed on the UNFCCC website for CDM.
http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/Validation/DB/BNP1KWH4T98RXXRK88MEREP7S0WQOF/view.html
The above WECs are located in Jamjodhpur taluka while the present project WECs are located in Lalpur
taluka. Therefore, The above location details are at a distance of about 53 km from the present project
machine locations. (http://www.distancesfrom.com).
Thus it can be confirmed that the present activity is not a de-bundled component of a large scale project.
This is in line with “Guidelines on Assessment of Debundling for SSC project activities, Version 03, EB
54, Annex 13”. Thus it is demonstrated that the present project activity is not a de-bundled component of
any large scale project activity.

Mexico is one of the five countries with the largest extension of mangroves in the world with
775,555 ha (Valderrama-Landeros et al. 2017)1. In Mexico, the mangrove areas in the state of
Campeche are significantly impacted by deforestation and anthropogenic fires. The Project
activity is a REDD+ grouped project that will generate GHG emissions reductions by avoiding the
unplanned deforestation of wetlands in the state of Campeche, while collaborating in partnership
with local communities to preserve the forest and secure biodiversity and social benefits.
The grouped project area currently encompasses 87,751 ha within Petenes and Laguna de
Términos regions in Campeche. There are 32 (thirty-two) initial project activity instances (iPAIs)
comprising 32,599 ha eligible for blue carbon conservation, estimated to reduce approximately
316,924 tCO e average per year. The grouped project will include more landowners as partners 2
and areas for conservation as the project advances. The grouped project area is not covered by
any jurisdictional REDD+ program.
The major deforestation drivers identified in the region are agriculture (i.a., oil palm, maize, and
rice plantations), cattle ranching, and other unsustainable practices in e.g., tourism and fisheries;
infrastructure development; canal silting; storm damage; firewood harvesting; and anthropogenic
fires, among others. The strategic blue carbon conservation activities, include i.a.:
• Tidal canal rehabilitation and maintenance.
• Soil rehabilitation and promotion of natural mangrove forest regeneration.
• Mangrove deforestation and biophysical monitoring.
• Community training and development of workshops including experiences exchange.
• Institutional coordination for enhancing mangrove conservation activities.
The project proponent has been engaging with communities in ejidos (communal lands), state
and private lands under a participatory, inclusive, and collaborative approach. The project began
on January 17, 2019, hosting communities’ experiences exchange, capacity building,
hydrological rehabilitation, environmental and biodiversity monitoring activities.
BlueMX is advancing the design of the project complying with the Climate, Community and
Biodiversity (CCB) Standards criteria and requirements. The CCB PD will be presented for the
corresponding certification.

1.3 Estimated amount of emission reductions over the crediting period
including project size:
The project activity employs the renewable crediting period and the estimated
emission reductions of the project during the first crediting period (from 28th
March 2006 to 27th March 2016) are presented in following tables. Estimated
emission reductions of the project throughout the first crediting period are
27,386 tonnes CO . 2
Table 1: Estimated Emission Reductions
As per “Voluntary Carbon Standard 2007.1”, projects are divided into the
following three groups:
 Micro project: Less than 5,000 tonnes CO equivalent emissions reductions 2
per year
1 Refer to: http://cdm.unfccc.int/methodologies/SSCmethodologies

 Projects: 5,000- 1,000,000 tCO2e- per year
 Mega Project: More than 1,000,000 tonnes CO equivalent emissions 2
reductions per year
Since the project activity would lead to emission reductions of 27,386 tCO2e
annually, it falls under the category: “Projects: 5,000- 1,000,000 tCO2e- per

AR-AM0014VERSION03.0-methodologyisapplicableunderthefollowingconditions:
(a) Theland subjecttotheproject activityisdegraded mangrovehabitat;
The project activity comprises planting of diverse native mangrove species on several
discrete parcels of land. These parcels are located on estuarine islands in the estuaries of
several rivers which contain degraded mangrove habitats. The project identifies suitable
patches of land within these degraded mangrove habitats that are found most appropriate
forplanting activities.
The implementation partner along with the local community select parcels of land within
degraded mangrovehabitatsthat aremost appropriatefor planting and restoration activity..
The sites for restoration are selected based on certain criteria for selection that include (i)
site suitability for planting activities that will ensure maximum survival (ii) sites should be
located within degraded mangrove habitats (iii) there should be no clearing of native
ecosystems in order to implement project activities (iv) the project should not cause a
change in the ecosystem of the planting sites (v) availability of land (vi) site selection
criteria as defined in previous sections of this document. Once identified, all plot
boundaries are demarcated using GIS technology before planting activities start in the plot.
The planting parcels are assessed through RS GIS analysis to confirm that the parcels of
land meet alltheeligibilityconditionsofthemethodologyandtheVCSstandard.

3. Abandoned agriculturallands withpresenceofsparsemangrovetrees and shrubs
Degraded habitats are characterised bylow crown cover ofmangrove, low diversity ofmangrove
and mangrove associated species, stands with poor or stunted growth, conversion of
mangroves for intensive aquaculture or agriculture, presence of weeds or invasive species that
wouldhinder natural regeneration.
This is confirmed by the implementation partner and only sites that meet this criteria are
selected for this project. This is supported by confirmation from the field team and through RS
GIS analysis of the project parcels and surrounding mangrove areas Therefore the parcels of
land under the project are located within degraded mangrove habitats. Images present in
section 1.13 of this document show the project area and project parcels prior to planting, and
demonstratesthat thelandsaredegraded mangrovehabitats.
(b) More than 90percent of the project area is planted with mangrove species. If more than
10percent oftheproject area is plantedwithnon-mangrovespecies then theproject activity
does not lead to alteration of hydrology of the project area and hydrology of connected up-
gradientanddown-gradient wetlandarea;
More than 90% of the project area is planted with native mangrove species - Rhizophora

tool is used for baseline calculations. It determines the CO emission factor for the displacement 2
of electricity generated by power plants in an electricity system, by calculating the Combined
Margin emission factor (CM) of the electricity system. The CM is the result of a weighted average
of two emission factors pertaining to the electricity system: the Operating Margin (OM) and the
Build Margin (BM).

When we consider the project listed in Table 8, this project is different from Kepezkaya HPP in
the following aspects:
• The project Pamuk HPP was commissioned in 2004 long before carbon finance was
available in Turkey.
• It was developed before the 2008 financial crisis so it was developed in a different
investment climate.
• This project is 23.7 MW so it is smaller in size than Kepezkaya Project.
• The project was developed in DSI Adana Jurisdiction.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
3 QUANTIFICATION OF GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND REMOVALS
3.1 Baseline Emissions
According to the latest version (version 13.0.0) of ACM0002 and the tool to calculate the emission
factor for electricity system, since the project activity is the installation of a new grid-connected
renewable power plant/unit, the baseline scenario is the following:
Electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have
otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power
plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as reflected in the
combined margin (CM) calculations described in the “Tool to calculate
the emission factor for an electricity system” (version 02.2.1 (EB63)).
The Project therefore applies the combined margin (CM) calculations described in the “Tool to
calculate the emission factor for an electricity system” (version 02.2.1 (EB63)).
Step 1 -Identify the relevant electric power system
As the host country is not participating in the compliance markets hence does not have a DNA, a
delineation of the project electricity system and connected electricity systems has not been
published yet. For such cases, the tool suggests using the following criteria to determine the
existence of significant transmission constraints:
1. “In case of electricity systems with spot markets for electricity: there are differences in electricity
prices (without transmission and distribution costs) of more than 5 percent between the systems
during 60 percent or more of the hours of the year.” This criteria is not applicable as there is no
spot electricity market in the host country.
2. “The transmission line is operated at 90% or more of its rated capacity during 90% percent or
more of the hours of the year”: The transmission line operator (TEIAS) or any other official source
has not published the capacity usage figures for the Turkish grid, hence this criterion can not be
proved.
According to the tool, where the application of these criteria does not result in a clear grid
boundary, a regional grid definition in the case of large countries with layered dispatch systems
(e.g. provincial / regional / national) shall be used. A provincial grid definition may indeed in many
cases be too narrow given significant electricity trade among provinces that might be affected,
directly or indirectly, by a CDM project activity. In other countries, the national (or other largest)
grid definition should be used by default.
Therefore, for the case of the subject project activity “the project electricity system” and “the
connected system” are same, and the Turkish National Grid is used as the “project electricity
system”. It is also confirmed by TEIAS that the Turkish grid is interconnected. There isn’t any
independent or regional grid system in any region of Turkey. The map of the Turkish Electricity
Grid is given in the below figure (Figure 10):
v3.0 28

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3

http://www.epdk.gov.tr/documents/10157/48dd12d4-74da-4dcf-9f48-86983146c0d8)
All the calculations details of which are given below are made for the entire Turkish Grid.
Step 2 - Choose whether to include off-grid power plants in the project electricity system
The tool requires Project participants to choose between the following two options to calculate the
operating margin and build margin emission factor:
Option I: Only grid power plants are included in the calculation.
Option II: Both grid power plants and off-grid power plants are included in the calculation.
In our case, “Option I” has been selected for the calculation of grid emission factor, and only grid
power plants are included in the calculation.
Step 3 – Select an operating margin (OM) method
According to the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system‟, version 02.2.1 in
calculating the Operating Margin grid emission factor for a given year y (EFgrid,OM, y), project
developers have the option of selecting from four methods:
(a) Simple OM,
(b) Simple adjusted OM,
(c) Dispatch Data Analysis OM, or

1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:
Project location was a hilltop prior to initiation of the project
this is used by general public for site seeing only. WEG are
installed on top of the hill by excavating hard rock. Moderate
vegetation on hill slopes was not disturbed.
Electricity has a universal role in the economic development.
It has a dual function as a “factor of production” and as a
“consumer good” that increases the quality of life. Energy needs of
the country are growing in tune with the needs of the liberalised
economy. With an installed capacity around 132329 MW, Indian power

130,project_description,"2.1.1 Summary Description of the Project (G1.2)
The Marajó REDD+ Project is located in the State of Pará, Brazil and it comprises 138,285
hectares of Amazonian lowland forest up to 40 meters of elevation, in mostly flat or slightly
undulating terrain near the Amazon river delta. The area is near mid-size cities (Portel) and is made
up of disturbed terra-firme (non-flooded) with only small areas in várzea (seasonally flooded)
forests. Although the area is far removed (80+ km north) from the Trans-Amazonian Highway
(Rodovia Transamazônica, BR-230), river and sea access has facilitated extraction of most
precious woods, and most forest areas are heavily intervened; settlement by ribeirinhos (river-
margin dwellers) is also spreading westward from the Atlantic. There are also a few logging
concessions authorized by the Brazilian government operating in the area. Mining operations do
not seem to be a problem in the territories.
Most riverside people (comunidades ribeirinhas extrativistas) subsist by a mix of fishing, hunting,
and especially by harvesting açaí palm fruits and by cultivating cassava from which flour is made,
as the latter two are the main staple foods of the people in the state of Pará. Agriculture is practiced
in small-scale slash-and-burn plots for the cassava; the açaí palms, which thrive and naturally occur
in seasonal floodplain areas near the river (várzea forest), are harvested from the wild and
fostered/planted near settlements and homesteads.
The Marajo REDD+ Project has a significant amount of forest and is home to several ecologically
important flora and fauna in a strategic region of the Amazon where there is high deforestation risk
caused by illegal logging and expanding slash-and-burn agriculture. The project has implemented
via REDDA Projetos Ambientais Sociedade Unipesoal Ltda. (REDDA) a number of activities that
seek to reduce forest degradation and deforestation in the project area. These activities include:
• Patrolling.
Members of the local communities (comunidades ribeirinhas extrativistas) are being
employed by the project to perform regular patrol through the project area, with a focus on
high-risk degradation/deforestation areas. The patrol units cooperate with the local
authorities to prevent illegal encroachment in the project area. This activity deters the main
drivers of Avoided Unplanned Deforestation and Degradation (AUDD) such as illegal
timber extraction and slash-and-burn agriculture.
• Alternative Sources of Income.
In order to reduce forest degradation, it is important that the riverside communities can
reduce their dependency on unsustainable harvesting of forest resources. To achieve this,
the Marajo REDD+ project is already implementing and will continue to implement a
number of activities that will provide the community members with alternative sources of
income. These activities include but are not limited to:
o Access to training and education:
Many people within these communities have little to no access to proper schooling.
The project will build several schools throughout the project area, which will allow
children to receive an education and increase their opportunities in the job market.
This as well as other training offers will also create a framework for learning about
sustainable practices and forest conservation.

o Eco-jewellery:
The project will stimulate the sustainable use of socio-bioeconomy products by its
inhabitants. An example of this is the creation of eco-jewellery, which in turn can
be sold to generate additional income. The project has facilitated workshops,
mainly aimed at women, to increase their proficiency in these skills and in doing
so broaden their opportunities of income generation.
o Strategic partnerships with local sustainable companies:
In cooperation with the local communities, the project has established partnerships
to promote the sustainable use of non-timber forest products. These partnerships
encourage income generation of hundreds of riverside families. Specifically, the
following two partnerships have been established up until now:
(i) Amazon Forest People
The Marajo REDD+ Project has partnered with Amazon Forest People, a local
cosmetics company. Under this partnership, oilseeds will be extracted by
participating communities and sold to AFM to be used in their cosmetic products.
(ii) Amazon Oil
Additionally, the Marajo REDD+ Project has established a partnership with

opportunities for future partnerships are being explored in cooperation with the

• Installation of biodigesters in local communities.
To meet the communities’ thermal energy needs, mostly for the preparation of food, the
use of fuelwood and charcoal is still commonplace for the riverside communities. The
extraction of fuelwood from the forest contributes to forest degradation. To mitigate this
driver of degradation, the project is deploying biodigesters in the riverside communities,
allowing them to convert their organic waste into biogas. In addition to a reduction in
fuelwood collection, this also creates a net health benefit: the combustion of fuelwood,
especially in enclosed spaces, can lead to a variety of respiratory and cardiovascular
diseases, besides combustion of (bio)gas creates much less pollution.
• Installation of water filtration systems in local communities.
Besides the preparation of food, fuelwood is often used to boil water, making it safe for
consumption. Water filtration systems have been installed in strategic places within the
project area. This will provide people with free access to clean water and further reduce
dependence on fuelwood.
The main driver of deforestation within the project area is slash-and-burn agriculture. Subsistence-
based farming is expected to remain to some extent throughout the crediting period.
Besides the activities described above, a number of activities have been implemented to improve
the health and well-being within the communities, such as periodical medical examinations, access

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
2 APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY
2.1 Title and Reference of Methodology
The following UNFFCC methodology and its related tools are utilised:
Approved consolidated baseline and monitoring methodology ACM0002 “Consolidated baseline
methodology for grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources.” Version 13.0.0.
The Approved Methodology refers to the following tools:
“Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality” (Version 06.0.0 )
“Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system”. (Version 02.2.1)
""Tool to calculate project or leakage CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion"" (Version 02).
2.2 Applicability of Methodology
The methodology ACM0002 (Version 13.0.0) is applicable to the proposed project activity
because the proposed project meets all the applicability criteria stated in the methodology:
The methodology is applicable under the following conditions:
• “The project activity is the installation, capacity addition, retrofit or replacement of a
power plant/unit of one of the following types: hydro power plant/unit (either with a run-
of-river reservoir or an accumulation reservoir), wind power plant/unit, geothermal power
plant/unit, solar power plant/unit, wave power plant/unit or tidal power plant/unit;
• In the case of capacity additions, retrofits or replacements (except for wind, solar, wave
or tidal power capacity addition projects which use Option 2 on page 10 (of the ACM0002
(version 13.0.0)). to calculate the parameter EGPJ,y): the existing plant started
commercial operation prior to the start of a minimum historical reference period of five
years, used for the calculation of baseline emissions and defined in the baseline emission
section, and no capacity expansion or retrofit of the plant has been undertaken between
the start of this minimum historical reference period and the implementation of the project
activity;”
The proposed project activity fits to first condition stated above as it is the installation of a new
power plant at a site where no renewable power plant was operated prior to the implementation of
the project activity (greenfield plant).
“In case of hydro power plants:
• One of the following conditions must apply:
v3.0 15

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
o The project activity is implemented in an existing single or multiple reservoirs, with no
change in the volume of any of reservoirs; or
o The project activity is implemented in an existing single or multiple reservoirs, where
the volume of any of reservoirs is increased and the power density of each reservoir,
as per the definitions given in the Project Emissions section, is greater than 4 W/m2;
or
o The project activity results in new single or multiple reservoirs and the power density
of each reservoir, as per the definitions given in the Project Emissions section, is
greater than 4 W/m2.”
In case of Kepezkaya HPP, there is only a weir that rises the water level to transfer the water to
the water conveying system. At the maximum operation level of 501.80 m water level the total
extend of the area that is flooded by river is 166,258.40 m2 therefore the power density is
calculated to be 168 W/m2, which is much greater than 4W/ m2.
“In case of hydro power plants using multiple reservoirs where the power density of any of the
reservoirs is lower than 4 W/m2 all the following conditions must apply:
• The power density calculated for the entire project activity using equation 5 (provided in
the methodology) is greater than 4 W/m2;
• Multiple reservoirs and hydro power plants located at the same river and where are
designed together to function as an integrated project that collectively constitute the
generation capacity of the combined power plant;
• Water flow between multiple reservoirs is not used by any other hydropower unit which is
not a part of the project activity;
• Total installed capacity of the power units, which are driven using water from the
reservoirs with power density lower than 4 W/m2, is lower than 15MW;
• Total installed capacity of the power units, which are driven using water from reservoirs
with power density lower than 4 W/m2, is less than 10% of the total installed capacity of
the project activity from multiple reservoirs.”
The proposed project activity does not have multiple reservoirs so the above conditions are not
applicable and the project activity is eligible.
“The methodology is not applicable to the following:
• Project activities that involve switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources at
the site of the project activity, since in this case the baseline may be the continued use of
fossil fuels at the site;
• Biomass fired power plants;
v3.0 16

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
• A hydro power plant that results in the creation of a new single reservoir or in the
increase in an existing single reservoir where the power density of the power plant is less
than 4 W/m2. “
The proposed project activity does not involve switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy
sources at the site of the project activity, is not a biomass fired plant, is not a hydro power plant
that results in the creation of a new single reservoir or in the increase in an existing single
reservoir where the power density of the power plant is less than 4 W/m2, there fore the project
activity is eligible to implement the ACM0002 version 13.0.0
“In the case of retrofits, replacements, or capacity additions, this methodology is only applicable if
the most plausible baseline scenario, as a result of the identification of baseline scenario, is “the
continuation of the current situation, i.e. to use the power generation equipment that was already
in use prior to the implementation of the project activity and undertaking business as usual
maintenance”.
The project is not a retrofit, replacement or capacity addition so the above condition is not
applicable,
In addition, Kepezkaya HPP meets the applicability conditions included in “Tool for the
demonstration and assessment of additionality” (Version 6.0.0) and “Tool to calculate the
emission factor for an electricity system” (Version 2.2.0) referred below, the following reasons
justify the applicability of the methodological tools:
• “Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality” (Version 6.0.0) is required to
apply for demonstrating and assessing the additionality of a project activity in ACM0002
(Version 13.0.0).
According to the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system” (Version 2.2.0),
“This tool may be applied to estimate the OM, BM and/or CM when calculating baseline
emissions for a project activity that substitutes grid electricity, i.e. where a project activity supplies
electricity to a grid.” Accordingly, Kepezkaya HPP will supply electricity to the Turkish National
Grid, and therefore this tool can be used to estimate the OM, BM and CM of calculating baseline
emissions.
2.3 Project Boundary
Table 5 exhibits the gases included in the project boundary. CO emission is included in the 2
baseline but the project activity does not emit any of the gases listed, in Table 5.
The project boundary includes net electricity generated and supplied to the Turkish national grid.
The internal consumption and the GHG due to the temporary use and burning of the diesel fuel
by the auxiliary power generators.

2.5.11 EmissionsTradingProgramsandOtherBindingLimits
There is a cap & trade scheme in China. However, China’s national emissions trading scheme (ETS),
whichisatitsveryearly stage,onlyincludes2,225fossilfuel-firedpowerplantsinthepowersector24,and
the project proponent is not included in the list. China’s ETS is expected to include all companies with
annual GHG emissions greater than 26,000 tCO e in eight emission-intensive industries including power 2
generation, petrochemicals, chemicals, building materials, non-ferrous metals, papermaking, steel and
aviation25. The industry of the project participant is business services, not the industry mentioned above
according to the business license. There is no any mandatory regulations on GHG emission cap for the
industry of agriculture as per the ""Interim Measures for Carbon Emissions Trading Management"" issued
by NDRC December of 201426 and the ""Management Measures for Carbon Emissions Trading (Trial)""
issued by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment in December of 202027. Therefore, it will not be
included in the national ETS; no emission cap will be enforced on the project proponent, nor can it
participate in carbon transactions in the national ETS. Hence, it is confirmed that the emission reductions
will not be double counted. The project will not seek to generate or has received any form of
environmental credits, and the GHG emission removals generated by the project will not be used for
complianceundersuchprogramsormechanisms.

2.5.15 DoubleCounting(G5.9)
The project proponent has signed the Declaration of No Double Counting Statement and Declaration of
not involved in other GHG scheme to ensure that the project will not apply for emission reduction credits
or labels under any other schemesother than VCS. Inaddition, the credits generated fromthe project will
be sold as offsets on VCS registry, the series number of the issued credits can be tracked to avoid any
potentialdoublecounting.

VCS Project Description Template
1. “This category comprises renewable energy generation units, such as
photovoltaics, hydro, tidal/wave, wind, geothermal and renewable biomass, that
supply electricity to and/or displace electricity from an electricity distribution system
that is or would have been supplied by at least one fossil fuel fired generating unit.”
The project activity involves the setting up of wind farms, i.e., renewable generating
units of cumulative generation capacity 7.5 MW to harness a renewable source of
energy (wind power potential) and export the generated electricity to the fossil fuel
dominated electricity generation and distribution system, i.e. the Southern Regional
Electricity Grid of India9. In the process, an equivalent quantum of electricity that
would have been generated by the grid in line with the grid electricity generation mix
is displaced by the project activity. The carbon intensity of the fossil-fuel dominated
generation mix of the grid is evident from the following break-up of various types of
energy sources constituting the grid-mix contributing electricity to the Southern Grid
system.
Table 7: Power Generation mix of southern regional grid of India
Source : Central Electricity authority10 as on 31/01/2009
*From Wind Energy Sources as on 30/09/200811
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
2. “If the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a
wind/diesel unit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small-scale CDM project activity
applies only to the renewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel, the
capacity of the entire unit shall not exceed the limit of 15MW”.
The project activity involves only wind power generation. The gross wind power
generation capacity of the bundled project activity is 7.60 MW, which is less than 15
MW, as stipulated in the applicability criterion under consideration.
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
3. “Combined heat and power (co-generation) systems are not eligible under
this category”
The project activity involves generation of electricity only through WTGs and is not a
co-generation system.
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
4. “In the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy
generation units at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added
capacity of the units added by the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be
physically distinct from the existing units.”
The project activity does not involve the addition of renewable energy generation
units at an existing renewable power generation facility.

Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
5. “Project activities that seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for
renewable energy generation are included in this category. To qualify as a small
scale project, the total output of the modified or retrofitted unit shall not exceed the
limit of 15 MW”
The renewable energy generating wind-farms employed by the project activity are
newly constructed set up and does not involve retrofitting or modification of any
existing facility for renewable energy generation.
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.

Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.1
The tool for demonstration and assessment of additionality provides a general framework
demonstrating and assessing additionality and is applicable to a wide range of project types. As
referred in the methodologies ACM0001, the additionality tool is applicable for the proposed
project activity.
Applicability of “Project emissions from flaring” Version 04.0
In line with ACM0001 “Flaring or Use of Landfill Gas” version 19.0.0”, the project activity is
eligible to claim emission reductions from its flaring activities. Within the project activity, there is
an enclosed flare system installed to flare any excess of LFG. However, the project participant
opts to exclude the flare system from the project boundary and will not claim any emission
reductions from the flaring activities (if any) within the crediting period, since the flare system is
observed/envisaged to work none or for insignificant durations throughout the operational
lifetime.
The exclusion of the emission reductions from flaring activities is conservative since it will result
in no change (if there is no flaring activity) or decrease in the total emission reductions (if flaring
activity is observed). In accordance with the above explanation, the “Project emissions from
flaring” version 04.0, is not applied to the proposed project activity and no emission reductions
will be claimed from the flaring activity throughout the crediting period.
Applicability of “Emissions from solid waste disposal sites"" Version 08.0
The tool provides procedures to calculate baseline, project or leakage emissions of methane from
solid waste disposed or prevented from disposal at a solid waste disposal site (SWDS). The tool
is applicable as the solid waste disposal site where the waste would be dumped can be clearly
identified and the proposed project is not a stockpile, and no hazardous waste is processed.
The applicability of the tool is discussed as follows:

functioning as a result of improved land and livestock management has positive impacts on important soil
health properties. Greater basal cover and grass production, for example, improves the water infiltration
rate, reduces the rate of overland water flow, increases soil moisture and water holding capacity, and
reduces the rate of soil erosion. This directly limits the rate of soil carbon losses from the system. Changes
to the grass species composition, including an increase in the proportion of perennial grass species,
increases the amount of lignin and cellulose fraction in the plant- and dung-derived carbon inputs. These
complex carbon structures are more persistent in the soil as they are resistant to microbial decomposition
and respiration losses, which results in greater permanence of the soil carbon stocks.
Methane emissions from enteric fermentation are reduced by improving the livestock production efficiency
and limiting the amount of energy wasted, as detailed by the IPCC (2019)31 and summarised below. Under
the baseline scenario, livestock are expending a significant portion of their energy intake on walking long
distances each day over vast areas to find sufficient forage material of sufficient quality, on digesting low-
quality forage, and on fighting diseases with poor overall animal health (Section 3.4). These factors all
contribute to the production of large amounts of methane emissions per head of livestock. This is further
exacerbated by the herd structure including a disproportionate number of old, unproductive livestock that
produce a greater methane emissions intensity per head and per kg of livestock product than younger,
productive livestock. Under the project scenario, herd health inputs and proactive health management
practices are implemented; livestock grazing is controlled allowing for sufficient, high quality forage intake
without needing to walk long distances; the herd structure is improved to be more productive and have a
lower emissions intensity; and the total methane emissions from the system is, therefore, reduced.
Livestock farming in South Africa can be broadly categorised as Communal Farming, and Private Sector
Farming. While the livestock grazing management activities implemented across the two categories will be
similar, the implementation approach will be tailored to the needs of the relevant stakeholders and local
context.
The project is not located within a jurisdiction covered by a jurisdictional REDD+ program.
For PI1: Drakensberg Sub-Escarpment Communal Land Stewardship the specific activities adopted by a
given community for a given year are negotiated and agreed upon on an annual basis with full, free, prior
and informed consent from all relevant parties and formalized in a stewardship agreement that is
recognized under South African law, including the Biodiversity Act (No. 10 of 2004)32. A summary of the
theory of change is presented in Figure 2 that articulates the planned project incentives, farmer activities,
project results and outcomes33. Given the gendered nature of livestock ownership, particular attention is
afforded to the inclusion of women in project activities, and decision-making processes. A tiered approach
based on grazing and fire management practices (Levels 1 to 4) with optional extensions (Green, Bronze,
Silver and Gold Stars) has been developed to provide a framework for advancing ambition and
correspondingly greater support and incentives for the activity implementation. The specific activities and
outcomes related to implementation of the various levels and star activities will be reported on in the
Monitoring Report at verification.

Project Description: VCS Version 4.1
There are several partner entities involved in the implementation of this grouped project (GP). The two
project proponents, TASC SA and Meat Naturally Africa, are responsible for oversight and coordination of
the GP implementation. Supporting them are several implementation and technical partners (See
Section 1.6). Implementation partners have an existing presence in the target landscape and are the
primary interface between the GP and the participating communities. The participating community
members, including farmers, Ecorangers and other participating members such as the fire management
committee members, receive training and ongoing technical support through a train-the-trainer approach
from Meat Naturally Africa and technical partners on the H4H model, project requirements and timelines,
technical background to the project activities and any other requirements that may arise. For the first
project instance, PI 1: Drakensberg Sub-Escarpment Communal Land Stewardship, these implementation
partners include Lima Rural Development Foundation34, the Institute of Natural Resources NPC35,
Conservation Outcomes36, and the African Habitat Conservancy Foundation37. Technical partners, who
have existing domain expertise in their field, provide technical support and/or training to the
implementation partners or directly to participating community members. These technical partners include
Afrivet38, who provide animal health products, knowledge and services, and the Herding Academy at the SA
College for Tourism39, who provide CATHSETA-accredited Ecoranger training on holistic herding practices
and livestock management. Project implementation and technical partners may change over the lifetime
of the project.
The design, negotiation, and adoption of the H4H model follows a participatory process with farmers and
other community groups, such as non-farmers, women and youth, to ensure that it is tailored and adaptable
to the specific needs of all affected parties and to the local context. The process of establishing the criteria
and the selection of Ecoranger candidates to be trained, for example, is led by farmers to ensure that they
are confident in the Ecoranger candidates that will be managing their resources and ultimately employed
by their association. The role of the Ecorangers is described in more detail under Section 1.11.1. Detailed
stakeholder engagements are facilitated by the relevant implementation partner for each target landscape
to ensure that the perspectives of all community groups are factored into the H4H implementation, not just
existing farming communities. Opportunities for broader participation of non-farmers are also identified and
advertised, such as in the community-based wildfire management committees and ecological restoration
teams.
1.11.1 Activity Tiers
The tiers listed below are intended as a ratcheting mechanism to accommodate for initial adoption of basic
improved management practices, with successively increasing ambition as the benefits of collective action
become evident. As described above, the levels of implementation are decided upon through a participatory
process between the proponent, the implementing partners, and the farmers. The annual level of
implementation agreed upon is reflected in the rangeland stewardship agreement. The level of
implementation and additional star system, where applicable, will be reported on for each project area for
that monitoring period.
Level 1: Rotational Rest and Fire Risk Reduction
The primary objective of this tier is to introduce seasonal rest into the grazing system, which allows the
ecosystem to recover from disturbance (grazing and fire), improve the grass forage quality, accumulate
phytomass, and establish more robust below-ground resources that stimulate the sequestration of SOC.
This is intended as an accessible tier that facilitates collective action by farmers, where little cooperation
was evident in the baseline scenario. The requirements and support related to sheep and goats also

XinJiang Makit County Afforestation Carbon Sequestration Project (here after “the project”) is
located in Makit County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China. The project’s aim is to
increase carbon sequestration and contribute to local sustainable development by planting trees
on the desert lands. The project proponent is Makit Base Junlian Cotton Industry Co., Ltd.
The project area is at the south-western edge of the Taklimakan Desert which is the biggest desert
in Asia. According to the baseline survey, before the implementation of the project, there was no
natural or secondary forest in the project area. According to the satellite pictures taken in 2002
(refer to Figure2-1) and official records of local government, the project area has been a desert for
more than a decade.
6,697.84 ha of forest is to be planted by direct planting on desert lands in Makit County, and the
planted trees are all native species (Populus alba var, Haloxylon ammodendron, Xanthoceras
sorbifolium Bunge, Elaeagnus angustifolia Linn, Lycium ruthenicum Murr). The implementation of
the afforestation project will generate GHG emission removals and improve the local environment,
enhance the capabilities of local communities and residents by providing them with relevant
technical skills and training, and increase local biodiversity as a result of establishing a forest of
native trees.
The project is estimated to generate GHG emission removals of 3,615,747 tCO2e in 40 years, with
an average annual GHG emission removal of 90,393 tCO2e.

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
In addition to the group meetings that took place on the dates referred to in the table listed
above, GAIA meets weekly with land owners/farmers, communicates with local stakeholders in
various ways, including E-mail, WhatsApp messaging and communication through letters sent
by postal delivery in cases of urgency through direct phone calls.
Different types of stakeholders (“Project Entities”) are affected by the activities of the proposed
project:
• farmers
• their communities
• their representatives
• local non-profit organization
Firstly, Ms. Capano Francesca presented the idea of the afforestation project in 2017. The
proposal was well received by farmers and it was approved by all project participants in the very
next months.
Subsequently, each Entity socialized the project in each community through participatory
meetings. Farmers willing to voluntarily participate in the project were registered for these
preliminary meetings. Each farmer concerned was then visited individually in order to assess
his/her land suitability, conduct a biophysical assessment of the area, determine planting
patterns and choice of bamboo species.
Since the project has been conceived and proposed in a participatory way, and since it is
managed by each Entity in a very cooperative way, any farmer may at any time give advice or

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
In facts, farmers shall properly use a “Farmer Journal” (a register of farming activities) where
he/she not only annotates all farming activities carries out each week, but also collects his/her
suggestions and commentaries he/she wants to share and/or address with Gaia and the rest of
project entities.
The stakeholder meeting took place in stages from 10 May 2017, 21 June 2019, 30 June 2019,
02 July 2019, 04 April 2020, 21 April 2020, 30 April 2020 in different parts of the Calabria and
Lombardy region.
The project proposer explained the process to stakeholders and community members regarding
the validation and verification of the VCS programme and the on-site visit of the
validation/verification body. The project proposer requested all the collaboration of VVB
stakeholders during the validation process.
Summary of comments received:
The project is generally well accepted:
• Farmers are proud to be part of a climate change mitigation program
• Farmers are grateful for this help or for reforesting their lands
• Farmers are grateful for the additional and diversified incomes they canuse for their
children's retirement or education.
• Producers have also expressed their interest in the possibility of developing carbon
sequestration projects. The project will help them to enter this new market.
• In general terms, since they had not ever been involved in a bamboo cultivation, Farmers
inputs and feedbacks has become more relevant and functional once the plantations
started to be operational. As an example, a farmer in Montemilone plantation (approx. 20
ha.) wrote on the Farmer Journal that it was very beneficial to use a given fertilizer (multi-
feed 20.20.20) to strengthen bamboo roots during early growth periods. This suggestion
was firstly verified by Gaia and eventually shared with and promoted to all other farmers
involved in the project.
Some doubts or requests were taken into consideration:
A. Will a truly efficient monitoring process be implemented? (Have heard of or known about other
projects led by other entities that did not includeor long-term follow-up)
B. Will farmers receive training on agroforestry and forestry grassland?
C. Farmers have requested the planting of other species
In the development of the project, all these questions were taken into account:
69

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
• A monitoring plan has been developed and the cooperative is strongly aware that long-term
monitoring is crucial for the development and permanence of the project.
• Farmers will receive training courses as detailed in the farmers' training plan.
• The choice was made in accordance with the choice of the farmers, the availability of the
seedlings, the availability on the market of the bamboo wood.
Q. How farmers will fight against pests?
A. There is no universal solution to combat the pest. But the good practices of silvicultural
prevention that will be taught to the farmer, allow to prevent the infestation of the parcels. The
project coordinator or forestry engineer responsible for training farmers will continue to seek
solutions and inform farmers.

234,methodology,"2.2 Applicability of Methodology
This methodology is applicable under the following conditions:
a) The land subject to the project activity does not fall in wetland category;
It is demonstrated with the Land Use Research that all the plantations of the project activity does
not fall in the wetland category, so the project activity is in line with the first applicability condition.
b) Soil disturbance attributable to the afforestation and reforestation (A/R) clean development
mechanism project activity does not cover more than 10 percent of area in each of the
following types of land, when these lands are included within the project boundary:
i. Land containing organic soils;
No land disturbance will be attributable to the project area as a part of the project activity; the land
preparation for the plantation includes digging methods ad follows:
 The spacing (not disturbance area) between the trees according Proteak Forestry
Management Plan has to scenarios:
o Lower tree density: 890 trees/ha with and spacing of 3.5 meters (row) and 3.2
meters (columns). The spacing area is 11.2 square meters that means that the
spacing area per ha is 9968 square meters (99.68% of not disturbance area).
o Higher tree density: 1111 trees/ha with and spacing of 3.0 meters (row) and 3.0
meters (columns). The spacing area is 9 square meters that means that the
spacing area per ha is 9999 square meters (99.99% of not disturbance area).
With this information the PP demonstrate that the project is in line with the applicability condition.
ii. Land which, in the baseline, is subject to land-use and management practices and receives
inputs listed in appendices 1 and 2 to this methodology.
The appendix 1 doesn’t apply to the project activity due to the project activity plantations don’t
falls in cropland category.
v3.2 26

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
The project activity is taking place in land that doesn’t fall in the land management practices and
inputs listed in appendix 2 of the methodology.
As for appendix 2, grassland, the project activity is developed in tropical wet areas where
grasslands are degraded and no inputs are applied.
The “Tool for the identification of degraded or degrading lands for consideration in implementing
A/R CDM project activities” Version 1 has been applied to demonstrate that the lands are
degraded or degrading.
Stage 1 of the tool requires the PP to screen the lands of the project to determine whether the
area has been classified as “degraded” under any verifiable local, regional, national or
international land classification system or credible study produced within the last ten years.
In this case is used the report of SEMARNAT (Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources)
18 report is used; it demonstrates the soil degradation of the country . The maps 3-2 (page 118), 3-
3 (page 119) and 3-4 (122), show that the regions of the project activity falls in the category of
19 degraded and the cause of the degradation is overgrazing .
The project activity also complies with the applicability conditions of the tool contained in the
methodology AR-ACM0003 version 1.0.0. In some cases there are tools that don’t have any
applicability conditions therefore are not described below. In general, the project activity complies
with all the applicability conditions of all the tools involved with the methodology AR-ACM0003
version 1.0.0.
Tools applicability conditions related to the project activity
 The tool for “Estimation of the increase in GHG emissions attributable to displacement of
pre-project agricultural activities in A/R CDM project activity” Version 01, mentions that
the tool is not applicable if the displacement of agricultural activities attributable to the
project activity is expected to cause any drainage of wetlands or peat lands. The project
activity does not fall in wetland region; therefore this applicable condition doesn’t apply to
the project activity.
The tool for “Estimation of non-CO2 GHG emissions resulting from burning of biomass
attributable to an A/R CDM project activity” mentions the following applicability condition:
Non-CO2 GHG emissions resulting from any occurrence of fire within the project
boundary shall be accounted for each incidence of fire which affects an area greater than
the minimum threshold area reported by the host Party for the purpose of defining forest,
provided that the accumulated area affected by such fires in a given year is ≥5% of the
project area.
In the case of an incident occurs the previous tool will apply to the emission reductions
calculation.
In summary the project activity is in line with the applicability conditions:
 The project does not fall in a wetland category (according the Land Use Research by FSI
Servicios Técnicos Forestales y Ambientales).
 The soil disturbance is less than 10% as was demonstrated.
 Additionally, none of the plantations fall in the categories shown in the Table 2 of the
methodology.
 The project activity is in line with the applicability conditions of all the tools.

The selected methodology AR-ACM0003 Version 02.0 is applicable since the project meets the following
conditions:
Condition 01
The land subject to the project activity does not fall in wetland category.
Applicability
The lands belonging to the project activity were degraded lands where agriculture had been
practiced and lands left abandoned without any activity. Therefore, the land does not fall in wetland
category.
Condition 02
Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10 percent of area in
each of the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project boundary:
i. Land containing organic soils;
ii. Land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and
receives inputs listed in appendices 1 and 2 to referred methodology.
28

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
Applicability
The land subjected to the project activity does not contain organic soil and there were no intense
land management practices carried out before the project. Therefore, this condition is not
applicable.
A project activity applying this methodology shall also comply with the applicability conditions of the tools
contained within the methodology and applied by the project activity.
The Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality in A/R CDM project
activities” (Version 01) is applicable under the following conditions:
Condition 01
Forestation of the land within the proposed project boundary performed with or without being
registered as the A/R CDM project activity shall not lead to violation of any applicable law even if
the law is not enforced.
Applicability
The project activity described in the document does not lead to violation of any applicable law as
outlined in Section 1.14 even if the law is not enforced.
Condition 02
This tool is not applicable to large-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities.
Applicability
Large-scale A/R CDM project are defined as A/R activities “where the average projected net
anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks for each verification period do not exceed eight kilotonnes
of carbon dioxide equivalent per year; and which is developed or implemented by low-income
communities and individuals as determined by the host Party”18. This project will generate more
than eight kilotonnes of carbon dioxide annually and therefore is not a large-scale project.
A/R Methodological Tool “Estimation of non-CO2 GHG emissions resulting from burning of biomass
attributable to an A/R CDM project activity” (Version 04.0.0).

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
Proper fire preventive measures have been applied by PP however in case there is an outbreak of
fire, such fire will be reported, and non-CO2 GHG emissions shall be reported. Hence this tool is
applicable.
Condition 02
Non-CO2 GHG emissions resulting from any occurrence of fire within the project boundary shall be
accounted for each incidence of fire which affects an area greater than the minimum threshold
area reported by the host Party for the purpose of defining forest, provided that the accumulated
area affected by such fires in a given year is ≥ 5% of the project area.
Applicability
Non-CO2 GHG emissions resulting due to site preparation shall be accounted under the above
condition 02 hence applicability criteria have been met. Borders of the plantation is scheduled for
clean up before the start of the dry season to mitigate the risk of fire outbreak. Fire hazard will be
monitored continuously.

A/R Methodological Tool “Estimation of the increase in GHG emissions attributable to displacement of pre-
project agricultural activities in A/R CDM project activity” (Version 02.0)
Condition
This tool is not applicable if the displacement of agricultural activities attributable to the A/R CDM
project activity is expected to cause any drainage of wetlands or peatlands.
Applicability
The lands belonging to the project activity were degraded lands and left abandoned without any
activity. Thus, the project activity does not lead to a shift of pre-project activity out-side the project
boundary. Thus, the project activity does not lead to a shift of pre-project activity out-side the project

through the substation “Estación Francisco Veira” annexed to the park.
The power plant will have an expected operating life of 20 years and will displace a total amount
of 190,500 MW·h/year from the national power grid, generating, on average, annual emission
reductions of 109,818 tCO and amounting to 1,098,180 tCO for first crediting period. 2 2
The proposed project activity consists of the installation and operation of a new grid connected
