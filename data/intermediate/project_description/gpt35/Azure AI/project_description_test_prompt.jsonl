Out of three Boilers, one boiler with 25 TPH capacities will be kept (as\nstandby) with project boilers and other two boilers had completed their lifetime and hence will be de-\ninstalled. Coal was consumed in the pre-project activity scenario for thermal (steam) and electrical\nenergy generation and use in industrial process.\nProject Scenario\nThe project activity entails installation of a cogeneration unit consisting of a 50 TPH boiler and a\n6.94 MW steam turbine to generate both steam and power in an existing processing unit based on\nrice husk. A 25 TPH old boiler will be kept as standby.\nThe estimated annual average emission reductions due to the project activity are 116,832 tCO2e\nand the total GHG emission reductions for the fixed crediting period of 10 years is 1,168,320 tCO2e.\n1.11 Compliance with Laws, Statutes and Other Regulatory Frameworks\nThe project is in compliance with relevant laws, statues and other regulatory frameworks. The\nproject does not violate any laws, statutes and or other regulatory frameworks in Punjab, India\n1.12 Ownership and Other Programs\n1.12.1 Project Ownership\nThe ownership of project activity to the project proponent can be verified through following\ndocuments from the government-authorised bodies.\n\u2022 Commissioning Certificate\n\u2022 Power Purchase Agreement\n\u2022 Energy generation statement issued by state electricity board\n\u2022 Invoices\n1.12.2 Emissions Trading Programs and Other Binding Limits\nThe net GHG emission reductions generated by the project activity will not be used for compliance\nwith an emissions trading program or to meet binding limits on GHG emissions.\n1.12.3 Other Forms of Environmental Credit\nThe project proponent hereby corroborates that the project activity has not created or sought or\nreceived any other form of environmental credit.\n1.12.4 Participation under Other GHG Programs\nProject has been registered under CDM with the registered Project Id 9771.\n1.12.5 Projects Rejected by Other GHG Programs\nThe project has not been rejected by any other GHG program\n1.13 Additional Information Relevant to the Project\nEligibility Criteria\nNot Applicable\nv3.3 9","groundtruth":"{'project_name': 'Renewable Energy Generation at Hamira', 'project_summary': 'The project activity entails installation of a cogeneration unit consisting of a 50 TPH boiler and a 6.94 MW steam turbine to generate both steam and power in an existing processing unit based on rice husk.

Without the project, there would be no ditches, pumps,\nvalves, and reservoirs to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously\nflooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was cultivated by the\ncontinuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under\nflooded conditions can emit a large amount of methane because of anaerobic decomposition,\nthe intermittently flooded method is more conducive to saving water, increasing rice yield, and\nreducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.\nThe implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir\nconstruction, pumps and valves installation, training, etc. According to the needs of rice growth,\nfarmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water\nresources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic\nconditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice\npaddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in\nthe rainy season. In this case, the methane emission can be declined by an average of 48%.\nHence, with the proposed project activity, the estimated GHG reduction from rice is 4.93\ntCO e\/ha. 2\nThe project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions by 418,012 tCO e in the first seven-year 2\nperiod, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 59,716 tCO e.

The end-user technology in the case of this project can be\nestablished as the project proponent, who utilizes the thermal energy\ngenerated by the new renewable energy technology.\nThere are no similar registered small-scale CDM project activities in the\nregion of Presidente Prudente once Social Carbon Company made a research and\ndid not find any registered small\u2013scale CDM Project activity in the region.\nThe sources of registered small-scale CDM project activity consulted were the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 14 and\nBrazilian\u2019s Technology and Science Ministry15. Therefore, the proposed project\nactivity is not saving the non-renewable biomass accounted by the other\nregistered project activities.\nThe utilization of firewood from area without any kind of management can not\nbe considered a renewable source of biomass, since it involves a decrease of\ncarbon pools and increases the carbon emissions to the atmosphere, turning\ngreen house effect even worse. Moreover, the native wood provided from areas\nwithout a reforestation management plan does not fit any of the options of\nUNFCCC definition of renewable biomass in Annex 18, EB 23.\nFurthermore, firewood has been used for many decades as fuel in Brazil16.\nAlthough, it is impossible to define a start date on which this kind of non-\nrenewable biomass began to be applied, there are many documents to prove that\nwood has been used for thermal energy generation before 1989 as requested in\nthe applied methodology.

Category AMS-I.E: Switch from Non\u2013Renewable Biomass for Thermal\nApplications by the User \u2013 Version 01 from February 01 of 2008 onwards.\nThe amount of non-renewable biomass (B ) will be determined according to the y\noption \u201cb\u201d of the applied methodology once option \u201ca\u201d is designed for really\nsmall appliances like household stoves and does not fit for the kind of\nprojects in question.\nThe project\u2019s emissions from the combustion of native wood are accounted in\nthe same way as fossil fuel combustion, once it is not renewable and emits\nCO . 2\n2.2 Justification of the choice of the methodology and\nwhy it is applicable to the project activity:\nThe methodology applied is Category AMS-I.E: Switch from Non\u2013Renewable\nBiomass for Thermal Applications by the User \u2013 Version 01 from February 01 of\n2008 onwards which is applicable for project activities that avoid greenhouse\ngas emissions by using renewable biomass in order to generate thermal energy.\nThis category comprises small thermal appliances that displace the use of\nnon-renewable biomass by introducing new renewable energy end-user\ntechnologies. The end-user technology in the case of this project can be\nestablished as the project proponent, who utilizes the thermal energy\ngenerated by the new renewable energy technology.\nThere are no similar registered small-scale CDM project activities in the\nregion of Presidente Prudente once Social Carbon Company made a research and\ndid not find any registered small\u2013scale CDM Project activity in the region.\nThe sources of registered small-scale CDM project activity consulted were the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 14 and\nBrazilian\u2019s Technology and Science Ministry15. Therefore, the proposed project\nactivity is not saving the non-renewable biomass accounted by the other\nregistered project activities.\nThe utilization of firewood from area without any kind of management can not\nbe considered a renewable source of biomass, since it involves a decrease of\ncarbon pools and increases the carbon emissions to the atmosphere, turning\ngreen house effect even worse. Moreover, the native wood provided from areas\nwithout a reforestation management plan does not fit any of the options of\nUNFCCC definition of renewable biomass in Annex 18, EB 23.\nFurthermore, firewood has been used for many decades as fuel in Brazil16.\nAlthough, it is impossible to define a start date on which this kind of non-\nrenewable biomass began to be applied, there are many documents to prove that\nwood has been used for thermal energy generation before 1989 as requested in\nthe applied methodology. Firewood used to be the most employed source of\nprimary energy until de decade of 1970, when the petroleum started to supply\n14 CDM activities registered by CDM Executive board are Available at:<\nhttp:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/Projects\/registered.html>. visited on May 11th, 2009.\n15 Brazilian\u00b4s Technology and Science Ministry is responsible for registry and approval\nof all CDM activities within Brazilian boundaries.

From 2007 - 2012, Farm\nAfrica\/ SOS Sahel Ethiopia in partnership with the Oromia Forest and Wildlife Enterprise implemented the\nBale Eco-Region Sustainable Management Programme (BERSMP), supported by the Netherlands,\nNorwegian and Irish Embassies in Ethiopia. The programme aimed to contribute to the conservation and\nsustainable development of the unique biodiversity and ecological functions of the greater Bale Mountains\nEco-region, whilst establishing and enhancing sustainable local livelihoods. The idea was to involve local\ncommunities into a central role in the sustainable management of the area, and as the natural resource\nmanagement leaders, supported by government services, across the whole Bale Massif. The Bale\nMountains Eco-Region REDD+ initiative started as part of the bigger programme to address the financial\nsustainability of the programme.\nFigure 13.

Ngari is located in the southwest border of\nChina, the west of Tibet Autonomous Region and the north of Qinghai Tibet Plateau (Qiangtang\nplateau). The objective of the project is to restore the \"black soil beach14\" and degraded\ngrassland ecosystem through reseeding native grasses and grazing management, such as rest\ngrazing and grazing prohibition, increase carbon sequestration, and promote local development.\nThe project proponent is National Forestry and Grassland Administration Northwest Investigation\nand Planning Institute.\nThe project area is located in Ngari, covering Gar County, Burang County, Zanda County, Rutog\nCounty, G\u00ea'gyai County, G\u00earz\u00ea County and Coq\u00ean County. According to the Participatory Rural\nAppraisal (PRA) report. Before the implementation of the project, there were severely degradation\nand desertification of the grasslands in this area due to the impact of climate change and human\nactivities, some grassland even degenerated into \"black soil beach\", the excellent forages in the\nplant community almost disappeared, and the natural reproduction and renewal ability was very\nlow. According to the Parameters for Degradation, Desertification and Salinization of Rangeland\n(GB19377-2003) in China15, moderately degraded grassland areas refer to the total grass yield\ndecreased by 21%-50% compared with that before degradation and the total grass yield\ndecreased by more than 50% compared with that before degradation is regarded as severely\ndegraded grasslands.\nTotally, 373,467.02 ha of degraded grassland in Ngari have been managed sustainably including\nrest grazing and grazing prohibition by fence building and seeding of local high-quality forage.\nThere are three main restoration measures as followed in the project:\n(1) Rest grazing was implemented in moderately degraded grassland areas where grass yield\nwas 130-190kg\/Mu 16 which decreased by 21-50% compared with the non-degraded\ngrassland. It is required that grazing shall not be allowed within 120 days when the grass\nturns green every year (from 01-May to 31-August) through the construction of fence and\nsustainable management. Through the implementation of rest grazing, 322,770.02 ha of\ndegraded grassland were managed sustainably.\n(2) Grazing prohibition was implemented in seriously degraded grasslands where grass yield\nless than 130 Kg\/Mu which decreased by more than 50% compared with the non-degraded\ngrassland. Fence building shall be carried out in the grazing prohibition area. When the\nconstruction is completed, grazing prohibition shall be implemented for 5 years. After that,\n14 \"Black soil beach\" is an extreme type of grassland degradation caused by overgrazing, human factors, rat and\ninsect damage, climate warming and other factors.\n15GB19377-2003 is a national standard document of the people's Republic of China which issued by The Ministry of\nAgriculture and Rural Affairs to assess the level of degradation, desertification and salinization of natural grassland.\nThe original website of the standard is\nhttp:\/\/c.gb688.cn\/bzgk\/gb\/showGb?type=online&hcno=5F1960D0692A36C09136E04E6DE60B4E\n16 1ha=15 Mu\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 9\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nunder the premise of not affecting the normal growth of the improved grassland, the\ngrassland should be used reasonably and sustainably according to the local approved\nlivestock carrying capacity. For the project, totally 40,801.00 ha of degraded grassland have\nbeen managed sustainably by grazing prohibition.\n(3) Black soil beach restoration was implemented in moderately degraded grassland areas\nwhere grass yield was less than 150 Kg\/Mu and the proportion of bare patches in grassland\nexceeds 40% which decreased by 21%-50% compared with the non-degraded grassland.\nReseeding grass, scientific fertilization and irrigation are carried out to restore grassland\nvegetation greatly based on rodent and pest control on the \"black soil beach\" degraded\ngrassland in the project area. After reseeding the grass, the project area needs to be fenced\nfor 3 years to better restore grassland vegetation. Then under the premise of not affecting the\nnormal growth of the improved grassland, the grassland should be used reasonably and\nsustainably according to the local approved livestock carrying capacity. The grass seeds\nsowed were local high-quality forage such as Elymus nutans (Drooping tassel grass). In the\nproject, 9,896.00 ha of \"black soil\" degraded grassland have been reseeded grass.\nIn addition to these main restoration measures, the project also alleviates soil desertification and\nrestores grassland vegetation through grassland management measures to improve soil carbon\nstorage and local biodiversity, supplemented by daily management measures of other protection\nprojects, such as grassland fire prevention and rodent control, so as to ensure long-term\nsustainable management of the project area. The project is estimated to generate GHG emission\nremovals of 11,698,413 tCO e in 40 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 2\n292,460 tCO e. 2\nThe objectives of the project including:\nClimate: Restore the degraded grassland ecosystem, increase grassland coverage, increase\ngrassland carbon sink function and reduce GHG emissions.\nCommunity: Improve the livelihood of local herders, provide permanent and temporary job\nopportunities for them, increase their income. Provide technical skills and training in sustainable\ngrassland management. Protect the sacred mountains (Kang Rinpoche) and holy waters (Lake\nManasarovar) widely respected by the Tibetan people which is conducive to the protection and\ndevelopment of Tibet's traditional Zhangzhung culture. Zhangzhung culture is the traditional\nculture of the Tibetan people, also known as the basic culture of Tibet. The traces of ancient\nZhangzhung culture run through all aspects of Tibet. From production to life, from folk custom17 to\nbelief, there is the shadow of Zhangzhung culture everywhere.

Ngari is located in the southwest border of\nChina, the west of Tibet Autonomous Region and the north of Qinghai Tibet Plateau (Qiangtang\nplateau). The objective of the project is to restore the \"black soil beach14\" and degraded\ngrassland ecosystem through reseeding native grasses and grazing management, such as rest\ngrazing and grazing prohibition, increase carbon sequestration, and promote local development.\nThe project proponent is National Forestry and Grassland Administration Northwest Investigation\nand Planning Institute.\nThe project area is located in Ngari, covering Gar County, Burang County, Zanda County, Rutog\nCounty, G\u00ea'gyai County, G\u00earz\u00ea County and Coq\u00ean County. According to the Participatory Rural\nAppraisal (PRA) report. Before the implementation of the project, there were severely degradation\nand desertification of the grasslands in this area due to the impact of climate change and human\nactivities, some grassland even degenerated into \"black soil beach\", the excellent forages in the\nplant community almost disappeared, and the natural reproduction and renewal ability was very\nlow. According to the Parameters for Degradation, Desertification and Salinization of Rangeland\n(GB19377-2003) in China15, moderately degraded grassland areas refer to the total grass yield\ndecreased by 21%-50% compared with that before degradation and the total grass yield\ndecreased by more than 50% compared with that before degradation is regarded as severely\ndegraded grasslands.\nTotally, 373,467.02 ha of degraded grassland in Ngari have been managed sustainably including\nrest grazing and grazing prohibition by fence building and seeding of local high-quality forage.\nThere are three main restoration measures as followed in the project:\n(1) Rest grazing was implemented in moderately degraded grassland areas where grass yield\nwas 130-190kg\/Mu 16 which decreased by 21-50% compared with the non-degraded\ngrassland. It is required that grazing shall not be allowed within 120 days when the grass\nturns green every year (from 01-May to 31-August) through the construction of fence and\nsustainable management. Through the implementation of rest grazing, 322,770.02 ha of\ndegraded grassland were managed sustainably.\n(2) Grazing prohibition was implemented in seriously degraded grasslands where grass yield\nless than 130 Kg\/Mu which decreased by more than 50% compared with the non-degraded\ngrassland. Fence building shall be carried out in the grazing prohibition area. When the\nconstruction is completed, grazing prohibition shall be implemented for 5 years. After that,\n14 \"Black soil beach\" is an extreme type of grassland degradation caused by overgrazing, human factors, rat and\ninsect damage, climate warming and other factors.\n15GB19377-2003 is a national standard document of the people's Republic of China which issued by The Ministry of\nAgriculture and Rural Affairs to assess the level of degradation, desertification and salinization of natural grassland.\nThe original website of the standard is\nhttp:\/\/c.gb688.cn\/bzgk\/gb\/showGb?type=online&hcno=5F1960D0692A36C09136E04E6DE60B4E\n16 1ha=15 Mu\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 9\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nunder the premise of not affecting the normal growth of the improved grassland, the\ngrassland should be used reasonably and sustainably according to the local approved\nlivestock carrying capacity. For the project, totally 40,801.00 ha of degraded grassland have\nbeen managed sustainably by grazing prohibition.\n(3) Black soil beach restoration was implemented in moderately degraded grassland areas\nwhere grass yield was less than 150 Kg\/Mu and the proportion of bare patches in grassland\nexceeds 40% which decreased by 21%-50% compared with the non-degraded grassland.\nReseeding grass, scientific fertilization and irrigation are carried out to restore grassland\nvegetation greatly based on rodent and pest control on the \"black soil beach\" degraded\ngrassland in the project area. After reseeding the grass, the project area needs to be fenced\nfor 3 years to better restore grassland vegetation. Then under the premise of not affecting the\nnormal growth of the improved grassland, the grassland should be used reasonably and\nsustainably according to the local approved livestock carrying capacity. The grass seeds\nsowed were local high-quality forage such as Elymus nutans (Drooping tassel grass). In the\nproject, 9,896.00 ha of \"black soil\" degraded grassland have been reseeded grass.\nIn addition to these main restoration measures, the project also alleviates soil desertification and\nrestores grassland vegetation through grassland management measures to improve soil carbon\nstorage and local biodiversity, supplemented by daily management measures of other protection\nprojects, such as grassland fire prevention and rodent control, so as to ensure long-term\nsustainable management of the project area. The project is estimated to generate GHG emission\nremovals of 11,698,413 tCO e in 40 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 2\n292,460 tCO e. 2\nThe objectives of the project including:\nClimate: Restore the degraded grassland ecosystem, increase grassland coverage, increase\ngrassland carbon sink function and reduce GHG emissions.\nCommunity: Improve the livelihood of local herders, provide permanent and temporary job\nopportunities for them, increase their income. Provide technical skills and training in sustainable\ngrassland management. Protect the sacred mountains (Kang Rinpoche) and holy waters (Lake\nManasarovar) widely respected by the Tibetan people which is conducive to the protection and\ndevelopment of Tibet's traditional Zhangzhung culture. Zhangzhung culture is the traditional\nculture of the Tibetan people, also known as the basic culture of Tibet. The traces of ancient\nZhangzhung culture run through all aspects of Tibet. From production to life, from folk custom17 to\nbelief, there is the shadow of Zhangzhung culture everywhere. For example, religious activities\nsuch as offering sacrifices to mountain gods and turning mountains18 are all derived from the\nZhangzhung culture.\nBiodiversity: Provide more suitable habitats for wild animals and increase local biodiversity.\n17 The ancient Zhangzhung Buddha dharma occupies the supreme position in the traditional culture of ancient\nZhangzhung culture.

The\nimplementation of grouped project activity ensures energy security, diversification of the grid\ngeneration mix and sustainable growth of the electricity generation sector in Colombia.\nAll project activity instances within this grouped project activity will consist of single solar\nrenewable technology. Also, an individual project activity instance will either be small-scale\n(having methodology AMS I.D version 18.0) or large-scale (having methodology ACM0002\nversion 19.0).\nBefore the implementation of the project activity, no power plants were installed at the project\nsite. The energy that will be generated by the grouped project is currently dispatched by other\npower plants that are connected to the national grid, and that include fossil fuel power plants.\nHence, the baseline scenario and the scenario prior to project implementation are the same and\nthe project will help to reduce thermal power generation in the National Interconnected System\n(SIN1) by providing renewable energy to the grid.\nThe first phase of the solar grouped project will have a total installed capacity of 229.45 MW, with\nthe installation of 742,289 Solar Photovoltaic units. The electricity generated by the grouped\nproject is expected to be around 447.09 GWh per year, which will be delivered to the SIN, to a\nthird party, or represents a project activity that results in savings of electricity that would have\nbeen provided by the grid; avoiding part of the electricity generated by the grid-connected power\nplants. Thus, it will contribute to sustainability by increasing the share of renewable energy and\nreducing GHG emissions.\nAll the project activity instances i.e. renewable energy generation of Solar Photovoltaic \u2013 SPV\nplants to be included in this grouped project, will be within Colombia only (see Table 1). Hence\nthe location and geographical boundary of the grouped project can be defined as Colombia. The\nestimated annual emission reductions over a 10-year period of first crediting period from initial 6\nproject activity instances are 79,870 tCO e\/year.

The nominal installed capacity of each turbine is 75 MW, with a resulting total installed capacity of 150 MW  and an expected average annual power generation of 932,400  MWh. The planned operational starting date will be on 01 May 2 017 and the project is fully authorised by the respective national authoritiesThe project is located in the San Pedro River, about 14.5 km downstream from the drain of Lake Ri\u00f1ihue, in Valdivia province in Los R\u00edos Region .The electricity generated is delivered to the Central Interconnected System (Sistema Interconectado Central \u2013 SIC) in the Substation Los Ciruelos located in the area of San Jos\u00e9 de la Mariquina, through a  220 kV power transmission line with a length of 40 km .The project activity is considered as Sectoral Scope 1, Energy Industries (renewableon renewable sources), as consists in the installation of a new grid-connected renewable power plant, then the baseline scenario is the following: Electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as reflected in the combined margin (CM) calculations described in the \u201cTool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system\u201d (version 03.0.0, EB70). The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation of the project activity.The need to incorporate and use new technologies in all of energy areas, allows maintaining a parallel and efficient development to meet the requirement of different production areas of the country. In this context, and considering that hydropower use a renewable and non-polluting resource, and that does not depend on foreign issues, this project is presented as a convenient alternative to avoid the energy dependence on other countries and some of environmental problems, such as climate change.The energy generated by this project activity, will be produced from environmentally safe and sound technology of hydroelectricity generation equipment designed, engineered and manufactured by a respected supplier. Any of trusted manufacturers are then, going to transfer to the Host Party its know-how by means of training the power plant staff during the construction, commissioning and operation of the project activity.The implementation of this hydropower project will displace the dispatch of thermoelectric power plants currently operating in the system and will contribute with greenhouse gases (GHG) emission reductions, specifically by avoiding the emissions of CO2 produced by the combustion of fossil fuels, delivering clean energy to the grid that would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources. Thus, the expected annual emission reduction of the project activity is 610,724 tCO2.In addition, San Pedro Hydropower Plant diversifies the energy pool through the implementation of renewable energy sources helping to reduce Chile's dependence on natural gas coming from Argentina and other countries and to supply the progressive increase in the energy sector demand, which has grown strongly in recent years, thus contributing with the sustainable development of the country.\", 'project_state_province': 'Valdivia province in Los R\u00edos Region', 'project_country': 'Chile', 'project_latitude': -39.75, 'project_longitude': -72.58}"}

According with section 2.1 of\nthe VCS Standard (V 4.7), the activities of the project are not excluded.\nAFOLU project eligibility\nAccording to the VCS Standard V 4.7, eligible REDD activities are those that reduce net GHG emissions\nby reducing deforestation and\/or degradation of forests, which is the case of the KA'A PYAHU REDD+\nproject. Deforestation is the direct, human-induced conversion of forestland to non-forest land.\nThe analysis of land use categories in the project is based mainly on Mapbiomas2 which utilizes a satellite\nimagery dataset used composed by Landsat 5 (Thematic Mapper), Landsat 7 (Enhanced Thematic\nMapper Plus) and Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager), Landsast sensors. The MapBiomas classification\nscheme is a hierarchical system with a combination of LULC classes compatible with the Food and\nAgriculture Organization (FAO) and IBGE classification systems (Souza, et al., 2020). In this regard, the\nproject meets the internationally accepted definition of forest, and was qualified as forest for a minimum\nof 10 years before the project start date. The definition of forest may include mature forests, secondary\nforests, and degraded forests.\nAccording with the VCS standard, activities covered under the REDD project category are those that are\ndesigned to stop planned (designated and sanctioned) deforestation or unplanned (unsanctioned)\ndeforestation and\/or degradation.

Sectoral scope and type of the KA\u2019A PYAHU REDD+ Project\n1.4 Project Eligibility\nGeneral eligibility\nThe KA'A PYAHU REDD+ project is eligible under the scope of the VCS program for responding to REDD+\nactivities, under an independent project scheme for the validation and verification of GHG emission\nreductions in accordance with ISO 14064-2:2019 and ISO 14064-3: 2019. According with section 2.1 of\nthe VCS Standard (V 4.7), the activities of the project are not excluded.\nAFOLU project eligibility\nAccording to the VCS Standard V 4.7, eligible REDD activities are those that reduce net GHG emissions\nby reducing deforestation and\/or degradation of forests, which is the case of the KA'A PYAHU REDD+\nproject. Deforestation is the direct, human-induced conversion of forestland to non-forest land.\nThe analysis of land use categories in the project is based mainly on Mapbiomas2 which utilizes a satellite\nimagery dataset used composed by Landsat 5 (Thematic Mapper), Landsat 7 (Enhanced Thematic\nMapper Plus) and Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager), Landsast sensors. The MapBiomas classification\nscheme is a hierarchical system with a combination of LULC classes compatible with the Food and\nAgriculture Organization (FAO) and IBGE classification systems (Souza, et al., 2020). In this regard, the\nproject meets the internationally accepted definition of forest, and was qualified as forest for a minimum\nof 10 years before the project start date. The definition of forest may include mature forests, secondary\nforests, and degraded forests.\nAccording with the VCS standard, activities covered under the REDD project category are those that are\ndesigned to stop planned (designated and sanctioned) deforestation or unplanned (unsanctioned)\ndeforestation and\/or degradation. In this context, as described in section 1.9, the actions carried out in\nthe KA'A PYAHU REDD+ project, with the creation of the association, are oriented towards the defense,\npreservation and conservation of the environment. Specifically, by taking action to combat the\nenvironmental and social impacts caused by the construction of the power line. This project activity stops\nunplanned deforestation and reduces GHG emissions by stopping deforestation of forests.\nAFOLU project eligibility\n2 https:\/\/brasil.mapbiomas.org\/atbd---entenda-cada-etapa\/\n8","groundtruth":"{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}"}

Details are provided in section 1.13 of the PD below.\n1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:\nElectricity in Rajasthan is mainly generated from the fossil fuel dominated power plants (see\nsection 2.4 for details). In the absence of the project activity, equivalent amount of electricity\nwould have been generated by the operation of fossil fuel dominated power plants. The\nelectricity grid is power deficit and hence the new capacity has to be added in the grid system\nwhich would be fossil fuel dominated electricity generation.\nPP has installed the project activity at a location which is a barren land and there is no\nagriculture activity being undertaken at this site. There is neither any industrial activity\nundertaken nor any human displacement done at the site because of the project activity.\nThe purpose of the present project activity is to harness renewable resources in the region,\nand thereby displacing non- renewable natural resources and ultimately leading to sustainable\neconomic and environmental development. The project activity includes development,\ndesign, engineering, procurement, finance, construction, operation and maintenance of wind\nenergy based electric generating stations supplying electricity to the RVPNL grid.\n1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG\nemission reductions and\/or removal enhancements:\nThe project activity is a Greenfield wind power project activity with a totalled installed\ncapacity of 2.5 MW and is expected to generate 4899 MWh per annum. The electricity thus\ngenerated is sold to the Jaipur DISCOM. In the absence of the project activity, equivalent\namount of electricity would have been generated by the operation of existing\/proposed grid\nconnected fossil fuel dominated power plants. The Project activity will thus reduce the\n5","groundtruth":"{'project_name': 'Positive Climate Care 2.5 MW Grid connected Wind Power Project Activity by Ms. Aishwarya Rai in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, India', 'project_summary': 'The project activity is an initiative by Ms. Aishwarya Rai towards clean energy generation by means of installation of 2 state-of-art WEGs of individual capacity 1.25 MW each, at village Kotari near Soda Mada, District Jaisalmer in the State of Rajasthan aggregated to a total installed capacity of 2.5MW.

No-tillage can effectively reduce the\nloosening of the surface soil layer and soil disturbance, reduce the loss of water and nutrients in\nthe soil, ensure the retention of organic matter in the soil, reduce the degree of compaction of\nthe tillage equipment on the tillage soil layer, and preserve appropriate space for the growth of\ncrops, which is convenient for ventilation and keeps the soil with good water storage capacity.\nThe application of no-tillage sowing has solved the problem of sand blowing in bare farmland to\na certain extent and played a role in windbreak and sand fixation. No-tillage can maximize the\nprotective effect of straw mulching on soil.\nThe project plans to implement improved agricultural land management practices in 87,479 ha\ncorn field in the first crediting period to increase soil organic carbon (SOC). The project proponent\nnot only introduced more efficient and appropriate tillage method with Zhaoyuan Agriculture and\nRural Affairs Bureau (ZARAB) to the farmers, but also provide technical training and support to\nthe farmers.\nThe scenario existing prior to the project\u2019s implementation is primarily conventional tillage with\nstraw mulching, which increase soil disturbance and the loss of soil organic matter (SOM).\nDuring the first crediting period from 07-Apr-2021 to 06-Apr-2031, the project is expected to\ngenerate GHG emission removals of 1,315,100 tCO e, with an average annual GHG emission 2\nremoval of 131,510 tCO e. 2\n1.2 Audit History\n1.3 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\n4","question":"What is the project summary, province, country, latitude, and longitude of this project?","context":"\n\n[['Audit type', 'Period', 'Program', '', 'Validation\/verification', '', '', 'Number of'], [None, None, None, None, 'body name', None, None, 'years'], ['Validation', 'NA', 'VCS', 'To be determined', 'To be determined', None, '\/', '\/']]\n[['Sectoral scope', '', '14.

Without the implementation of this project,\nwhich provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded\nmethod would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded\nmethod is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition\ncan emit a large amount of methane (CH ) because of anaerobic decomposition, the 4\nintermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase\nand methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results\nin not only large amount of methane (CH ) emissions but also low rice productivity by 4\nreplacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens\nthe period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH emission 4\ncan be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an\nestimated amount of GHG emission reduction 4.32tCO e\/ha for single-cropping rice is 2\nexpected.

China. The project is designed to construct methane recovery and utilization system for each rural household of 13,104 in total. According to the construction plan, the construction is conducted in steps and phases. 3,429 household biogas digesters installation are carried out in 2008; 5,675 household biogas digesters are installed in 2009; the remaining 4,000 biogas digesters installation are constructed in 2010. The construction is strictly based on National Standard GB\/T4750-2002 for biogas digester and GB\/T 3606-2001 for biogas stove. The main objective of the Project is to dispose the raw manure from pigs by anaerobic digester with a volume of 8m 3 , and to collect biogas generated during the treatment process for thermal supply which meets the cooking and water heating demands of the rural household itself by biogas stove with a thermal flow of 3.26kW each one. Before implementing the Project, all the manure would be left to decay in the uncovered anaerobic mature management system, i.e. deep pit with depth of 1meter at least; the methane generated would be emitted to the atmosphere. In addition, the heat would in the absence of the project activity be generated by stove fired with fossil fuels 1 , which is stated in the investigation report on rural household biogas utilization by Heishan County on September, 2007. The scenario in the absence of the project activity is identical to the baseline scenario.', 'project_state_province': 'Liaoning', 'project_country': 'China', 'project_latitude': 41.6, 'project_longitude': 122.08}"}
