Identify the relevant electricity system.\nConsidering the stated by the \u201cTool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system\u201d, and the\nfact that the Brazilian DNA has published the Resolution no 8 issued on May 26th, 2008, which defines\nBrazilian Interconnected Grid as a single system that covers all five macro-geographical regions of the\n51\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\ncountry (North, Northeast, South, Southeast and Midwest), the Brazilian electricity system boundaries\nare clearly defined.\nSTEP 2. Choose whether to include off-grid power plants in the project electricity system (optional).\nSince the Brazilian DNA has made available the emission factor calculation based on information of the\ngrid power plants only, the off-grid power plants are not considered.\nSTEP 3. Select a method to determine the operating margin (OM).\nThe method adopted to calculate the operating margin is \u201cDispatch data analysis OM\u201d. The calculation\nis performed by the Brazilian DNA and made publicly available.\nThe Dispatch Data emission factor (OM), is summarized as follows:\n\uf0e5 EG \u22c5EF\nPJ,h EL,DD,h\nEF = h\ngrid,OM\u2212DD,y EG\nPJ,y\nWhere:\nEF = Dispatch data analysis operating margin CO emission factor in year y (tCO \/MWh); grid,OM-DD,y 2 2\nEG = Electricity displaced by the project activity in hour h of year y (MWh); PJ,h\nEF = CO emission factor for grid power units in the top of the dispatch order in hour h in EL,DD,h 2\nyear y (tCO \/MWh); 2\nEG = Total electricity displaced by the project activity in year y (MWh). PJ,y\nh = Hours in year y in which the project activity is displacing grid electricity (h)\ny = Year in which the project activity is displacing grid electricity\nSTEP 4. Calculate the operating margin emission factor according to the selected method.\nFor effect of ex-ante estimation to EF value, was calculated the arithmetic average of 12 grid,OM-DD,y\nmonths emission factors of the operating margin, published by the DNA (data available to year 2021).\nTable 4: Emission Factor of Operating Margin for year 2021\n52\n\n[['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December'], ['0.6001', '0.6023', '0.5657', '0.5522', '0.5909', '0.594', '0.5824', '0.6214', '0.6351', '0.6236', '0.6331', '0.5815']]\n[['BBBBUUUUIIIILLLLDDDD MMMMAAAARRRRGGGGIIIINNNN', None], ['', None], ['Average Emission Factor (tCO \/MWh) - AAAANNNNNNNNUUUUAAAALLLL\\n2', None], ['2021', ''], [None, '0.0540']]\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\nThus, the Emission Factor of Operating Margin is:\nEF = 0. 5985 grid,OM-DD,y\nSTEP 5. Calculate the build margin (BM) emission factor.\nThe power units included in the build margin are defined by the Brazilian DNA who is responsible for\nthe operating margin and build margin calculations. The results of these are made publicly available in\nits web site to consultation.\nAccording to the used methodology, the build margin emission factor (BM) is calculated as follows:\n\uf0e5 EG .EF\nm,y EL,m,y\nEF = i,m\ngrid,BM,y \uf0e5 EG\nm,y\nm\nFor the build margin emission factor EF also will be adopted the 2020 year value published by grid,BM,y\nthe DNA.\nTable 5: Latest data from Brazilian DNA to Emission Factor Build Margin (2021)\nSo, we have that the Build Margin Emission Factor is:\nEF = 0.0540 grid,BM,y\nSTEP 6. Calculate the combined margin (CM) emission factor.\nTo calculation of combined margin emission factor (combination of operation and build margins) is\nused a weighted-average formula, considering w = 0.25 and w = 0.75 (second credit period).

Thus, we used our theory of\nchange logic in the Result Chain diagrams (section Error! Reference source not found.) as the basis\nfor selecting indicators that factor in attribution. We then decided on the best sampling methods to use\nto collect these data to acceptable levels accuracy, precision and cost effectiveness whilst retaining\ntransparency and simplicity. From this, a Monitoring Plan was developed to guide data collection.\nFurther, the indicators will be analyzed based on the Pressure-State-Response framework, which also\nrelies on a causal-chain logic, where threats negatively impact the status\/condition of biodiversity, while\n87\n\nProject Description: SD VISta Version 1\nresponses or project interventions reduce pressure. Most Response indicators can be grouped under:\nHabitat improvement; Security enhancement; and Improvement of community livelihoods efforts.\nPressure indicators fall under: Human population size and dynamics; Human-wildlife conflict (HWC);\nand Incidences including poaching, grazing, encroachment, charcoal and firewood collection amongst\nothers. Finally, State indicators are grouped into three categories: wildlife (including species presence,\ndiversity, distribution and movement); vegetation and land-use (including changes in various\nvegetation\/habitat types, encroachment and fire). Most of the response and pressure indicators\ncorrespond to the social indicators developed in the community monitoring plan (See Section. 4.3.1),\nand so data collection follows the protocols outlined therein. On top, we determined 12 indicators not\npart of the social indicator set, also classified into three categories: Output 4; Outcome 4; and Impact.\nFor these new indicators, two main strategies will be used to obtain the data: In-house reporting and\nGovernment records, mostly for output and outcome indicators, and surveys for most impact indicators.\nWe envision three main aspects of state indicators to measure, each with a distinct set of monitoring\nprotocols:\nWildlife: wildlife surveys and monitoring for all species \u2013 with a focus on HCVs \u2013 will be done using\nseveral methods: ranger patrols, camera traps, fecal-DNA analysis, and information from any\nindependent research projects in the area\nVegetation and Land-use: carbon plot monitoring plots and remote sensing (based on LANDSAT\nimagery) and GIS techniques.\n88\n\n[['Focal Issue', 'Key results', 'SMART\\nObjective', None, None, 'Indicato\\nr Code', 'Indicator', None, None, 'Indicator\\ntype', '', 'Data', '', 'Who?', 'When?', 'Where\\n?'], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'collection', None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'method', None, None, None, None], ['Forest\\ndestruction\\nand land\\nencroachmen\\nt', 'Decrease in\\nillegal logging', '', 'By 2027,', '', '', 'Seven\\nindicators\\nincluded in\\nthe SIA\\nMonitoring\\nPlan', None, None, '', '', None, None, '', '', ''], [None, None, None, 'reduce the', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'number of', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'illegal', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'logging', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'incidents by', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'half in the', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'SCRP', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['', 'Decrease in\\nencroachmen\\nt and land-\\ngrabbing', '', 'By 2022,', '', '', 'Eight related\\nindicators\\nincluded in\\nthe SIA\\nMonitoring\\nPlan', None, None, '', '', None, None, '', '', ''], [None, None, None, 'two CPA', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'are created,', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'registered at', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'MoE and', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'their NTFPs', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'can access', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, 'markets', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['', '', '', None, None, 'BIA003', '', '# and types', '', 'Impact', 'CPA\\nrecords', None, None, 'Communit\\ny outreach', 'Annuall\\ny', 'Project\\nZone'], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'of NTFPs', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'sold in', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'markets', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['', '', '', None, None, 'BIA004', '', 'Amount of', '', 'Impact', 'CPA\\nrecords', None, None, 'Communit\\ny outreach', 'Annuall\\ny', 'Project\\nZone'], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'revenue', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'accruing', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'from NTFP', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'sales from', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'the area', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]]\n[['SMART'], ['Objective']]\n[['Seven'], ['indicators'], ['included in'], ['the SIA'], ['Monitoring'], ['Plan']]\n[['Forest'], ['destruction'], ['and land'], ['encroachmen'], ['t']]\n[['Decrease in'], ['illegal logging']]\n[['Eight related'], ['indicators'], ['included in'], ['the SIA'], ['Monitoring'], ['Plan']]\n[['Decrease in'], ['encroachmen'], ['t and land-'], ['grabbing']]\n[['CPA'], ['records']]\n[['CPA'], ['records']]\nProject Description: SD VISta Version 1\nBiodiversity Impact Assessment: Monitoring Plan\nTable 9: Project biodiversity impact assessment for monitoring plan.\n89"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No relevant information found in context"}]}

No\ndislocation of people or wildlife will occur as a result of the project activity.\nThere are no federal authorizations or permits required for the project that would\nentail consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, to include the\nneed to obtain project authorization from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. There\nare four federally listed endangered or threatened species that potentially occur in\nthe general vicinity of the Red Hills Wind Project: the interior least tern, whooping\ncrane, piping plover, and the Arkansas River shiner. The project activity has been\ndesigned to avoid impacts on the United States waterways.\nAcciona Wind Energy USA LLC voluntarily contracted HDR Engineering, Inc.\n(HDR) and Western Ecosystems Technology Inc. to complete the environmental\nsite assessment (ESA) and Biological Assessment of the property proposed for the\nRed Hills Wind Project. The environmental assessment was completed by HDR on\nJanuary 30, 2008 and the biological assessment was completed by Western\nEcosystems on March 27, 2008.\nWestern Ecosystems determined that; \u201cThe Red Hills project avoids many of the\npotential impacts to whooping cranes due to its distal proximity to the main\nmigratory flyway.\u201d Western Ecosystems also determined that other aforementioned\nendangered species were not threatened by the project activity.\nAcciona voluntarily contracted Western Ecosystems to conduct a voluntary bat\nassessment using acoustic monitoring equipment. Additionally post construction\nbat mortality monitoring will take place for one year after operation of the facility\nbegins. Any bats that are found during these mortality studies will be offered as a\ndonation to the American Museum of Natural History for their ongoing Genomic\nStudies.\nFurther studies such as the wetlands delineation was conducted on November 26\nand 27, 2007, by two HDR biologists. The survey was conducted in accordance\nwith the Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual (Environmental\nLaboratory, 1987).\nAcciona proposes to implement the following design, siting, and conservation\nmeasures to ensure to that the ecological environment is not affected by the project\nactivity:\n\u2022 Turbine Design: Acciona will use monopole, tubular designs that\neliminate avian perching sites. Guy wires will not be used on\nturbines. If guy wires are used on the permanent and temporary\nmeteorological towers within the project, appropriate high visibility\nmarkings will be used.\n\u2022 Collector Line Design: Acciona will bury the majority (about 88%) of\nthe collector lines for the project. For the overhead collector line\n41\n\nProprietary and Confidential\nsegments and the overhead 138 kV transmission line, Acciona will\nmark the lines in accordance with methods recommended by the\nAvian Power Line Committee (APLIC).\n\u2022 Transmission Line: Using guidance from APLIC\u2019s Suggested\nPractices for Avian Protection on Power Lines, approximately 4 miles\nof on-site overhead 138 kV transmission line will be designed to\nminimize the potential for bird electrocutions.\n\u2022 Lighting: The Red Hills Wind Project will use the minimum amount\nof lighting as required by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\nLighting is anticipated to be pulsating red light on the minimum\nnumber of turbines as required by the FAA in order to reduce the\ndisturbances on the local population.\n\u2022 Air Impacts: Wind Power plants do not contribute to atmospheric\npollution as no fuel combustion is involved during any stage of the\noperation. The primary emissions source for the project will be motor\nvehicle exhaust resulting from construction and maintenance of the\nproject. However, in light of the project activity and the resulting\nemission reductions, motor vehicle emissions will be a very minor\nemissions source.\n\u2022 Noise Impacts: Personal protective equipment is provided to workers\ninvolved in construction activity to mitigate the effects of noise\npollution. Taking into consideration the project life cycle, the\nmagnitude of the impacts during the construction phase are negligible\nand exists for a temporary period of time until the end of construction\nphase. Therefore, noise pollution will also be a very minor issue and\nwill not harm the environment.\nAcciona recognizes the concerns over the relationship between wind energy\ndevelopment and the ecological environment of the project activity. As such,\ncommitments have been made to evaluate and immediately address issues that\nimpact the project activity area.\n42\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n6 Stakeholders\u2019 comments:\nStakeholders for the Red Hills Wind Farm project include landowners, local\nresidents, local officials, and Acciona staff.\nRoger Mills County held public meetings on February 11th and June 16th 2008 to\ndiscuss permitting issues for the Red Hills Wind Farm. During these meetings,\nlocal constituents were provided the opportunity and platform to discuss their\nconcerns about the project activity.\nEach meeting began with a brief progress update for the project activity by the\nproject developer, construction manager, and other project officials. The overall\nreaction can be summarized as positive. The local residents expressed satisfaction\nthat the project activity has created local employment which is improving the\nstandard of life as well as socio-economic conditions of the surrounding area.\nMoreover, local landowners have expressed satisfaction that the project activity has\nled to an increase in land values.\nOnly one negative issue was raised by one non-participating landowner at the\nFebruary 11th meeting. This landowner raised concerns that the turbines were too\nclose to the fence surrounding his property, which is not in the project activity\narea. This concern was investigated by the project developer and it was discovered\nthat the landowner had mistaken a property survey stake that was about 30 feet\nfrom his fence for a turbine-staked location. This issue was resolved through\nfurther communication with the landowner and was publicly addressed at the June\n16th community meeting.\nIn July 2008, two non-participating landowners from Roger Mills County requested\nto meet with the project developer to express concerns that the project activity was\nlocated too close to their property lines. The landowners expressed that they felt\nthat permitting had occurred without their knowledge and felt that they had been\ncircumvented in the process. Over the course of a two-hour meeting, it was pointed\nout that Acciona had followed the counties permitting guidance and that there were\ntwo public meetings that they did not attend.\nThese landowners as well as all stakeholders involved in this project activity will be\nnotified of all future public meetings.\n43\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n7 Schedule:\nThe Red Hills crediting period will begin on the commercial operation date of\nOctober 26, 2008 and will last for 10 years thereafter. The lifespan of the wind\nfarm is expected to be 20 years after the operational date. The project activity will\nnot be terminated for any reason, other than for emergencies, until the end of the\noperational life. Validation will be complete upon review and approval of this\ndocument. Verification will occur depending on the needs of project participants.\n44\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n8 Ownership:"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2018: 293839.0, 2017: 293839.0, 2016: 293839.0, 2015: 293839.0, 2014: 293839.0, 2013: 293839.0, 2012: 293839.0, 2011: 293839.0, 2010: 293839.0, 2009: 587678.0, 2008: 293839.0}"}]}
