"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology of this project involves several steps and considerations:

1. Additionality Methods: The project follows the guidelines outlined in section 3.5 additionality.

2. Methodology Deviations:
   a. Grid emission factor: The project owner is unable to calculate the grid emission factor as the data is not available in the public domain. Therefore, the project owner requests to use the publicly available grid emission factor for the project. For the first crediting period, the project owner selects the latest and conservative grid emission factor value provided by IRENA.
   b. Benchmarking Boundary: The benchmark boundary is defined as the city where the project activity is located, which in this case is Abu Dhabi. The project is limited to the Abu Dhabi Emirate, United Arab Emirates.

3. Quantification of Estimated GHG Emission Reductions and Removals:
   a. Baseline Emissions: The baseline emissions are estimated using Approach 1 as the benchmark installation is electricity-driven technology. The total baseline emissions are calculated using Equation (2) from the methodological tool 05. Parameters such as estimated electricity consumption, average technical transmission and distribution losses, and the grid CO2 emission factor are considered in the calculation.

Please note that the provided information is a summary of the methodology described in the project documentation. For more detailed information, it is recommended to refer to the specific project documentation.","

Additionality Methods
All the steps are explained in the section 3.5 additionality.
3.6 Methodology Deviations
1. Grid emission factor
The methodology refers to CDM Tool 7 for electricity grid emission factor. However, the data is
not available in public domain to calculate the grid emission factor and therefore project owner
is not able to calculate this factor.
The project owner request to use the publicly available grid emission factor for the project,
which will be fix for first crediting period. For future crediting period project owner anticipates
that the data will be available to calculate the grid emission factor and then the Tool 7 or any
other Verra guidance will be used for the project.
Based on publicly available information, the following data is available for UAE grid emission
factor:
The Project will consumed less electricity with respect to the baseline and therefore lower grid
emission factor will result in lower baseline emissions and lower emission reductions and
therefore the lower grid emission factor will be conservative of therefor lower value (IRENA) is
selected. As IRENA value is latest and conservative therefore this has been used for the first
crediting period.

As per the Methodology the default benchmark boundary is a city where the project activity is
located which is Abu Dhabi.
No definition is provided related with the city.
The UAE is divided into seven administrative divisions (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm
Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah), referred as emirates. Each emirates have its own
rules and regulations and clear demarcation of boundary.
 Therefore, Abu Dhabi Emirate is considered as city for methodological requirement and
benchmark boundary. As this is grouped project and therefore the boundary is limited
to Abu Dhabi Emirate, United Arab Emirates.

 109 Increased interest in wind energy proj ects of other clients will further push 
R&D efforts by technology providers to develop more efficient and better 
machinery in future. 
 
• Economic: 
9 The project activity requires tempor ary and permanent, skilled and semi-
skilled manpower at the wind park; this will create additional employment 
opportunities.  
9 The generated electricity will be fed to the regional grid through local grid, 
thereby improving the grid frequency and availability of electricity to the 
local consumers (villagers  & sub-urban habitants) which will provide new 
opportunities for industries and economic activities to be setup in the area 
thereby resulting in greater local empl oyment, ultimately leading to overall 
development.  
 
• Sectoral Scope: 1, “ Grid connected renewable electricity generation “  
• Social:  
9 The project activity has led to the de velopment of supporting infrastructure 
such as road network etc., in the wind park location, which also provides 
access to the local population. 
9 The project activity leads to alleviation of poverty by establishing direct and 
indirect benefits through employment generation and improved economic 
activities by strengthening of local gr id of the state electricity utility. 
9 Use of a renewable source of energy reduces the dependence on imported 
fossil fuels and associated price variation thereby leading increased energy 
security. 
 
• Environmental:  
 
9 The project activity involves use of renewable energy source for electricity 
generation instead of fossil fuel based electricity generation which would 
have emitted gaseous, liquid and/or solid effluents/wastes. 
9 Being a renewable resource, using wind energy to generate electricity 
contributes to resource conservation. Thus the project causes no negative 
impact on the surrounding environmen t contributing to environmental well-
being.

resources. Malawi’s forest areas have continuously decreased over recent decades2, and its growing
population coupled with the effects of a changing climate further exacerbates the country’s historical
trend of deforestation and forest degradation. Forest loss in Malawi is a leading cause of soil degradation
and erosion, with cascading negative effects on water and soil nutrient availability that further challenges
smallholder agriculture in the country3, putting much of the population’s overall resilience at risk.
In an effort to reverse this trend, Ripple Africa and GreenCollar are implementing a grouped afforestation
project in the Northern and Central regions of Malawi. The first activity instance of this grouped project
takes place in the District of Mzimba, with the planting of 1.8 million trees in 2022 and 2023. Subsequent
planting across the districts will be added to the grouped project as new activity instances.
Over 66% of Malawi’s forest area is located in the Northern and Central regions of the country. Malawi is
severely affected by deforestation with a high average annual rate of 1.5% between 2018-2022 and a
16% decrease in tree cover in 2001-20234. Deforestation is driven by the unsustainable and often illegal
collection of wood fuel and encroachment of farmland. The afforestation project will alleviate pressure
on existing forests in the Northern and Central regions of the country and integrate forest regeneration
into local community practices by planting trees on degraded land, fostering forest conservation, building
landholder capacity to manage and maintain planted forests and tree nurseries, and providing alternative
sources of income to the people participating in the program (hereafter, Registered Beneficiaries).
Furthermore, Ripple Africa will use a portion of the funding generated by the project through the sale of
carbon credits for additional activities that will benefit communities. This may include planting community
fruit trees in farms and schools and establishing Forest Conservation Committees to strengthen native
forest protection and regeneration in the region. Fruit tree planting and forest conservation activities will
enhance the positive climate, environmental and socioeconomic impact of the afforestation project but
will not generate additional VCUs for the project.
To implement the project, Ripple Africa has the approval of the Department of Forestry which will support
Ripple Africa’s engagement with local leaders and communities. To ensure the long-term success of the
project activities and the sustained growth of the planted trees, Ripple Africa will sign Tree Planting
Program Landholder Agreements with Registered Beneficiaries participating in the project’s afforestation
activities. Ripple Africa has been implementing environmental, educational, and healthcare programs in
Malawi for the last 20 years, maintaining a strong local presence, and has prior experience planting trees
in the country.

JOINT PROJECT DESCRIPTION & MONITORING REPORT: VCS Version 3
1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project and its Implementation Status
The project activity consists of 20 MW biomass-based power Plant at Nimdha (V), Dhenkanal
District, Orissa State. The project activity has been essentially conceived to generate GHG
emission free electricity by making use of available biomass at the project site to supply the
electricity to the grid. The project being a renewable energy project leads to sustainable
development through efficient utilization of available natural resources and generation of
additional employment for the local stakeholders.
The project activity is generation of electricity by utilizing surplus biomass residues like paddy
stalks, ground nut shell, stalks of red grams, mung, til, maize etc. agro industrial waste (rice
husk) and woody biomass (juliflora & casuarina twigs, etc) from agricultural/waste lands,
which are available in the project region and exporting the generated electricity to the grid
system owned by Orissa Power Transmission Corporation Limited (OPTCL), a state utility
which is part of grid.
As the project activities utilize naturally available Biomass project for power generation and do
not use any fossil fuels, the project contributes for reduction of greenhouse gases, which
would have, otherwise, been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants
and/or by addition of new generation sources.
Objective of the Project
The installations of the project activities have been carried out with a motive of generation of
electricity from environmentally benign source of energy. The project activity comprises of
biomass plant. The details of the investor along with the unique identification of the Plant have
been provided in Section A.4.2.
Nature of the Project
The basic technology involved in the project is is generating electricity using biomass
(agricultural residues) with a 90 TPH biomass fired boiler (BFBC) using a 23 MW turbine
whose capacity will be governed at 20MW. On an annual average basis, the project exports
around 124.57 GWh to the OPTCL grid, which is belongs to eastern grid, which is a part of the
NEWNE grid1. Considering auxiliary power consumption of 10 % the plant is expected to
operate at an annual average plant load factor of 80%.

JOINT PROJECT DESCRIPTION & MONITORING REPORT: VCS Version 3
The PP of SGEL has entered into a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with state
utility for a period of 20 years from the date of implementation of project.
Scenario existing prior to the implementation of project activity:
The scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project activity, is electricity delivered
to the grid by the project activity that would have otherwise been generated by the operation of
grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as reflected in the
combined margin (CM) calculations described in the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for
an electricity system”.
Baseline Scenario:
As per the applicable methodology, a Greenfield power plant is defined as “a new renewable
energy power plant that is constructed and operated at a site where no renewable energy
power plant was operated prior to the implementation of the project activity”.
As the project activity falls under the definition of a Greenfield power plant, the baseline
scenario as per paragraph 24 of Section 5.2.1 of applied methodology is the following:
If the project activity is the installation of a Greenfield power plant, the baseline scenario is
electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by
the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources,
as reflected in the combined margin (CM) calculations described in the “Tool to calculate the
emission factor for an electricity system”.
Hence, pre-project scenario and baseline scenario are the same.
Contribution to GHG emissions reduction
The project activity harnesses wind energy to generate and supply electricity to the Indian
grid. The Project displaces fossil fuel-based electricity generation that would have otherwise
been provided by the operation and expansion of the fossil fuel-based power plants in regional
electricity grid, thereby leading to reduction in emission of greenhouse gases associated with
fossil fuel-based electricity generation.
As a result, GHG emission reductions by project is estimated to be approximately 104,744
tCO2e per year and total GHG emission reductions of 626,971 tCO2e for the crediting period,
thereon displacing 746,395 MWh/year amount of electricity from the gird.
The project is already registered with UNFCCC CDM (UN ref. no. 59052) on 18 Jul 2012 with
fixed crediting period 18 Jul 12 - 17 Jul 22.

PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The Suşehri HPP facilities are developed and owned by YPM Elektrik Üretim A.Ş. in the districts
of Suşehri of Sivas province, Central Anatolia and has achieved all the necessary licenses to
implement the project. The purpose of the project activity is to generate electricity from renewable
sources and to sell it to the National Grid.
The electricity generation license consists of five HPPs; Gölova, Sevindik, Konak, Beypınarı and
Altıntepe with total installed capacities of 19 MW.
First Konak HPP, Beypınarı HPP and Altıntepe HPP was constructed and are under operation
since 2007. The other two, Gölova and Sevindik HPPs which were built and are operational since
2009 with installed capacities 1.05 MWm and 5.714 MWm respectively are the only project
activity of this PDD according to the Turbine Purchase Agreement1. The license2 is issued by
EMRA with installed capacities 1.05MWm for Gölova HPP and 6.30 MWm for Sevindik HPP. The
difference is due to the license application which was for 1.05 MWm for Gölova and 6.30 MWm
for Sevindik and the license was issued accordingly after the Turbine Purchase Agreement with
Kossler, Kossler team has conducted a research on the site for the appropriate installed capacity
and decided their only suitable equipment for the flow rate are 1.05MWm for Gölova and
5.714MWm Sevindik. Also, the FSR statement is prepared with 1.00 MWe and 5.28 MWe of
installed capacities for Gölova and Sevindik respectively. Therefore, the EIA Exemption Letter3 is
prepared indicating as the FSR states. Since the licensing procedure went on with 1.05 MWm
and 6.30 MWm for Gölova and Sevindik respectively and there are not any appeals from the
Ministry of Energy and Natural resources, there is not any situation that opposes the regulations.
The total installed capacity of the Project Activity is 6.764 MWm where Gölova HPP is 1.05 MWm
while Sevindik HPP is 5.714 MWm with gross electricity productions of 4.78GWh and 32.47GWh
respectively. The total gross electricity production of the project activity is 37.25 GWh per year4.
As calculated in the Feasibility Study Report, the line losses and the internal consumption of the
generated electricity is 0.64% and results in 37.01 GWh net electricity supply to the National
Grid5. The total 37.01 GWh of the net electricity generation of the project activity is divided as
4.75 GWh net electricity generation for Gölova HPP and 32.26 GWh net electricity generation for
Sevindik HPP.
The Project Activity is located on the irrigation canals of Gölova Dam and could only start
operation after the rehabilitation of the irrigation canals and the reparation of the cracks on the
canal walls which decrease water flow due to water losses. Although the Project Activity and the
Gölova Dam are under different managements, the Project Activity uses the Gölova Dam as
reservoir.
The Project Activity will not produce any Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions during the operation.
The electricity generated by the Project Activity can displace part of the power from the fossil fuel

A.4.3. Technology to be employed by the project activity:
>>
The purpose of the Project is to use well established wind power generation technology for electricity
generation and transmission to generate low emissions electricity for the Grid thereby displacing CO 2
emissions from electricity generation from the Grid. The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario
existing prior to the start of the implementation of the project activity: electricity delivered to the Grid by
the project would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by
the addition of new generation sources. The Grid includes the Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong
and Inner Mongolia Provincial Power Grids.
The proposed project involves the installation of 66 wind turbines each of which with a rated capacity of
750kW, providing a total capacity of 49.5MW. The expected annual electricity supply to the grid is
119,226MWh. The height of the rotor hub of all turbines is 60m. As the wind resource in the area is
plentiful, and the average wind speed is relatively high, averaging7.9m/s at a height of 55m and 8.1m/s at
a height of 65m, the wind resources are sufficient to run a wind farm at the location.
The construction includes a 220kV step-up substation. The wind power to be generated will be delivered
to the 220kV step-up substation by 35kV transmission lines. The electricity will be delivered from the
220kV step-up substation to the existing Huitengliang 220kV transformer substation. From the 220 kV
substation the electricity generated will be transmitted to the Inner Mongolia Power Grid.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittently flooded conditions during rice
cultivation is conducted in the north of Qujing City, Yunnan Province, China, with a total acreage
of 12,106 ha of double-cropping rice. Without the project, there would be no ditches, pumps,
valves, and reservoirs to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously
flooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was cultivated by the
continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under
flooded conditions can emit a large amount of methane because of anaerobic decomposition,
the intermittently flooded method is more conducive to saving water, increasing rice yield, and
reducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.
The implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir
construction, pumps and valves installation, training, etc. According to the needs of rice growth,
farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water
resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic
conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice
paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in
the rainy season. In this case, the methane emission can be declined by an average of 48%.
Hence, with the proposed project activity, the estimated GHG reduction from rice is 4.93
tCO e/ha. 2
The project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions by 418,012 tCO e in the first seven-year 2
period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 59,716 tCO e. The project aims to 2
reduce GHG and mitigate climate changes, increase rice productivity resulting in higher living
standards for local farmers and provide more job opportunities.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
This project is categorized as sectoral scope 14 (AFOLU) under Verra as justified in Section 1.3,
although the AMS-III.AU methodology applied is approved under sectoral scope 15 (Agriculture)
of CDM.
The project is developed under VCS scope 14 “Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)”
with an activity category of Improved Cropland Management (ICM) under Agricultural Land
Management (ALM).

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittently flooded conditions during rice
cultivation is conducted in Bijie City, Guizhou Province, China, with a total acreage of 19,213 ha
for single-cropping rice. Without the project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently
flooded method, the traditional continuously flooded method would be continued, so the
scenario that rice was cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario.
Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded conditions can emit a large amount of
methane because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittently flooded method is more
beneficial to water conservation, production increase, and less methane emission reduction than
the continuously flooded.
The implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir
construction, pumps and valves installation, training, etc. According to the needs of rice growth,
farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water
resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic
conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice
paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in
the rainy season. In this case, the methane emission can be declined by an average of 48%.
Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction of
3.09 tCO e/ha for rice. 2
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to
416,115 tCO e in the first seven-year period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 2
59,445 tCO e. The project aims to Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes, 2
increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standards of local farmers and provide
more job opportunities.

VCS Project Description
• The project activity contributes to economic sustainability around the plant site and encourages
economic power decentralization.
Environmental well-being:
• The project utilizes hydropower to generate electricity, which otherwise would have been
generated through fuel- (most likely fossil-fuel-) based power plants. This way it is
contributing to a reduction in specific emissions (emissions of pollutant/unit of energy
generated), including GHG emissions.
• As hydroelectric power projects produce no end-products in the form of solid waste (ash, etc.),
they don’t have to cope with the problem of solid waste disposal encountered by most other
sources of power.
• Being a renewable energy source, hydro energy is used to generate electricity that contributes
to resource conservation.
• Thus, the project causes no negative impact on the surrounding environment; and in the end
contributes to environmental well being due to the run-off river type of project activity.
Technological well being:
• The project supports high quality equipment transfer from other regions and even other
countries, and contributes to capacity building of the labor force through training and practical
work.
• The project promotes local products developed in the region, when replacement of spare parts
is necessary, and supports renewable technology development especially for hydroelectric
power technology.
In view of the above explanation, the project participants consider the project activity as
profoundly contributing to sustainable development.

"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology of the Nascente Ceramic VCS project is based on Category AMS-I.E: Switch from Non-Renewable Biomass for Thermal Applications by the User – Version 01 from February 01 of 2008 onwards. This methodology is applicable for project activities that aim to avoid greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable biomass to generate thermal energy.

The project justifies the choice of this methodology by explaining that the use of non-renewable biomass, such as firewood, is not considered a renewable source of biomass. The project aims to displace the use of non-renewable biomass by introducing new renewable energy technologies.

The project utilizes renewable biomass sources such as sawdust, wood chips, peanut shells, and sugar cane bagasse, which are all residues generated by reforestation or agroindustrial projects. Additionally, elephant grass is considered renewable as long as it meets certain criteria related to land use and management practices.

In the baseline scenario, the project identifies the use of non-renewable biomass in ceramic kilns as a source of greenhouse gas emissions. By switching to renewable biomass sources, the project aims to reduce these emissions.","

2.1 Title and reference of the VCS methodology applied
to the project activity and explanation of methodology
choices:
! Category AMS-I.E: Switch from Non–Renewable Biomass for Thermal
Applications by the User – Version 01 from February 01 of 2008 onwards.
The amount of non-renewable biomass (B ) will be determined according to the y
option “b” of the applied methodology once option “a” is designed for really
small appliances like household stoves and does not fit for the kind of
projects in question.
The project’s emissions from the combustion of native wood are accounted in
the same way as fossil fuel combustion, once it is not renewable and emits
CO . 2
2.2 Justification of the choice of the methodology and
why it is applicable to the project activity:
The methodology applied is Category AMS-I.E: Switch from Non–Renewable
Biomass for Thermal Applications by the User – Version 01 from February 01 of
2008 onwards which is applicable for project activities that avoid greenhouse
gas emissions by using renewable biomass in order to generate thermal energy.
This category comprises small thermal appliances that displace the use of
non-renewable biomass by introducing new renewable energy end-user
technologies. The end-user technology in the case of this project can be
established as the project proponent, who utilizes the thermal energy
generated by the new renewable energy technology.
There are no similar registered small-scale CDM project activities in the
region of Presidente Prudente once Social Carbon Company made a research and
did not find any registered small–scale CDM Project activity in the region.
The sources of registered small-scale CDM project activity consulted were the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 14 and
Brazilian’s Technology and Science Ministry15. Therefore, the proposed project
activity is not saving the non-renewable biomass accounted by the other
registered project activities.
The utilization of firewood from area without any kind of management can not
be considered a renewable source of biomass, since it involves a decrease of
carbon pools and increases the carbon emissions to the atmosphere, turning
green house effect even worse. Moreover, the native wood provided from areas
without a reforestation management plan does not fit any of the options of
UNFCCC definition of renewable biomass in Annex 18, EB 23.
Furthermore, firewood has been used for many decades as fuel in Brazil16.
Although, it is impossible to define a start date on which this kind of non-
renewable biomass began to be applied, there are many documents to prove that
wood has been used for thermal energy generation before 1989 as requested in
the applied methodology. Firewood used to be the most employed source of
primary energy until de decade of 1970, when the petroleum started to supply

Nascente Ceramic VCS Project Description
the majority of Brazilian’s energy needs17. Moreover the Brazilian’s Energy
and Mine Ministry has been monitoring every energetic sectors of Brazil since
1970, and firewood appears over the years monitored as a significant source
of thermal energy for ceramic sector18. Especially in the ceramic sector, the
use of firewood is visible non-renewable and unsustainable, involving
negative environmental impacts associated19.
This way, it can be concluded that non-renewable biomass has been used since
31 December 1989.
The biomasses utilized in the project, sawdust and sugar cane bagasse, are
common residue in the region generated.
Sawdust, wood chips, peanut shells and sugar cane bagasse are all industries
residues coming from large scale reforestation or agroindustrial projects, so
it is considered renewable according to option V of methodology definition of
renewable biomass: “The biomass is the non-fossil fraction of an industrial
or municipal waste”.
The elephant grass is considered renewable according to option III, as soon
as it fits all the assumptions below:
“The biomass is non-woody biomass and originates from croplands and/or
grasslands where:
(a) The land area remains cropland and/or grasslands or is reverted to
forest; and
(b) Sustainable management practices are undertaken on these land areas to
ensure in particular that the level of carbon stocks on these land areas does
not systematically decrease over time (carbon stocks may temporarily decrease
due to harvesting); and
(c) Any national or regional forestry, agriculture and nature conservation
regulations are complied with.”
Moreover, the project activity will annually generate less than 45 MWThermal.
2.3 Identifying GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs for
the baseline scenario and for the project:
According to the applied methodology, the project boundaries for the project
are the physical, geographical areas of the use of biomass or the renewable
energy, thus, the ceramic limits.
In the baseline scenario, there is use of non-renewable biomass to burn
ceramic devices in the ceramic’s kilns. This practice is responsible to
discharge in the atmosphere the carbon that was stored inside of the wood
(well-known by a carbon sink).

"What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?","Based on the information provided, the project sector being discussed is Renewable Energy, specifically the use of biomass as a non-conventional renewable energy source in Chile. The project aims to utilize waste from the lumber industry, mainly wood, to generate heat and electricity for the fishery manufacturing and processing industry.","PROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-PDD) - Version 03

Step 4. Common practice analysis 
 
Sub-step 4a. Analyze other activities similar to the proposed project activity: 
 
The biomass produced by the forestry industry is on e of the non-conventional renewable energy sources 
used in Chile (a share of 14 % of the national ener gy pool), and is mainly represented by wood, whose 
consumption is up to 12 millions of m3, which is most provided by natural forests.  However, with an 
increasing trend, the waste from the lumber indus try based on plantations is being progressively 
incorporated like a source to supply energy needs of this same industry2. 
 Nevertheless, despite the increasing utilization in the lumber industry, making use of waste of the forestry activities as a fuel to generate heat or electri city is not a common practice amongst the fishery 
manufacturing and processing.  This fact is supported because the most of fishery industries operating in 
Chile are using fossil fuel technologies in order to cover their needs of steam, heat and electricity.  The following table shows some examples of the fishery or food companies and some features of their boilers 
to meet energy requirements.  These facilities are mainly located within Region X and IX:

Gelimar Wood not available In operation 
* This table was prepared based on a personal communication of  Mr. Darío Vicencio, Expert in certification of boilers, Independent 
Consultant. 
 Besides these companies, there are others those have developed energy projects based on biomass during last years.  These projects, however, have incorpor ated the CDM component to their development; these 
initiatives are:  (i) Russfin Biomass CHP Plant Project , (ii) Trupan Biomass Power Plant in Chile, (iii) 
Nueva Aldea Biomass Power Plant Phase 1 and Phase II.  Nevertheless, these are slightly different from 
Panitao Biomass Thermal Energy Project, because in this  case the biomass will be used only to generate 
steam (heat), meanwhile the CDM projects are cogenera ting heat and electricity based in by-products of 
the lumber industry.

This methodology is applicable to grid-connected renewable power generation projects that involve the installation of a Greenfield power plant, capacity addition to existing plants, retrofit of existing plant(s)/unit(s), rehabilitation of existing plant(s)/unit(s), or replacement of existing plant(s)/unit(s).

For the specific case of this project, which involves the installation of a run-of-river power plant without a reservoir, the methodology considers the conditions outlined in the methodology document. These conditions include the absence of capacity additions, retrofits, rehabilitations, or replacements, and the power density calculated based on equation 3 of the methodology being greater than 4 W/m2. The project also falls under the category of an integrated hydropower project involving multiple power plants without a reservoir, where the water flow from upstream to downstream remains consistent throughout the project.

The project boundary, as defined by the methodology, includes the water diversion system, the new turbine generator systems, and equipment required to export the electricity to the grid (transformers, substations, etc).","

2.2 Applicability of Methodology
The consolidated methodology ACM0002 version 18.1 is applicable to grid-connected renewable
power generation projects that:
a. Install a Greenfield power plant;
b. Involve a capacity addition to existing plants;
c. Involve a retrofit of (an) existing plant(s)/unit(s); or
d. Involve a rehabilitation of (an) existing plant(s)/unit(s);
e. Involve a replacement of (an) existing plant(s)/unit(s).
As the project corresponds to the installation of a new power plant at a site where a renewable
power plant has not been operated (Greenfield power plant), the project fulfils condition a);
therefore, consolidated methodology ACM0002 is the most appropriate methodology for the
project. In addition, the methodology is applicable under the following conditions:

The Hornitos Hydroelectric Project is located near Los Andes city. This is approximately 100 km
northeast from Santiago (capital of the country). The hydro power plant will be located in a small valley
surrounded by mountains (Aconcagua Valley). The Hornitos Hydroelectric Project power plant is in
cascade with three other existing downstream hydropower plants (Aconcagua of 72 MW, Los Quilos of
39 MW and Chacabuquito 26 MW).
The international road Ch-60 from Los Andes to Mendoza is the main access road to the project.
Secondary and rural roads connect settlements and camps along that highway. There is little population in
the project area, which is mostly a mountain area.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
Aurum Sustainable Forest Inc (Aurum) is developing a forest carbon credit project to generate
greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and removals by extending the rotation age of their
operational forests. In addition to increasing the age of their forestlands, the Goldbeck Forest Carbon
Project (Goldbeck) will be reverting stand compositions back to natural longleaf pine forests where
appropriate. The carbon credit project will be implemented following the Verified Carbon Standard
(VCS) VM0003 – Methodology for Improved Forest Management Through Extension of Rotation Age
(IFM ERA).
Project instances will be implemented in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia; of the United States. The current project instance is
approximately 4,140 ha and is composed of non-contiguous parcels. The project has been designed as
a grouped project to allow for additional project activity instances to be added in the future. Additional
project activity instances implemented will be within a similar geographic area, allowing for the use of
the initial project baseline scenario for additionality purposes.
All activity instances included in the project are currently managed for timber harvest, and all forests
within the project activity instances are Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) certified, meeting the
VM0003 methodology requirement. Implementation of the project activity will result in the removal of
an estimated annual average of 309,030 tCO2e and total of 9,270,890 tCO2e over the 30-year project
period.
The project is currently under development. Monitoring results may impact the greenhouse gas
emissions reductions results that are currently presented in this version.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
Sectoral Scope 14
Improved Forest Management (IFM)
Extended Rotation Age (IFM ERA)

Site preparation will be carried out in accordance with the technical guidelines and procedures given
by the Ministry of Agriculture Development17.
As no, or very low pre-existing vegetation is present within project boundary (GIOES & APOR, 2006),
site preparation will only consist in punctual soil preparation before tree plantation. Soil preparation
consists in building anti-erosion constructions with the aim to limit wind erosion and retain water down
trees. These constructions are called “half-moon” in accordance with their geometric form (see Figure
10 below).
Figure 10. “half-moon” anti-erosion work (Photo: T.Dufour)
Depending on tree planting density, the area of soil disturbed by half-moon construction was estimated
between 2% and 3.5% of the project area.

1.13 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
Intermittent flooded water regime requires that irrigation and drainage can be controlled
according to the growth needs of rice during its cultivation. However, prior to the project initiation,
economic conditions in the project area are not very good and farmers’ income was low, which
resulted in that the farmers in the project area had no extra money to build the cement ditches,
ponds and other infrastructure for intermittent irrigation. In addition, farmers in the project area
have low education level, so they lack intermittent irrigation technology. So, the project has not
been implemented to generate GHG emissions for the purpose of their subsequent reduction,
removal or destruction. Since the conditions existing prior to the project initiation is the same as
baseline scenario, please refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario) to see the detail information.
Besides, this project does not affect the environmental conditions, including climate, hydrology,
topography, soils, relevant historical conditions, type of vegetation, ecosystems, etc., so, the
present and prior environmental conditions of this project are the same, which are listed as
follows.

1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
Generally, most rural forested private lands in King County are either managed for timber
production or for rural residential acreages. Properties managed for timber can have a variety of
management activities and intensities, but predominantly forests are clearcut at age ~40 years old
and then replanted to conifer. Outside of protected private land, most forests have been heavily cut
and regenerated one or more times since the late 1800s. Most managed properties undergo
additional silvicultural activities including a pre-commercial thin, hardwood management, and fill
planting understocked areas, etc. The general objective is fast timber growth to reduce rotation
ages and maximize financial returns. The forest industry is large and well established throughout
most of Washington State and King County.

In response to these adverse threats to the eco-region the Oromia Regional Government has attempted to
take concrete actions in recent years through policy and institutional development reforms. Establishment of
Oromia Forest and Wildlife Enterprise (OFWE) is one of these concrete actions taken. However, capacity
and resources are still major limiting factors for OFWE to achieve significant outcome in improved
management of the forests and associated natural resources in the eco-region. This BMERP is designed to
create a sustainable financing mechanism to help government and local communities build capacity and fill
critical resource gaps to bring meaningful changes in the management of natural resources and forests in
the eco-region.
The BMERP will build itself on works under implementation in the eco-region. From 2007 - 2012, Farm
Africa/ SOS Sahel Ethiopia in partnership with the Oromia Forest and Wildlife Enterprise implemented the
Bale Eco-Region Sustainable Management Programme (BERSMP), supported by the Netherlands,
Norwegian and Irish Embassies in Ethiopia. The programme aimed to contribute to the conservation and
sustainable development of the unique biodiversity and ecological functions of the greater Bale Mountains
Eco-region, whilst establishing and enhancing sustainable local livelihoods. The idea was to involve local
communities into a central role in the sustainable management of the area, and as the natural resource
management leaders, supported by government services, across the whole Bale Massif. The Bale
Mountains Eco-Region REDD+ initiative started as part of the bigger programme to address the financial
sustainability of the programme.

unfulfilled. Under business as usual, the3 eco-region will be on the verge of significant degradation
threatening not only the unique biodiversity of the area but livelihoods of millions of community that directly
and indirectly depend on goods and services from the eco-region. Action should be taken urgently to save
this globally important ecosystem.
1.4 Project Proponent G1.1
The BMERP proponent is the Oromia Forest and Wildlife Enterprise (OFWE), an autonomous fully
government-owned enterprise, established with regulation number 122/2009 issued in July 2009 by the
Oromia State Council under the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. The Oromia Forest and Wildlife
Enterprise owns concession for all of the forests and regionally administered wildlife related conservation
area in Oromia State. The concession area of OFWE covers a total of 367,700 Km2.
OFWE’s mission is to undertake conservation, sustainable development and utilization of the forest and
wildlife resources in its concessions through community participation; ensure supply of forest products
markets and services to domestic and international markets by enhancing forest industry; and subsequently
contribute to the regional and national socio-economic development endeavours.

The project proponent, OFWE, is currently responsible for the management of all forests in Oromia regional
state of Ethiopia. The forests were given to OFWE by concession to administer and manage it. OFWE has 9
branch enterprises, where Bale Mountains REDD+ mountains REDD+ project fall in two of the forest
enterprises: Arsi and Bale branches. The two branch enterprises with the OFWE headquarter support will be
responsible for the implementation of the BMERP.
In line with this they will perform the following:
 developing work plans and budgets
 implementation of activities such as law enforcement, community nursery establishment and
management
 support community forest management groups in the implementation of participatory forest
management
 closely work with legal bodies to enforce law
 ensure participation of other government agencies such as the office of agriculture, energy, etc in
the project implementation
 coordination of involvement of non-governmental organizations
OFWE staff profile:
OFWE has a total of3543 staffs working in the different branch offices and districts, out of which 117 staffs
are directly related to the Bale Eco-Region. These are working in two of the branch offices in Bale and West
Arsi within which the Bale eco-region forests fall.
Besides their professional background and skill in forest and biodiversity management the Bale REDD+
project has also provided series of training to build the capacity of the OFWE in REDD+ project management
and implementation. The Bale and Arsi branch office OPFWE staff were the one that conducted the forest
inventory work for the development of this PDD as well.
The Bale REDD+ piloting project (2012-2015) has also developed and is implementing Government and
Community staff capacity building plan (Government and community capacity building plan supplementary
material 25).
Farm Africa and SOS Sahel-Ethiopia, who supported OFWE in the development of the Bale REDD+ pilot
project and this PDD are also supporting the proponent in implementing the project activities until 2015, and
beyond through their current projects such as Bale REDD+ pilot project and SHARE projects (additional

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice
cultivation is conducted in Hulin within Jixi City, Heilongjiang Province of China, with a total
acreage of 20,206 ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project,
which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded
method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded
method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition
can emit a large amount of methane (CH ) because of anaerobic decomposition, the 4
intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase
and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.
This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results
in not only large amount of methane (CH ) emissions but also low rice productivity by 4
replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens
the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH emission 4
can be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an
estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 2.92 tCO e/ha for single-cropping rice is 2
expected.
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to
413,462 tCO e in the first 7 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 2
59,066tCO e. 2
This project aims to:
- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;
- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;
- Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers.

VCS Project Description
availability, climatic factors etc., the capacity utilized is less than best case scenario. Even though wind
farm developers promise about 25-30% of CUF per WTG during a year, this much generation is always
questionable. Effective CUF depends upon the availability of the wind and is not under the control of
supplier or owner of the WEGs. Depending upon the pattern, the CUF is estimated. Hence, there is always
a chance for fluctuation in CUF which would affect the production of electricity and in turn the associated
returns from the wind farm.
1.12 Demonstration to confirm that the project was not
implemented to create GHG emissions primarily for the purpose
of its subsequent removal or destruction.
The project activity is a Greenfield project activity. It is a wind power project activity with a totalled
installed capacity of 8.25 MW and is expected to generate 19152 MWh per annum. The Wind Energy is a
renewable energy source and hence the GHG emissions due to the electricity generation from the WTGs
are Zero. Hence, it is confirmed that the project was not implemented to create GHG emissions primarily
for the purpose of its subsequent removal or destruction.
1.13 Demonstration that the project has not created another form
of environmental credit (for example renewable energy
certificates).
Project Proponent, Savita Oil Technologies has not created GHG emission reduction or removal credits
through any other GHG Program for any form of environmental credit for the period (Monitoring Period)
which will be accounted under VCS. A letter of undertaking from the PP has been provided to validator for
the same.
Since the project proponent has applied for registration under the CDM process of UNFCCC, the GHG
reduction credit would be claimed up to the date of Registration of project activity in CDM to avoid double
counting with CDM.

VCS Project Description
For the implementation of the project, the project proponent has obtained land lease
deeds/sale deeds and has secured nodal agency clearance for commissioning of the WEGs in
the state of Gujarat. The project proponent has entered into the long term power purchase
agreement with the distribution utility for sale of power.
1.11 Identification of risks that may substantially affect the project’s GHG emission
reductions or removal enhancements
The risks that may affect the project’s GHG emission reductions are given below:
A. Wind electricity generation is risky and unpredictable due to the variability involved in
wind resources as well as its forecasting. This variability is due to the variability in the
wind speed and wind pattern, which in turn depends on weather cycle, climatic
conditions, etc.
B. The project is dependent on the utility provider for grid availability. If there is a grid
failure, the project will be unable to supply the generated electricity to the grid.
1.12 Demonstration to confirm that the project was not implemented to create GHG
emissions primarily for the purpose of its subsequent removal or destruction.
The project activity is primarily a renewable power generation facility which does not
produce any GHG emissions. The project activity has not been implemented to create GHG
emissions for the purpose of the subsequent removal or destruction of GHG emissions.
1.13 Demonstration that the project has not created another form of environmental
credit (for example renewable energy certificates).

VCS Project Description
September 1997 linking them to the prices of international fuel oils (FO) with
the linkage progressively increasing to 55%, 65% and 75% during the years
1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 respectively for general consumers. On May
27, 2005, Government hiked the price of natural gas supplied to Power and
Fertilizer sectors to Rs.3200 from Rs.2850 per thousand standard cubic
meters. At present, the gas for domestic use, Fertilizer and Power sectors are
still under APM. Once the APM is dismantled, which is likely to happen any
time, the price would go up4. In the above background, it is evident that the
cost of power generation is likely to go up. This is one of the key risk factor
affecting the project GHG emission reductions.
1.12 Demonstration to confirm that the project was not implemented to
create GHG emissions primarily for the purpose of its subsequent
removal or destruction.
The main purpose of the project activity is to generate electricity by utilising
the available gas in the Ramanathapuram ONGC zone. This leads to reduction
GHG emissions in the whole power generation process of the project activity.
Hence it is demonstrated that the project is not implemented to create GHG
emissions primarily for the purpose of its subsequent removal or destruction.
1.13 Demonstration that the project has not created another form of
environmental credit (for example renewable energy certificates).
If the project has created another form of environmental credit, the proponent must provide a letter from the program
operator that the credit has not been used and has been cancelled from the relevant program.
The project activity does not call for another environmental credit or not taken
under any other renewable energy certification. Hence the project activity has
not created another form of environmental credit.

• clearly state in its VCS PD all GHG programs for which the project has applied for credits and why the project
was rejected, such information shall not be deemed commercially sensitive information; and
• provide the VCS verifier and Registry with the actual rejection document(s) including explanation; and
• have the project validated against VCS program requirements.
The project activity is not applied for any other form of credits. Hence, the
rejection by other GHG programs is not applicable.

2 GENERAL
2.1 Project Goals, Design and Long-Term Viability
2.1.1 Summary Description of the Project (G1.2)
Tibet Ngari Improved Grassland Management Project (hereafter as “the project”) is located in
Ngari Region, Tibet Autonomous Region, China. Ngari is located in the southwest border of
China, the west of Tibet Autonomous Region and the north of Qinghai Tibet Plateau (Qiangtang
plateau). The objective of the project is to restore the ""black soil beach14"" and degraded
grassland ecosystem through reseeding native grasses and grazing management, such as rest
grazing and grazing prohibition, increase carbon sequestration, and promote local development.
The project proponent is National Forestry and Grassland Administration Northwest Investigation
and Planning Institute.
The project area is located in Ngari, covering Gar County, Burang County, Zanda County, Rutog
County, Gê'gyai County, Gêrzê County and Coqên County. According to the Participatory Rural
Appraisal (PRA) report. Before the implementation of the project, there were severely degradation
and desertification of the grasslands in this area due to the impact of climate change and human
activities, some grassland even degenerated into ""black soil beach"", the excellent forages in the
plant community almost disappeared, and the natural reproduction and renewal ability was very
low. According to the Parameters for Degradation, Desertification and Salinization of Rangeland
(GB19377-2003) in China15, moderately degraded grassland areas refer to the total grass yield
decreased by 21%-50% compared with that before degradation and the total grass yield
decreased by more than 50% compared with that before degradation is regarded as severely
degraded grasslands.
Totally, 373,467.02 ha of degraded grassland in Ngari have been managed sustainably including
rest grazing and grazing prohibition by fence building and seeding of local high-quality forage.
There are three main restoration measures as followed in the project:
(1) Rest grazing was implemented in moderately degraded grassland areas where grass yield
was 130-190kg/Mu 16 which decreased by 21-50% compared with the non-degraded
grassland. It is required that grazing shall not be allowed within 120 days when the grass
turns green every year (from 01-May to 31-August) through the construction of fence and
sustainable management. Through the implementation of rest grazing, 322,770.02 ha of
degraded grassland were managed sustainably.
(2) Grazing prohibition was implemented in seriously degraded grasslands where grass yield
less than 130 Kg/Mu which decreased by more than 50% compared with the non-degraded
grassland. Fence building shall be carried out in the grazing prohibition area. When the
construction is completed, grazing prohibition shall be implemented for 5 years. After that,
14 ""Black soil beach"" is an extreme type of grassland degradation caused by overgrazing, human factors, rat and
insect damage, climate warming and other factors.
15GB19377-2003 is a national standard document of the people's Republic of China which issued by The Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Affairs to assess the level of degradation, desertification and salinization of natural grassland.

CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3
under the premise of not affecting the normal growth of the improved grassland, the
grassland should be used reasonably and sustainably according to the local approved
livestock carrying capacity. For the project, totally 40,801.00 ha of degraded grassland have
been managed sustainably by grazing prohibition.
(3) Black soil beach restoration was implemented in moderately degraded grassland areas
where grass yield was less than 150 Kg/Mu and the proportion of bare patches in grassland
exceeds 40% which decreased by 21%-50% compared with the non-degraded grassland.
Reseeding grass, scientific fertilization and irrigation are carried out to restore grassland
vegetation greatly based on rodent and pest control on the ""black soil beach"" degraded
grassland in the project area. After reseeding the grass, the project area needs to be fenced
for 3 years to better restore grassland vegetation. Then under the premise of not affecting the
normal growth of the improved grassland, the grassland should be used reasonably and
sustainably according to the local approved livestock carrying capacity. The grass seeds
sowed were local high-quality forage such as Elymus nutans (Drooping tassel grass). In the
project, 9,896.00 ha of ""black soil"" degraded grassland have been reseeded grass.
In addition to these main restoration measures, the project also alleviates soil desertification and
restores grassland vegetation through grassland management measures to improve soil carbon
storage and local biodiversity, supplemented by daily management measures of other protection
projects, such as grassland fire prevention and rodent control, so as to ensure long-term
sustainable management of the project area. The project is estimated to generate GHG emission
removals of 11,698,413 tCO e in 40 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 2
292,460 tCO e. 2
The objectives of the project including:
Climate: Restore the degraded grassland ecosystem, increase grassland coverage, increase
grassland carbon sink function and reduce GHG emissions.
Community: Improve the livelihood of local herders, provide permanent and temporary job
opportunities for them, increase their income. Provide technical skills and training in sustainable
grassland management. Protect the sacred mountains (Kang Rinpoche) and holy waters (Lake
Manasarovar) widely respected by the Tibetan people which is conducive to the protection and
development of Tibet's traditional Zhangzhung culture. Zhangzhung culture is the traditional
culture of the Tibetan people, also known as the basic culture of Tibet. The traces of ancient
Zhangzhung culture run through all aspects of Tibet. From production to life, from folk custom17 to
belief, there is the shadow of Zhangzhung culture everywhere. For example, religious activities
such as offering sacrifices to mountain gods and turning mountains18 are all derived from the
Zhangzhung culture.
Biodiversity: Provide more suitable habitats for wild animals and increase local biodiversity.
17 The ancient Zhangzhung Buddha dharma occupies the supreme position in the traditional culture of ancient
Zhangzhung culture. It is the oldest Buddha Dharma in Tibet, the oldest Buddha Dharma in human history, and the
general source of all Buddha dharmas

generation from renewable sources” (EB58 Annex 7, 26 November 2010, version 12 valid from 17
Sep 2010 onwards)
The methodology refers to the following tools
• AM_Tool_01 version 05.2 “Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality”
• AM_Tool_02 version 02.2 “Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate
additionality” (this tool is not applicable to the project)
• AM_Tool_03 version 02 “Tool to calculate project or leakage CO emissions from fossil fuel 2
combustion” (this tool is not applicable to the project)
• AM_Tool_07 version 02 “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system”
B.2. Justification of the choice of the methodology and why it is applicable to the project
activity:
>>
This methodology is applicable to grid-connected renewable power generation project activities that (a)
install a new power plant at a site where no renewable power plant was operated prior to the
implementation of the project activity (Greenfield plant); (b) involve a capacity addition; (c) involve a
retrofit of (an) existing plant(s); or (d) involve a replacement of (an) existing plant(s).
Therefore, the methodology is applicable as the Proposed Project Activity is the installation of a
Greenfield, grid-connected wind power plant (a).
The methodology is applicable under the following conditions:

[['existing plant started commercial\noperation prior to the start of a\nminimum historical reference\nperiod of five years, used for the\ncalculation of baseline emissions\nand defined in the baseline\nemission section, and no capacity\nexpansion or retrofit of the plant\nhas been undertaken between the\nstart of this minimum historical\nreference period and the\nimplementation of the project\nactivity', 'represent a capacity addition to an\nexisting plant.', ''], ['In case of hydro power plants, one\nof the following conditions must\napply:\n• The project activity is\nimplemented in an existing\nreservoir, with no change in the\nvolume of reservoir; or\n• The project activity is\nimplemented in an existing\nreservoir, where the volume of\nreservoir is increased and the\npower density of the project\nactivity, as per definitions\ngiven in the Project Emissions\nsection, is greater than 4 W/m2;\nor\n• The project activity results in\nnew reservoirs and the power\ndensity of the power plant, as\nper definitions given in the\nProject Emissions section, is\ngreater than 4 W/m2.', 'Not applicable.

In addition, the applicability conditions included in the tools applied and referred to above apply as
follows:
Any conditions for the application of the tools are addressed in the sections below where the tools are
used, sections B.5 and B.6, showing that the tools are applicable to the Proposed Project Activity. In
addition, it is noted that:
• the project is a Greenfield project, therefore the AM_Tool_02 “Combined tool to identify the
baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality” is not required to identify the baseline scenario
of the proposed project; and
• the project is a wind power project, there are no fossil fuels used for electricity generation, so there
are no CO emissions and leakage from combustion of fossil fuels, and thus the AM_Tool_03 2
“Tool to calculate project or leakage CO emissions from fossil fuel combustion” is not applicable 2
to the proposed project.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice
cultivation is conducted in Suicheng District and Huanglo Town within Suixi County,
Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province of China, with a total acreage of 6,545 ha for double-
cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, the continuously flooded method
would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method
is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can
emit a large amount of methane (CH ) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent 4
flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane
emission reduction than the continuously flooded.
This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results
in not only large amount of methane (CH ) emissions but also low rice productivity by 4
replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens
the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH emission 4
can be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an
estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 9.15 tCO e/ha for double-cropping rice is 2
expected. Annual average estimation of GHG emission reductions from the project activity
is 59,906 tCO e/year, and the total GHG emission reductions are 599,060 tCO e during the 2 2
fixed 10 years crediting period.
This project aims to:
- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;
- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;
- Increase the number of local individuals who have relevant skills due to diversified
educational opportunities from trainings;
- Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers.

do not lead to changes of carbon pools in the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry
(LULUCF) sector.
In the absence of the project activity the Project Proponent (PP) would have treated the spent
wash in the anaerobic open lagoon system which would have resulted in emission of methane
enriched biogas into the atmosphere. In the absence of the project activity the PP would have
generated the steam by firing bagasse/biomass in a low pressure boiler and imported the
electricity from the grid. Thus, the generation of power in the project activity would result in
displacement of equivalent electricity generation in the grid and its associated CO emission. 2
Hence the Project activity reduces the CH4 emissions into the atmosphere that would have
been emitted from the treatment of the spent wash through open lagoon system and also
displaces the equivalent amount of electricity generation from the fossil fuel based grid
connected power plant and its associated GHG emissions

1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
As the project activity is the installation of a new grid-connected renewable power
plant/unit, does not involve generation of GHG emissions for the purpose of their
subsequent reduction, removal or destruction.
Prior to project initiation, the site was a vacant land. In absence of project activity, the
site will continue current practice i.e. equivalent amount electricity to be generated by the
project activity would have been generated from grid connected fossil fuel dominated
power plants.
The pre-project scenario and baseline scenario are the same, please refer to Section 2.4
for more details of the baseline scenario.
1.11 Compliance with Laws, Statutes and Other Regulatory Frameworks
In April 2015, Tunisia issued the Renewable Energy Law for Electricity Production
(No.74/2013). The Law seeks to encourage investment in renewable energy and
consequently increasing the contribution of renewable energy electricity to 30%
(equivalent to 3,800 MW) of total electricity production by 20301.
As renewable energy is encouraged in Tunisia, the project activity is in line with all
national/ local laws and regulations.

PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The Fresh Breeze afforestation project covers 4,269.82, hectares of land, which are adjacent to
cattle, on which forest plantations for obtaining high-value, long-lived timber products and for
sequestering large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere will be established. The
project activity is established in the states of Tabasco, Nayarit and Chiapas, Mexico.
The project activity is categorized as a grouped project due to the project foresees an average
expansion of 1,200 hectares per year, adding new project areas and instances from the future
years.
The project will result in a significant contribution to sustainable development of Mexico, mainly
through: i) increased employment and quality of employment; ii) rural development
(decentralization); iii) increased gross value of production; iv) improved fiscal balance; v)
biodiversity preservation and vi) improvement and preservation of soil quality.
Overall objective of proposed A/R project activity
The overall objective of the A/R activity is to contribute to mitigate climate change while meeting
the growing demand for quality wood products from well managed plantation forests and
contributing to sustain environmental management, community development and poverty
alleviation in Mexico.
Specific objectives of the proposed A/R project activity
1) Capture carbon dioxide through forest planting, generating high quality emission reductions in
greenhouse gases (GHG) that can be measured, monitored and verified. The project
participants strive to demonstrate that carbon sequestration from forest plantations is a viable
instrument to encourage private investment in the forestry sector, especially on degraded
lands.
2) Promote environmental conservation such as soil conservation, water sources and
biodiversity of the region, protection of flora and fauna species. Proteak UNO SAB de C.V.
has a protection program of species during and after the project implementation.
3) Take care of the biodiversity, creating biological corridors within our plantations
4) Socio-Economic development in the local communities through:
- Promoting tree plantation and afforestation activities in the local communities.
- Providing employment opportunities.
- Proteak UNO S.A.B. de C.V. supports its employees paying them social insurance (which is
not the common practice in other companies of the region).
5) Develop local infrastructure; including roads, health centers, water supply and communication
systems.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The proposed solar grouped project activity consists of an installation and implementation of
Solar Photovoltaic Power plants located in different departments within Colombian territory. The
implementation of grouped project activity ensures energy security, diversification of the grid
generation mix and sustainable growth of the electricity generation sector in Colombia.
All project activity instances within this grouped project activity will consist of single solar
renewable technology. Also, an individual project activity instance will either be small-scale
(having methodology AMS I.D version 18.0) or large-scale (having methodology ACM0002
version 19.0).
Before the implementation of the project activity, no power plants were installed at the project
site. The energy that will be generated by the grouped project is currently dispatched by other
power plants that are connected to the national grid, and that include fossil fuel power plants.
Hence, the baseline scenario and the scenario prior to project implementation are the same and
the project will help to reduce thermal power generation in the National Interconnected System
(SIN1) by providing renewable energy to the grid.
The first phase of the solar grouped project will have a total installed capacity of 229.45 MW, with
the installation of 742,289 Solar Photovoltaic units. The electricity generated by the grouped
project is expected to be around 447.09 GWh per year, which will be delivered to the SIN, to a
third party, or represents a project activity that results in savings of electricity that would have
been provided by the grid; avoiding part of the electricity generated by the grid-connected power
plants. Thus, it will contribute to sustainability by increasing the share of renewable energy and
reducing GHG emissions.
All the project activity instances i.e. renewable energy generation of Solar Photovoltaic – SPV
plants to be included in this grouped project, will be within Colombia only (see Table 1). Hence
the location and geographical boundary of the grouped project can be defined as Colombia. The
estimated annual emission reductions over a 10-year period of first crediting period from initial 6
project activity instances are 79,870 tCO e/year. The total emission reductions for 10 years 2
crediting period will be approximately 798,704 tCO e. 2

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
Based on the information provided in the UNFCCC website, 4 projects identified in step 2, have been
registered as CDM project activities. Therefore,
N = 37 all
- Step 4: within similar projects identified in Step 3, identify those that apply technologies that are
different to the technology applied in the proposed project activity. Note their number N . diff
All the projects identified in Step 3 apply technologies that are different to the technology applied in the
proposed project activity. Thus,
N = 37 diff
Step 5: calculate factor F = 1 – N / N representing the share of similar projects (penetration rate of diff all
the measure/technology) using a measure/technology similar to the measure/technology used in the
proposed project activity that deliver the same output or capacity as the proposed project activity.
F= 1 – 37 / 37 = 0.00
The proposed project activity is a “common practice” within a sector in the applicable geographical
area if the factor F is greater than 0.2 and N – N is greater than 3. all diff
As the factor F is not greater than 0.2 sand N -N is equal to zero, the proposed project activity is not all diff
a common practice.
As a result of applying the “Tool for demonstration and assessment of additionality” it is concluded that
based on conservative approaches and assumptions, the proposed project activity fulfills all the
additionality requirements demonstrating that it is additional.
Outcome of Step 4: As the outcome of Step 4 is that the proposed project activity is not regarded as
“common practice”, as demonstrated above, then, the proposed project activity is additional.
2.6 Methodology Deviations
The present project activity does not incur in any deviation from the applicable methodology.

View of the project participant on the contribu tion of the project activity to sustainable 
development  
 
The project proponent has essentially carried out investment in the project after analyzing the 
overall benefits to the community & environment. The approach is also in line with the sustainable development guidelines
2 of the Ministry of Environment & Forests (MoEF) of 
Government of India (GoI).  
 
1. Social well being: 
 
The wind installations are carried out depending upon the wind potential of the site and 
thus may not be implemented close to load centers. This results in the scattered 
implementation of wind projects thereby resulting in strengthening of local feeders and 
rural grids which in turn increases the availability of electricity in the nearby villages / 
suburban areas.   
Implementation of the project activity will also contribute towards meeting the electricity 
deficit in the state of Maharashtra / NEWNE regional grid of India. 
 
2. Environmental well being: 
 
The project activity essentially uses the available wind potential at the site which is 
converted into electricity; the operation of this facility is in tandem with environment as there are no emissions from the project activity. 
 
3. Economic well being: 
 Implementation of the project activity has helped in developing the local economy; create 
employment opportunities for the local skilled a nd semi skilled people, which is a priority 
concern for the Government of India.   
4. Technological well being: 
 
Increased interest in wind energy projects  will further push research efforts by technology 
providers to develop more efficient and better technology in  future.  Thus, the investment 
in candidate VCS project and other such projects will assist in promotion of better & new 
technologies.  
 
1.5 Project location including geographic an d physical information allowing the

"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology of this project is ACM0002 ""Consolidated methodology for grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources"", Version 12.1.0. This methodology is applicable to grid-connected renewable power generation projects that involve the installation, capacity addition, retrofit, or replacement of a power plant/unit of types such as hydro, wind, geothermal, solar, wave, or tidal power plants/units.

The methodology has certain conditions for applicability, such as the project activity being a greenfield plant or involving capacity addition, retrofit, or replacement. For capacity additions, retrofits, or replacements, the existing plant must have started commercial operation prior to a minimum historical reference period of five years, and no capacity expansion or retrofit of the plant should have been undertaken between the start of this minimum historical reference period and the implementation of the project activity.

For hydro power plants, the methodology applies if the project activity is implemented in an existing reservoir with no change in volume, or if the project activity is implemented in an existing reservoir where the volume is increased and the power density of the project activity is greater than 4 W/m2, or if the project activity results in new reservoirs and the power density of the power plant is greater than 4 W/m2.

The choice of methodology ACM0002 is justified for this project as it meets the relevant applicability criteria, including the installation of a new grid-connected renewable electricity generation plant and the construction of a new reservoir with a power density greater than 4 W/m2.

The greenhouse gases included in the project boundary and used in calculations of emission reductions are CO2 emissions from electricity generation in fossil fuel-fired power plants that are displaced due to the project activity. Minor emission sources such as CH4 and NO2 emissions during electricity generation are considered negligible and not included in the baseline calculation for conservatism and compliance with the methodology. Emissions from the construction and operation of the plant are also considered minor and not included in the baseline calculation.","

1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
The project activity correspond a new hydropower Plant installed at a site with no other power
generation plants operating prior to the project initiation.
The project consider a new reservoir with a flood area of 282 ha which 132 ha are now flooded by
the river.
The power density of the project activity is calculated according the installed capacity of the
hydropower plant after and before the implementation of the project activity (0 and 150,000,000 W
respectively) and considering the area of the reservoir measured in the surface of the water, after
and before the implementation of the project activity (132 and 282 ha respectively) (equation 12 in
section 3.2 indicates how to determined the power density). Therefore, the power density of the
project activity results in 100 W/m2.
The project main purpose involves the generation of renewable energy. The project replaces
energy from the grid partially generated by fossil fuel-fired power plants reducing the GHG
emissions. It will help Chile as a developing country to stimulate and commercialise the use of grid
connected renewable energy technologies that are required according to the article 150 bis of the
Chilean General Electric service Law Directive (DFL4/2006), published on 17 January /2006 in the

Project Description: VCS Version 4.1
A professional legal analysis has confirmed that the landowners have the exclusive rights to all
environmental services provided by their land, comprising any ecosystem payments that cover
the cost of improving natural resources management and conservation activities in their land in
exchange for the carbon finance benefits, including communal landowners known as Ejidos,
Ejidos are a type of communal land in Mexico in which the traditional communities that inhabit
the area have the collective property and usufruct rights of the land given by the Mexican State,
as indicated in Article 9 of Mexico’s Agrarian Law3.
The grouped project area currently encompasses a total of 175,880 ha in the state of Nayarit.
More project activity instances will be added to this grouped project in later PD versions. Within
the grouped project area there are currently nine project activity instances, which are mainly
ejidos.
BlueMX Mangrove A.C. has been collaborating and engaging with each ejidos’ authority, called
Ejido’s Commissariat, in order to establish partnerships and obtain their free, prior, and informed
consent (FPIC) to develop the project activities. The Ejido’s Commissariat is responsible for the
execution of the deal publicly agreed at the ejido’s assembly, as well as the governance,
representation, and administrative management of all ejido activities (Article 32, Mexico’s
Agrarian Law).
The project proponent signed agreements with each ejido and private landowners. The
agreements confirm the landowner’s or ejido’s endorsement to develop the project activities,
recognise the required ownership transfer of the carbon credits to BlueMX Mangrove A.C., and
confirms the landowners’ collaboration as key partners of the blue carbon conservation project.

1.17 Sustainable Development Contributions
The CCX Agroforestry project contributes to the sustainable development of the erstwhile fallow lands.
The project results in the achievement of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
specifically SDGs numbering 1,3, 8, 13 and 15.
SDG 1: No poverty
One of major sectors of India’s economy is agriculture. A large proportion of India’s population is
dependent on agriculture and allied activities for survival and income. When farmers own lands which
become degraded due to non-cultivation, their incomes are affected as they are often mostly small and
marginal farmers and their lands are not productive enough. These farmers/land owners have often only
one source of income making them vulnerable to poverty in case of crop failure. Therefore, carrying out
afforestation/reforestation on fallow or barren lands will increase and/or diversify their sources of
income. Diversified sources of income can make local communities comparatively less vulnerable and
more resilient to financial stresses. The carbon credits generated from such activity will result in carbon
income that can protect the local communities from poverty to some extent. The project activity
contributes to SDG 1 of working towards the goal of ‘No Poverty’
SDG 3 –Good health and well-being
Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen as part of their photosynthesis process. The

- DéguessiVert, a dynamic Malian agro-business.
- Novartis, a major international pharmaceutical company.
- Eco-Carbone, a French investor that
develops Jatropha and carbon projects
-
Novartis, DéguessiVert and Eco-Carbone have established
Jatropha Mali Initiatives (JMI) a joint venture company to manage
the project activities. One of the reason Novartis has entered the
project was to buy the carbon credits generated by the plantation.
For that matter, they bought a part of the credits in advance, which
allowed JMI to start its activities.

JMI and its international agro-scientific partners develop technical support throughout the
project, specifically developing best practices regarding variety selection, nursery technology and
agroforestry management techniques. For the
past five years, JMI has been promoting a 3 500smallholders based agroforestry system in Mali by
investing in and managing the establishment of sustainable Jatropha curcas plantations. The system
consists in planting rows of Jatropha in association with other crops.
In Kita circle, the total area cultivated with crops at the start of the project is 157 000 ha and JMI aims to
plant up to 15 000 ha of Jatropha by 2017 in this area.

1.1.2 A community based approach (approved by Agence Française de
Développement)
Jatropha is a rustic oilseed bearing tree, which adapts to a wide range of tropical climatic
conditions. Jatropha has been present for years in the ecologically-suited Sudano-Sahelian belt as live
fencing to protect gardens and food crops from livestock. According to recent studies, the Sahel today
would count about 10,000 km of this type of fencing3. Its seeds contain at least 30% oil, which is used
locally in JMI's project as a direct source of biofuel,to produce electricity or for the soap industry.
Biofuel is used locally where fossil fuel access is very difficult. Mali has no easy access to the sea, so
the demand for this kind of biofuel, which moreover is cheaper than fossil fuel, is very high. The sale of
these products will allow JMI to insure sustainable revenue to its farmers partners. The by-product of
the oil is a high quality organic fertilizer, used in the agroforestry systems. In addition, Jatropha trees
sequestrate carbon. With an average of 1,200 trees per hectare, a plantation can sequestrate up to
around 120 tCO2/ha over a period of 10 years.
size
Each
farmer chooses its plantation plot(s) on his own non-forested land. Therefore, the project's numerous
plantation plots are located all over Kita circle. In order to strengthen its partnership with local farmers,

Project Description: VCS Version 4.1
1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project is to change from continuously flooded regimes to intermittently flooded regimes
during rice cultivation in Youyang County, Chongqing City, China, with a total acreage of 16,548
ha of single-cropping rice. A total of 8,533 households (36,351 farmers) were involved in the
project. Without the project, local villagers would not have access to intermittently flooded
technology and intact facilities to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional
continuously flooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was
cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Due to the anaerobic
decomposition of organic matter in the paddy soil under flooded conditions, a large amount of
methane can be released, so the intermittently flooded method is more conducive to water
efficiency, improving rice yield and reducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded
method.
The implementation activities of the project include promoting intermittently flooded technology,
technical training for the farmers, facility repair and replacement, etc. According to the needs of
rice growth, farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only
saves water resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under
anaerobic conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to
the rice paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice
paddies in the rainy season.
The project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions by 365,337 tCO e in the first seven-year 2
period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 52,191 tCO e. The project aims to 2
reduce GHG and mitigate climate changes, increase rice productivity resulting in higher living
standards for local farmers and provide more job opportunities.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
This project is categorized as sectoral scope 14 (AFOLU) under Verra as justified in Section 1.3,

1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:
Captive Consumption
Prior to the project activity project proponent has been meeting its power demand from Tamilnadu Electricity Board
(TNEB) supply.The power that is being generated by the project activity was in the pre project scenario being produced
by the power plants connected to the southern grid.
1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG
emission reductions and/or removal enhancements:
Project proponent consumes considerable quantum of power for their operations. This power demand was met from
fossil fuel dominant state owned electric utility. The project activity would provide renewable power from wind energy
to Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) thereby reducing its reliance on non-renewable power from state owned
electric utility which is fossil fuel dominant. Thus the project activity would reduce Green House Gas (GHG) into the
atmosphere.

1.4 Project Eligibility
General eligibility
The KA'A PYAHU REDD+ project is eligible under the scope of the VCS program for responding to REDD+
activities, under an independent project scheme for the validation and verification of GHG emission
reductions in accordance with ISO 14064-2:2019 and ISO 14064-3: 2019. According with section 2.1 of
the VCS Standard (V 4.7), the activities of the project are not excluded.
AFOLU project eligibility
According to the VCS Standard V 4.7, eligible REDD activities are those that reduce net GHG emissions
by reducing deforestation and/or degradation of forests, which is the case of the KA'A PYAHU REDD+
project. Deforestation is the direct, human-induced conversion of forestland to non-forest land.
The analysis of land use categories in the project is based mainly on Mapbiomas2 which utilizes a satellite
imagery dataset used composed by Landsat 5 (Thematic Mapper), Landsat 7 (Enhanced Thematic
Mapper Plus) and Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager), Landsast sensors. The MapBiomas classification
scheme is a hierarchical system with a combination of LULC classes compatible with the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) and IBGE classification systems (Souza, et al., 2020). In this regard, the
project meets the internationally accepted definition of forest, and was qualified as forest for a minimum
of 10 years before the project start date. The definition of forest may include mature forests, secondary
forests, and degraded forests.
According with the VCS standard, activities covered under the REDD project category are those that are
designed to stop planned (designated and sanctioned) deforestation or unplanned (unsanctioned)
deforestation and/or degradation. In this context, as described in section 1.9, the actions carried out in
the KA'A PYAHU REDD+ project, with the creation of the association, are oriented towards the defense,
preservation and conservation of the environment. Specifically, by taking action to combat the
environmental and social impacts caused by the construction of the power line. This project activity stops
unplanned deforestation and reduces GHG emissions by stopping deforestation of forests.

site directly abuts neighbourhoods in all directions except to the south, where there is
approximately 70 meter buffer of woodland, and to the west, where a small 1 ha industrial
campus buffers additional communities.
The DPP facility is located at an elevation of 37 meters above sea level, in a humid tropical
savanna climate, with mean monthly precipitation of 120.4mm. The prevailing winds are from the
northeast, with mean wind speeds of 2.3 m/s. Sudden changes, caused by easterly winds, can
cause violent disturbances.
On the northeast section of the site location, an electric substation owned by ETED has two of ten
bays dedicated to Los Minas V and VI, while a third bay will be used by the combined cycle unit.
There is an abandoned shoe factory on the site, which will be removed upon construction. Two
fuel oil tanks from the decommissioned ITABOS unit 1 and 2 have already been removed. An
additional two fuel oil storage tanks remain, which served Los Minas III and IV before the fuel
switch to natural gas in 2003.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
The existing generating facility in Los Mina is a 210 MW plant, currently operating in open cycle
configuration. It comprises two natural-gas fired Siemens W501D5 (Originally Westinghouse
W501D5) combustion gas turbines with effective production of 105 MW each, and a WESTAC
generator. The turbines’ expected lifetime is at least 40 years and the generators’ expected
lifetime is at least 30 years. Both were commissioned on 1996, and therefore have more than 13
years left. Therefore the existing power plant was not implemented to generate GHG emissions
but to generate electricity. The proposed project will only make the power plant more efficient and
reduce the amount of GHG emissions per kWh generated.

The project activity also induces environmental and sustainable development benefits. The project activity
has introduced efficient high pressure cogeneration technology to the Indian sugar industry; reducing power
shortages in the state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) India; and, fostering sustainable economic growth through
promoting energy self-sufficiency and resource conservation in India’s sugarcane industry.
The policy to grow in a sustainable manner with commitment towards environment has been adopted by the
company. Decision to invest in a high pressure cogeneration system has been taken considering revenues
through sale of carbon credits under the clean development mechanism (CDM). Technology used in the
proposed activity is highly replicable as the country’s sugar mills produce large quantities of bagasse that
could be efficiently utilized to generate power.
Project’s contribution to sustainable development
The project activity contributes towards local, national and global sustainable development. It supports
India’s national policy to rely on clean power. The government’s clean power diversification strategy focus
on reducing wastage of energy combined with the optimum use of renewable energy (RE) sources.
The project activity substitutes, and hence decreases the dependence on primarily coal-based power
generation by the grid, thereby reducing carbon dioxide (CO )emissions. Coal which is a carbon intensive 2
fuel, and emits large quantity of GHGs is being used to meet around 70% of the country’s electricity
demand in 2005. Diversification and energy self-reliance by the sugarcane industry results in GHG
emission reduction. The project activity positively contributes towards the reduction in demand for carbon
intensive energy resources, efficient waste disposal and resource conservation.
The project activity has contributed to jobs creation in local rural area where cane growers (local farmers)
face highly cyclical income flows. It has created higher value jobs at the cogeneration facility. The inflow
of carbon credits from the Project’s net emission reductions would create a replicable model for the
country’s sugarcane industry, hence contributing towards sustainable development.

1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
Title: Grid Connected Electricity Generation from Renewable Sources
Reference: ACM 0002 (Version 18.1)3
For the determination of the baseline, the official methodology ACM0002 version 18.1, “Large-scale
Consolidated baseline methodology for grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources”4, is
applied, using conservative options and data as presented in the following section. This methodology refers
to five Tools, which are:
1. Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system (Version 6.0.0)5;
2. Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality (Version 07.0.0)6;
3. Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality (Version 07.0.0)7;
4. Tool to calculate project or leakage CO emissions from fossil fuel combustion (Version 03.0.0)8. 2
5. Tool to determine the remaining lifetime of the equipment (Version 01.0.0.)9
The first tool is used for baseline calculation and second tool is used for additionality assessment. As third
tool is the combination of the first and second tool, it is not used. Since no project emission or leakage
calculation is required for wind power project, fourth tool is not used, and finally to determine the remaining
lifetime of the equipment, fifth tool is used.
Since the project activity is a wind power plant, the respective sectoral scope is scope 1: “Energy Industry
– Renewable/Non-renewable Sources”. Project participant hereby confirms that this is not a grouped
project.

Leakage management
It is assumed that leakage manifests itself mainly as changes in land use (cattle ranching, timber,
etc.) in the project surroundings. These land-uses have become more uses have become more
economically attractive than the sustainable management of forest resources, mainly due to the
following factors: market pressure; occupation of border areas and other areas where law
enforcement and command-and-control are not effective; among other secondary factors.
The Project proponents will adopt proactive initiatives to fight these leakage sources, based on a
cooperative effort with local stakeholders to promote a new approach to forest and land use in
the region.
1.12 Project Location
1.13 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
• Ecosystem type:
The boundaries of the Tauari REDD+ Project are 100% covered by the Amazon Rainforest
biome. Three forest types are present in the project area: Submontane Open
Ombrophylous Forest (As); Submontane Dense Ombrophylous Forest (Ds); and
Submontane Semideciduous Forest (Fs)11.
• Current and historical land-use:
The project area is entirely forest for at least 10 years, as detailed in the section “1.3
Project Eligibility”. Sustainable forest management (SFM) has been carried out since
2013 (it started in União Farm and is currently carried out only in União and Continental
Farms).
The common practice established in the region is the invasion of the area and extraction
the wood that can be used for sale (commercially viable) and then clear the area using
fire, the clearing with fire takes place until it is feasible to install pasture for cattle.
Without the TAUARI REDD+ project, the project area is vulnerable to these external
threat’s (common practices).
11 The variations in these forest types were defined by the topographic and latitudinal variation:

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
In total, more than 2 300 ha shared by 1 800 small-scale farmers organized in Acopagro
cooperative will be reforested, in the North of Peru, Region San Martin, provinces of Mariscal
Caceres, Huallaga, Bellavista and Picota. The lands to reforest are cocoa plantations (64%),
“purmas” (unproductive lands2 : 33%), and others plantations (3%). The aim is to plant 2 million of
trees over a period of 6 years for a total of 1 150 000 tons of additional CO equivalent captured on 2
40 years.
Most of all, the Alto Huayabamba Project adds to sustainable development, offering social,
environmental and economic benefits.
- It helps people reforest and therefore bring an added value to their lands and ensure them a long-
term income that can be used to pay for the studies of their children or for their retirement pension.
As a consequence, it will provoke a local socio-economic development.
- It fights deforestation and its consequences, such as soil erosion, decrease of water availability,
natural disasters, landscapes degradation, and decrease of biodiversity. It also increases farmers’
awareness about these primordial issues.
- It promotes agro-forestry, an agricultural system which enables access to environmental services
recognized by the Peruvian law: conservation of water resources, preservation of biodiversity,
conservation of landscapes, protection against natural disasters (Forestry Law N° 27308, year 2000),
and fire risks control. Agro-forestry systems keeps on being the best strategy of management and
protection against the global climate change effects.
- Last but not least, it will create carbon credits, and therefore contribute to the climate change
mitigation through economic implication of large organizations.
The project is developed as a long-term project, with a project longevity of 80 years (maintenance of
management practices over 80 years)

Higher Operating and Maintenance (O&M) expenses: For the proposed
wind power project considered in this PDD, as per the O&M contract
between BPCL and Enercon, the O&M expenses will be INR 0.45
million/MW for the next eight years with an annual escalation. At
this rate at the end of the eighth year the annual O&M expense
would be INR 0.76 million/MW; an increase of 70% from the base
year’s O&M expenditure. Thus, in a scenario where the PPA (the rate
at which the power will be sold by BPCL to HESCOM) is kept constant
for ten years is likely to present a financial barrier to the
project developer. A scenario where O & M and costs are expected on
annual basis, a constant tariff for ten years presents a financial
barrier to a wind developer.
1.12 Demonstration to confirm that the project was not implemented to create GHG emissions

1.17 Sustainable Development Contributions
Sustainable Development Contributions Activity Description
The project is already registered with VCS and currently undergoing renewable of crediting period
(RCP) and verification. The contribution of this project activity in terms of following four indicators
of sustainable development as stipulated by the National CDM Authority (NCDMA) of India is
provided below:
Social wellbeing:
Since, the project activity is in a rural area, it will aid in the development of the region by
generating direct and indirect employment opportunities for the local people. The project activity
will also cause development of infrastructure like roads which will benefit the population in the
nearby areas.
Economical wellbeing:
The project has created a business opportunity for local stakeholders such as suppliers,
manufacturers, contractors etc. Use of wind as a source of energy reduces the dependence on
imported fossil fuels like coal and associated price variation thereby leading to increased energy
security. It will also narrow the existing electricity supply gap in the State of Maharashtra as well
as India.
Environmental wellbeing:
Since, the project uses renewable source for power generation; it does not lead to any
greenhouse gas emission. Avoidance of fossil fuel consumption results in reduction of Sulpher
oxides (SOx), Oxides of nitrates (NOx) and particulate matter emission thus avoiding air pollution.
The project activity is a step towards environmental sustainability by preventing exploitation and
depletion of a natural, finite and non-renewable resource (fossil fuels). Consumption of large
quantities of water that is required in generation of electricity in current mix of power plants is
avoided.
Technological wellbeing:
The technology leads to utilization of environmentally safe and sound technologies in power
sector. The project harnesses wind power potential in the region and encourages setting up such
projects in near future. Increased interest in wind energy projects will encourage Research &
Development efforts by technology providers to develop more efficient and better equipment in
future.
Sustainable Development Contributions Activity Monitoring
The project activity contributes towards sustainable development but PP does not monitor the
sustainable development contributions. Hence, PP has not reported the SD contribution below:

VCS Project Description
1.6 Duration of the project activity/crediting period:
The duration of project activity is 20 years. Ten years fixed crediting period is chosen
for the project activity and the Crediting period start date is 03/02/2007
Project start date: 03/02/2007 (Earliest Commissioning Date)
The commissioning date for each of the wind mill under the bundled project activity is
given in the table below.
Table 3: Commissioning details of the project activity
5

VCS Project Description
For the bundled project activity, the project start date is the earliest date of the
commissioning of any wind mill. As per the table above, the earliest commissioning
date is for the wind mill no. WEG No. 2148 which is 03/02/2007.
Therefore the start date for this bundled project is 03/02/2007.
Crediting period start date: 03/02/2007
The earliest crediting period start date under VCS 2007 is 28th march 2006, as per
section 5.2.1 of VCS 2007. The Crediting period start date for this bundled project is
03/02/2007.
The duration of the crediting period is 10 years.
1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:
In the absence of the project activity, an equivalent quantum of electricity would have
been generated by the fossil-fuel dominated Southern Regional Electricity Grid of
India4 generation mix. The same would in turn result in GHG emissions at the grid
end as per the carbon intensity of the above mentioned grid. This scenario has been
identified as the baseline scenario for the project activity under consideration (please
refer to section 2.4 of the VCS PD for further details).
1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG emission reductions
and/or removal enhancements:
The project activity under consideration entails electricity generation through wind-
mills by harnessing wind power potential, a natural and renewable source of energy.
The project is expected to generate and export of 16.14 million kWh (approx) per
year to the Southern Regional Grid of India. In the absence of the project activity, an
equivalent quantity of electricity would have been generated by the Southern Grid by
a majority of fossil-fuel fired power plants. The same would have resulted in GHG
emissions as per the carbon intensity of the grid-mix.
As per the combined margin carbon intensity of the 0.928 tCO /MWh for the 2
Southern Grid, the bundled project activity would there by result in total CO emission 2
reduction of 1,49,800 tonnes over the crediting period of 10 years. For detailed
calculation procedure and sample calculation tables of the GHG emission reduction
quantum from the project activity, please refer to Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of the
VCS PD.
1.9 Project technologies, products, services and the expected level of activity:
In wind energy generation, kinetic energy of wind blowing at high speeds is
converted into mechanical energy while passing through the wind-turbine. The
rotation of the turbine blades results in the rotation of the generator mounted on the
same shaft, thus generating electricity. As there are no GHG emissions associated
with wind electricity generation, the technology is widely recognized as clean
4 The Indian power grid system (or the National Grid) is divided into two regional grids namely NEWNE Regional Grid
and Southern Region Grid. These regional grids have independent state Load Dispatch Centres (LDCs) that manage
flow of power in their jurisdiction. Power generated by state owned generation units and private owned generation
units is consumed by the respective states. Power generated by central sector plants is shared by all states forming
part of the grid in a fixed proportion.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project and its Implementation Status
The main purpose of this project activity is to generate clean form of electricity through renewable
wind energy source. The project involves installation of 100 MW wind project in State of Gujarat.
Over the 10 years of first crediting period, the project will replace anthropogenic emissions of
greenhouse gases (GHG’s) estimated to be approximately 172,333 tCO e per year, thereon 2
displacing 183,960 MWh/year amount of electricity from the generation-mix of power plants
connected to the Indian grid, which is mainly dominated by thermal/fossil fuel based power plant.
The details of the project is mentioned in the table below
Scenario existing prior to the implementation of project activity:
The scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project activity, is electricity delivered to
the grid by the project activity that would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-
connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as reflected in the
combined margin (CM) calculations described in the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an
electricity system”.
Baseline Scenario:
As per the applicable methodology, a Greenfield power plant is defined as “a new renewable
energy power plant that is constructed and operated at a site where no renewable energy power
plant was operated prior to the implementation of the project activity”.
As the project activity falls under the definition of a Greenfield power plant, the baseline scenario
as per paragraph 22 of Section 5.2.1 of applied methodology is the following:
If the project activity is the installation of a Greenfield power plant, the baseline scenario is
electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by the
operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as
reflected in the combined margin (CM) calculations described in the “Tool to calculate the
emission factor for an electricity system”.
Hence, pre-project scenario and baseline scenario are the same.

1.1 Summary Description of the Project
Guohua Tongliao Kezuo Zhongqi Phase I 49.5 MW Wind Farm Project (hereinafter referred to as
“the project” or project “P”) is constructed and operated by Guohua (Tongliao) Wind Power Co.,
Ltd.
The project generates renewable power electricity by using the wind power resource, and
supplies electricity to Northeast China Power Grid (NECPG) replacing fossil fuel consumption and
thus reducing GHG (CO ) emissions. It involves installation and operation of 33 wind turbines 2
with the unit capacity of 1,500 kW and total capacity of 49.5 MW. It is estimated that the annual
generation of the proposed project will be 108,830MWh once fully operation, with a plant load
factor of 25.1%. The project lifetime is 21 years (including 1 year construction period).
The electricity currently generated by the Grid is relatively fossil fuel intensive, with a combined
margin emission factor of 1.0280 tCO /MWh. The proposed project is therefore expected to 2
reduce emissions of GHG of 111,877 tCO e per year during the first crediting period by displacing 2
electricity from NECPG.

1.8 Ownership
As stated in the (draft) Desa’a State Forest Management Plan 2018, the Desa’a forest is owned
and managed by the government of Ethiopia, specifically by the Ethiopian Environment, Forest
and Climate change (EECCC) Commission. Accordingly, the forest has been recognized and
registered as one of the National Forest Priority areas. Following this, in 1993 the boundary of
the forest area was demarcated by the Forest Inventory and Management Planning Division of
Forest and Wildlife Conservation and Development Department. For conservation and use
purposes, a management plan was prepared in 1997 by the initiative of the Tigray Regional State
Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Development (TBoARD).
The project proponent, WeForest and the Tigray State Government, through the Tigray Regional
State Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Development (TBoARD), have signed a MoU to develop this
ARR VCS project on these lands: “Memorandum of Understanding Between Tigray Regional State
Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Development and WeForest Ethiopia”.
The endorsement/agreement from the federal government/EECC is currently under negotiation.

The project has not sought or not received any other form of GHG-related environmental credits.
1.18 Additional Information Relevant to the Project
Leakage Management
The methodology applied refers to leakage due to activity shifting from inside the project area to outside
the project area as a result of the project’s intervention. Two types of activity shifting are considered in
the methodology: cropland cultivation and grazing.
In the case of the Desa’a project area, activity shifting of cropland cultivation is not applicable. In the
baseline scenario there is no cultivation of cropland taking place inside the project area.
In Desa’a, 82% of households use the forest as a source of fodder. Grazing inside the forest is historically
one of the factors that has led to the degradation and disappearance of forest in the project area. This
was mainly caused by browsing, trampling of seedlings, and removing olive tree branches as fodder. The
importance of this driver of deforestation has however diminished in the baseline scenario for a number
of reasons.
- The major reason is that access to grass resources in the project area is arranged through a cut
and carry system, whereby grass is collected in the forest and brought to the cattle, based on
the agreements of communities for when to harvest grass.
- Zero grazing was introduced in 2006 in Tigray. By the time of the evaluation in 2011, its
adoption rate was still low. However, over the past couple of years there has been the
beginnings of an increase in zero grazing and the adoption of improved livestock, promoted by
the Tigray government. Free grazing in the Desa’a Forest is not allowed unless there is a
written permit – see forest example the Forest Proclamation1. Sometimes there are illegal
practices in some parts of the forest, mainly in the areas along the border between Tigray and

2.1 Project Goals, Design and Long-Term Viability
2.1.1 Summary Description of the Project (G1.2)
Zhangjiakou Zhangbei County 2017 Afforestation Project (hereafter refer to as “the project”) is located in
Zhangbei county, Zhangjiakou City, Hebei Province of China. Hebei province is land locked and borders
Inner Mongolia to the northwest, Shanxi to the southwest, Liaoning to the east and Henan to the north. The
population of the province is 75.56 million. The project aims to plant native species on suitable land for
forest with low vegetative coverage rate for GHG removal whilst contributing to local sustainable
development goals.
20,750 ha (311,250Mu13) of the forest was planted on suitable lands for forest with low vegetative coverage
rate in Zhangbei county, which used to be poor sustainable ecological environment and rocky desertification.
Prior to the project, although the project area is suitable for planting trees, it lacks proper forestry
management, resulting in lower coverage of trees. Besides, there has never been any activity affecting the
local ecosystem in the project area14. By checking the afforestation plan, it was confirmed that, a small
number of trees existed in some project area before the project started, but the coverage rate was extremely
low. So, considering the lower forest coverage, Zhangbei Forestry Bureau determined that the project area
is suitable for afforestation after investigation, then the supplementary planting without disturbing the
existing trees was approved to increase the vegetative cover. All the trees were planted without disturbing
the existing trees in this report, and only the trees actually planted in this project were monitored. The
carbon credit of the original trees in the baseline scenario will not be monitored or counted in the actual net
GHG removals by sink.
The project involves Zhangbei county, with a total population of nearly 370,000. All these lands for
afforestation activities belong to the village committees. Zhangjiakou Sailin Landscaping Co., Ltd. (hereafter
referred to as Sailin Company) has been fully authorized by Zhangbei government, who represents all the
village committees, through a signed contract to act as the project proponent to implement project
management and monitoring, and to sell VCUs generated from the project so that Sailin Company
consolidate the offset resources into sizeable forestry offset projects. The implementation of the project
activity has provided 11,265 jobs for local villagers, it includes 11,200 temporary planting jobs and 65 long-
term technician jobs, among which 60 percent are women. The employment period of temporary planting
workers was during the planting period of the project, from 12 May 2017 to 15 July 2017.

2.1.1 Summary Description of the Project (VCS, 3.2, 3.6, 3.10, 3.11, 3.13, 3.14; CCB,
G1.2)
In February 2015, the State of Hawaiʻi Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) initiated the
Ola Hou – Restoring Hawaiʻi’s Native Forests project. Project activities were implemented by the project
proponent in Nakula Natural Area Reserve (NAR) and Kahikinui Forest Reserve (FR) in Leeward
Haleakalā in the county and island of Maui (State of Hawaiʻi), and include construction, expanding and
maintaining fence line, controlling and removing feral livestock and non-native ungulates, planting
native trees and plants, and monitoring and removing invasive species. Additional planting activity was
performed in partnership with the Leeward Haleakalā Watershed Restoration Partnership (LHWRP)
organization. The Nakula NAR and Kahikinui FR have been subjected to grazing by cattle, feral goats
and hogs for over 100 years12. Over this time, subject to this grazing pressure, the forest gave way to
non-native savannah grassland composed almost entirely of invasive grass species. Due to a large
population of feral ungulates and the steep terrain in this region, vegetation loss leading to erosion of
topsoil has led to further degradation and loss of carbon stocks from the project sites. By planting and
facilitating the natural regeneration via removal of feral ungulates, native woody species such as koa
(Acacia koa), ʻōhiʻa (Metrosideros polymorpha), olopua (Nestegis sandwicensis), mamane (Sophora
chrysophylla), and pukiawe (Styphelia tameiameiae) are being restored, creating essential habitat for
rare native flora and fauna, and carbon is being sequestered. These project instances are expected to
remove an average of 287 t CO annually from the atmosphere over the project lifetime. 2

VCS Project Description
1.4 A brief description of the project:
The project activity is an initiative by Ms. Aishwarya Rai towards clean energy generation by
means of installation of 2 state-of-art WEGs of individual capacity 1.25 MW each, at village
Kotari near Soda Mada, District Jaisalmer in the State of Rajasthan aggregated to a total
installed capacity of 2.5MW.
The objective of the wind power project activity is to generate renewable electricity using
wind power resources and to sell the generated electricity to the State Electricity Utility
RVPNL (Rajasthan Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited).
The project activity is expected to generate 4899 MWh per annum. Had this amount of
electricity been produced by conventional fuel dominated power plants, it would lead to net
emission of 4439 tonnes of CO e per annum. Hence, Project Proponent (PP) decided to 2
harness renewable energy entailing to the establishment of these wind machines.
The generated electricity is being supplied to the RVPNL (herein after referred as Jaipur
DISCOM). The Rajasthan State grid forms part of the NEWNE Regional Grid of India (Since
August 2006, all regional grids except the Southern grid have been integrated and are
operating in synchronous mode, i.e. at same frequency. Consequently, the Northern, Eastern,
Western and North-Eastern grids are treated as a single grid and is being named as NEWNE
grid) which depends mainly on fossil fuels and this project activity contributes to reduced
greenhouse gas emissions caused by reliance on fossil fuels.

VCS Project Description
The nearest railway station is Jaisalmer Junction and the nearest airport is at Jaisalmer. The
airport is opened for flights only during tourist season.Nearest Highway is NH-15 (Jaisalmer
– Barmer).
1.6 Duration of the project activity/crediting period:
Project Start Date:
As per VCS 2007.1, the project start date shall not be before 1st January, 2002. The VCS
project activity start date is 30th September, 2004 which is the date on which the project
activity began reducing or removing GHG emissions i.e. the date of commissioning of both
the Turbines.
The VCS crediting Period will last for ten years starting from 1st April 2006 up to 31st
March 2016.
However, since the project is currently under CDM validation, it is to be noted that the
crediting period under VCS will last till the date of Registration of project under
CDM. Details are provided in section 1.13 of the PD below.
1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:
Electricity in Rajasthan is mainly generated from the fossil fuel dominated power plants (see
section 2.4 for details). In the absence of the project activity, equivalent amount of electricity
would have been generated by the operation of fossil fuel dominated power plants. The
electricity grid is power deficit and hence the new capacity has to be added in the grid system
which would be fossil fuel dominated electricity generation.
PP has installed the project activity at a location which is a barren land and there is no
agriculture activity being undertaken at this site. There is neither any industrial activity
undertaken nor any human displacement done at the site because of the project activity.
The purpose of the present project activity is to harness renewable resources in the region,
and thereby displacing non- renewable natural resources and ultimately leading to sustainable
economic and environmental development. The project activity includes development,
design, engineering, procurement, finance, construction, operation and maintenance of wind
energy based electric generating stations supplying electricity to the RVPNL grid.
1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG
emission reductions and/or removal enhancements:
The project activity is a Greenfield wind power project activity with a totalled installed
capacity of 2.5 MW and is expected to generate 4899 MWh per annum. The electricity thus
generated is sold to the Jaipur DISCOM. In the absence of the project activity, equivalent
amount of electricity would have been generated by the operation of existing/proposed grid
connected fossil fuel dominated power plants. The Project activity will thus reduce the

"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology of this project involves the application of the SOCIALCARBON methodology to improve long-term sustainability conditions. It also ensures that all legal requirements are met and there are no predicted environmental impacts. The project is uniquely geographically identified with no logistical barriers. It does not double count greenhouse gas emissions during the ten-year renewable crediting period.

The project applies several small-scale methodologies and tools approved under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), including:
- Category AMS-I.E.: Switch from Non-Renewable Biomass for Thermal Applications by the User
- TOOL03: Tool to calculate project or leakage CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion
- TOOL05: Baseline, project and/or leakage emissions from electricity consumption and monitoring of electricity generation
- TOOL07: Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system
- TOOL11: Assessment of the validity of the original/current baseline and update of the baseline at the renewal of the crediting period
- TOOL12: Project and leakage emissions from transportation of freight
- TOOL16: Project and leakage emissions from biomass
- TOOL30: Calculation of the fraction of non-renewable biomass

The methodology is applicable for project activities that use renewable biomass to generate thermal energy and generate less than 45MW of energy, which is the case for this project. There are no similar registered project activities in the region, and the project activity does not save non-renewable biomass accounted for by other registered project activities.

The utilization of firewood from areas without sustainable management is not considered a renewable source of biomass. Firewood from reforestation activities, on the other hand, is considered renewable if it meets certain criteria outlined by the UNFCCC definition of renewable biomass.","

2.2 Applicability of Methodology
The methodology is applicable for project activities that avoid greenhouse gases emissions by
using renewable biomass in order to generate thermal energy. In addition, the methodology is
applicable if the project generates less than 45MW of energy, which is accomplished by the
project as it generates 6.98 MW.
There are no similar registered project activities in the region of the project activity once
Sustainable Carbon - Projetos Ambientais LTDA made a research and did not find any registered
small-scale CDM Project. Therefore, the proposed project activity is not saving the non-renewable
biomass accounted for by the other registered project activities.
The utilization of firewood from areas without any kind of management cannot be considered a
renewable source of biomass, since it interferes in the carbon pools and increases the carbon
emissions to the atmosphere, turning greenhouse effect even worse. Moreover, the native wood
provided from areas without a reforestation management plan does not fit any of the options of
UNFCCC definition of renewable biomass in Annex 18, EB 2320.
Firewood coming from reforestation activities is considered renewable according to option I of the
UNFCCC definition of renewable biomass (Annex 18, EB 23), as it fits all the assumptions below:
“The biomass is originating from land areas that are forests21 where:
(a) The land area remains a forest; and
(b) Sustainable management practices are undertaken on these land areas to ensure, in
particular, that the level of carbon stocks on these land areas does not systematically decrease
over time (carbon stocks may temporarily decrease due to harvesting); and
(c) Any national or regional forestry and nature conservation regulations are complied with.”

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
Heilongjiang Zhaoyuan Improved Agricultural Land Management Project (hereinafter referred to
as “the project”) is located in Zhaoyuan County, Daqing City, Heilongjiang Province, China. The
purpose of the project is to adopt improved agricultural land management practices to prevent
the severe soil degradation caused by pre-existing conventional tillage in local crop land.
The improved agricultural land management practices of the project focus on no-tillage on fields
evenly mulched with crushed straw for two or three years, followed by plowing or subsoiling once
and continued no-tillage for another two or three years. No-tillage can effectively reduce the
loosening of the surface soil layer and soil disturbance, reduce the loss of water and nutrients in
the soil, ensure the retention of organic matter in the soil, reduce the degree of compaction of
the tillage equipment on the tillage soil layer, and preserve appropriate space for the growth of
crops, which is convenient for ventilation and keeps the soil with good water storage capacity.
The application of no-tillage sowing has solved the problem of sand blowing in bare farmland to
a certain extent and played a role in windbreak and sand fixation. No-tillage can maximize the
protective effect of straw mulching on soil.
The project plans to implement improved agricultural land management practices in 87,479 ha
corn field in the first crediting period to increase soil organic carbon (SOC). The project proponent
not only introduced more efficient and appropriate tillage method with Zhaoyuan Agriculture and
Rural Affairs Bureau (ZARAB) to the farmers, but also provide technical training and support to
the farmers.
The scenario existing prior to the project’s implementation is primarily conventional tillage with
straw mulching, which increase soil disturbance and the loss of soil organic matter (SOM).
During the first crediting period from 07-Apr-2021 to 06-Apr-2031, the project is expected to
generate GHG emission removals of 1,315,100 tCO e, with an average annual GHG emission 2
removal of 131,510 tCO e. 2

1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
1.10.1 Climate:
Weather data collected at La Milpa Field Station on the north-western Rio Bravo Conservation and
Management Area (but outside the defined Project Area) has provided a good estimate of weather
patterns. Since conditions alter across the Rio Bravo, those in the south and east can be assessed from
observations from the weather stations at Tower Hill (near Orange Walk Town) and Spanish Lookout.
Overall the area experiences a sub-tropical moist climate with marked wet and dry seasons, dominated
by weather systems moving through the Gulf of Mexico and western Caribbean. The wet season is May –
November and the dry season is December to April. Temperatures are fairly constant across inland
northern Belize, averaging 27o C (81oF), but rainfall increases from north-west to south-east. Thus mean
annual rainfall at La Milpa over the period 1995-2005 has been 1239 mm (49”) while that at Tower Hill is
somewhat higher (1353 mm, 53”) and Spanish Lookout is higher again (1546 mm, 61”). These data
suggest that the eastern RBCMA should receive 1440-1500 mm (57-59”) per annum. The La Milpa
rainfall and that estimated for the eastern RBCMA is rather lower than those given in previous
descriptions of the area. This conforms to a slight drying trend over the past decade (Meerman &
Cherrington, 2005).

100% of the respondents have some knowledge and understandings about wind farm projects. 
100% of the respondents do not disagree with the devel opment of the Project. About 87% of them believe 
that the Project will have overall positive impacts, such as “increase of job opportunities and income”, 
“improvement of living standard”, on their livelihoods, while the others believe there will be little impact 
on their livelihoods or do not know the impacts.  Among the negative impacts mentioned, the main con cerns are infield occupation and plants damage 
(81%),  noise (19%), waste water and electro-magnetism pollution (6%).  The main additional comment or suggestion on the Project construction is “accelerate the construction 
process and generation as soon as possible”, which reflected the support from the stakeholders. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The survey shows that the proposed project receiv es strong support from local people, which is closely 
linked to the fact that the majority of local village rs have some understandings with wind power projects. 
Most of the respondents believe that the project will have overall positive impacts on their livelihoods 
with better standard of living and reduced tariff which is quite high now. Among the negative impacts, 
the two main issues concerned are land use and envi ronmental pollution. However, as the environmental 
impact assessment demonstrates, both impacts only occur during construction period, and accompanied by mitigating measures such as enclosed operation, w aste landfill, and restored vegetation, the impacts 
will be minimized after the construction.  The survey forms are ava ilable from the company.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
Winsome Textile Industries Ltd. (hereinafter also called as WTIL), a leading manufacturer of
textile product, started its operations in 1980 in Baddi, Himanchal Pradesh, India. WTIL has
given special stress to minimise contamination, both at pre-spinning and post-spinning stages
by adding machines like Vision Shield in Blow Room and Schlafhorst-338 with LOEPFE - 9001
(SIRO CLEANER) Contamination Control Channel at winding stage. Further addition was to
generate renewable electricity for captive consumption to minimise carbon foot print in long
term.
The project activity involves power generation from a 3.5 MW hydroelectric project based on
Manuni Khad stream, a tributary of river Beas at village Khaniara, Dharamshala, District
Kangra, Himachal Pradesh. The project activity is a run-of-river project being developed by
M/s Winsome Textile Industries Ltd. The project activity comprises 2 Numbers of Pelton
Turbines each with a generator output capacity of 1750 kW for generation of electricity.
The project was allotted to the M/s Winsome Textile Industries Ltd. on a Build, Own, Operate
and Maintain (BOOM) basis for a period of 40 years. Wheeling and Banking Agreement (PPA)
is being signed with the Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board (HPSEB), the generated
electricity will be used for captive consumption at its manufacturing unit Baddi.
The purpose of the project activity is to produce renewable energy using hydro power for
captive consumption. In the absence of the project activity equivalent amount of electricity
would have been generated by the operation of grid connected fossil fuel based power plants.
The Project activity thus reduces the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs)
in to the atmosphere associated with the equivalent amount of electricity generation from the
fossil fuel based grid connected power plant. The project activity has commissioned both the
turbine on 31/03/2017.
The estimated annual average and the total CO e emission reduction by the project activity 2
over the first renewable crediting period of 10 years are expected to be 17,619 tCO e and 2
176190 tCO e respectively. 2

VCS Project Description
In the absence of the project activity, an equivalent quantum of electricity would have
been generated by the fossil-fuel dominated Southern Regional Electricity Grid of
India6 generation mix. The same would in turn result in GHG emissions at the grid
end as per the carbon intensity of the above mentioned grid. This scenario has been
identified as the baseline scenario for the project activity under consideration (please
refer to section 2.4 of the VCS PD for further details).
1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG emission reductions
and/or removal enhancements:
The project activity under consideration entails electricity generation through wind-
mills by harnessing wind power potential, a natural and renewable source of energy.
The project is expected to generate and export of 20.965 million kWh (approx) per
year to the Southern Regional Grid of India. In the absence of the project activity, an
equivalent quantity of electricity would have been generated by the Southern Grid by
a majority of fossil-fuel fired power plants. The same would have resulted in GHG
emissions as per the carbon intensity of the grid-mix.
As per the combined margin carbon intensity of the 0.928 tCO /MWh for the 2
Southern Grid, the bundled project activity would there by result in total CO emission 2
reduction of 194560 tonnes over the crediting period of 10 years. For detailed
calculation procedure and sample calculation tables of the GHG emission reduction
quantum from the project activity, please refer to Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of the
VCS PD.
1.9 Project technologies, products, services and the expected level of activity:
In wind energy generation, kinetic energy of wind blowing at high speeds is
converted into mechanical energy while passing through the wind-turbine. The
rotation of the turbine blades results in the rotation of the generator mounted on the
same shaft, thus generating electricity. As there are no GHG emissions associated
with wind electricity generation, the technology is widely recognized as clean
technology. An upwind7 Horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT)8 is used in the project
activity to generate power.
o Main Tower: This is what holds the windmill up into the airflow.
o Blades: The blades are basically the sails of the system. They are flat
objects connected to the centre shaft that converts the push of the
wind into a circular motion. When the wind forces the blades to move,
it has transferred some of its energy to the rotor
6 The Indian power grid system (or the National Grid) is divided into two regional grids namely NEWNE Regional Grid
and Southern Region Grid. These regional grids have independent state Load Dispatch Centres (LDCs) that manage
flow of power in their jurisdiction. Power generated by state owned generation units and private owned generation
units is consumed by the respective states. Power generated by central sector plants is shared by all states forming
part of the grid in a fixed proportion.

"What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?","Based on the provided project description, the project sector would be Forestry and Land Use. The project involves changing the method of rice cultivation from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded conditions, which falls under the category of Improved Cropland Management (ICM) within the sector of Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU). This project aims to reduce methane emissions, increase rice productivity, and provide job opportunities.","

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice
cultivation is conducted in Nanbu County within Nanchong City, Sichuan Province of China,
with a total acreage of 15,978 ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this
project, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was
cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter
in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH ) because of 4
anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water
conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously
flooded.
This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results
in not only large amount of methane (CH ) emissions but also low rice productivity by 4
replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens
the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH emission 4
can be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an
estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 3.50 tCO e/ha for single-cropping rice is 2
expected. Annual average estimation of GHG emission reductions from the project activity
is 55,905 tCO e/year, and the total GHG emission reductions are 559,050 tCO e during the 2 2
fixed 10 years crediting period.
This project aims to:
- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;
- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;
- Increase the number of local individuals who have relevant skills due to diversified
educational opportunities from trainings;
- Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers.

According to the requirements of Chinese environmental protection laws and regulations，there
is a Statement for Environmental Impact Assessment of the project released by Heishan
Environmental Protection Bureau. The Statement ensures that:
The proposed project does no harm to the local environment, and it is not included in the
categories9 that need Environmental Impact Assessment, it doesn’t need an Environmental
Impact Assessment. The local Environmental Bureau also gave a document to prove the
significant positive environment impacts.
In addition to reducing the GHG emissions, the proposed project also has positive environment
impacts. With the biogas digester constructed in households, animal manure management system
can be improved, the environment in the pigpen and latrine can be improved and the odour can
be reduced. With the new pigpen and latrine, less disease on human and animal will be caused
and transmitted by bacterial and virus. And all the manure is fed into the tank, which will reduce
pollution to soil and water caused by direct discharge of animal waste. Using biogas for cooking
is good for improving indoor air condition. Cooking with coal produces a large amount of SO , 2
CO and smoke, which is harmful to human’s health. But cooking with CH ,only producing H O 4 2
and CO , is environmental friendly. In general, the environmental impacts are: 2
 GHG emissions being strongly mitigated in comparison to baseline treatment alternative;
 The environment and odour in pigpen and latrine being improved;
 Improving the indoor air condition, protecting human from SO ,CO,smoke; 2
 Avoiding pollution to soil and water caused by direct discharge of animal waste.
 Using biogas slurry instead of traditional non-fermented animal manure. The process of
generating biogas will kill many of the pathogenic bacteria found in manure that can be passed on
to humans causing intestinal diseases.
As indicated above, the proposed project can improve the rural environment and living
conditions in the project areas while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. No significant negative
environment impacts have been identified Heishan Environment Protection Bureau approved the
proposed project on December 10, 2007.

Thus the project activity aims at reducing the GHG emissions that would have been generated by using coal as a fuel for co-generation plant.', 'project_state_province': 'Chhattisgarh', 'project_country': 'India', 'project_latitude': 21.08, 'project_longitude': 81.08}","5","3","5","5","3","0.19","196","-"
"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology used in this project is ACM0008 - ""Abatement of methane from coal mines"" (version 08.0). This methodology applies to project activities that aim to use or destroy methane extracted from working or abandoned coal mines. The project activities include treating the captured methane either by destroying it without energy production (e.g., flaring) or by using it to produce energy (such as electricity, heat, or vehicle fuel). 

The project in question falls under category (b) as it uses low concentration coal mine methane (CMM) from the Jinyan coal mine for power generation to supply electricity to the coal mines where the project is located. 

Emission reductions in this project are claimed by displacing or avoiding energy from other sources. The emissions reduction comes from two sources: 1) Methane (CH4) emissions resulting from previously vented gas that will be captured and destroyed in the project scenario, and 2) CO2 emissions from the production of the equivalent amount of electricity replaced by the project that would have otherwise been purchased from the CSPG. 

The project applies various tools and methodologies such as the ""Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality"" (version 07.0), the ""Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system"" (version 07.0), the ""Baseline, project and/or leakage emissions from electricity consumption and monitoring of electricity generation"" (version 03.0), ""Common practice"" (version 03.1), and ""Investment analysis"" (version 11.0).","

wastes of the project will be properly treated with a clear direction and will not cause secondary
pollution to the surrounding environment.
In conclusion, the environmental impact during the project construction will be temporary and
not significant, and the environmental impact during the project operation will be minor. The
project can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution caused by methane
release and coal-fired power generation. The Project owner takes appropriate measures to
minimize adverse environmental impacts.

"What are the methodologies of this project?","Based on the provided context, the methodology of this project involves the following:

1. Project Boundary: The project boundary is defined as the notional margin around the project within which the project's impact, in terms of carbon emission reductions, will be assessed. For the Cuyamel project, the boundary includes emissions from activities that occur at the project location.

2. System Boundary: The system boundary for the proposed project is defined as the national grid in Honduras. The project boundary for the baseline includes all direct emissions related to the electricity produced by the facilities and power plants to be replaced by the Cuyamel project. This includes emissions from displaced fossil fuel use at power plants.

3. Baseline Development: The baseline for the proposed project activity is determined using the methodology specified in the applicable project category for small-scale CDM project activities contained in Appendix B of the simplified M&P for small-scale CDM project activities. Specifically, for project category Type 1.D (AMS-I.D), the appropriate baseline is the average of the ""approximate operating margin"" and ""build margin.""

1.13 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
Intermittent flooded water regime requires that irrigation and drainage can be controlled
according to the growth needs of rice during its cultivation. However, prior to the project initiation,
economic conditions in the project area are not very good and farmers’ income was low, which
resulted in that the farmers in the project area had no extra money to build the cement ditches,
ponds and other infrastructure for intermittent irrigation. In addition, farmers in the project area
have low education level, so they lack intermittent irrigation technology. So, the project has not
been implemented to generate GHG emissions for the purpose of their subsequent reduction,
removal or destruction. Since the conditions existing prior to the project initiation is the same as
baseline scenario, please refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario) to see the detail information.
Besides, this project does not affect the environmental conditions, including climate, hydrology,
topography, soils, relevant historical conditions, type of vegetation, ecosystems, etc., so, the

CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3
2 GENERAL
2.1 Project Goals, Design and Long-Term Viability
2.1.1 Summary Description of the Project (G1.2)
Komaza is a social enterprise founded in 2006, incorporated in the USA with operations in Kenya. It was
started with the mission of getting subsistence farmers out of poverty by building a profitable forestry
business that connects thousands of small-scale tree farmers to high-value wood markets.
Komaza’s business model is unique in its promotion of decentralized smallholder forestry. Komaza works
with smallholder farmers on their own land, where the land remains under the ownership of the farmers,
but the trees are owned by Komaza, and the benefits are shared between the parties. Collectively, small-
scale farmers possess enough land and labor resources to plant billions of trees, overcoming major barriers
to commercial forestry in Kenya (namely access to land and high establishment cost), while developing
particularly strong environmental benefits.
● Scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project
Komaza currently operates in two main locations, Coastal Kenya within Kilifi and Kwale counties, and
Central Kenya within Nyandarua county.
In Coastal Kenya, a large share of the native ecosystem has already been lost, leaving a mosaic of lowland
forest patches, bushlands and scrublands with mostly infertile soil. Farmers aren’t used to planting trees,
and terrestrial reforestation and afforestation efforts remain limited due to difficulties associated with the
fragmented nature of the landscape and insufficient access to finance. Because of the increasing pressure
from local economic development, in the absence of intervention it is likely that further land degradation
would occur, causing significant loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services.
In Central Kenya, a more fertile area than the coast, there is also environmental degradation caused by
land use changes and poor agricultural practices. Some farmers already plant trees for timber and
fuelwood, but not at a pace or in a way that can reverse the ongoing degradation, with large amounts of
agricultural land still left fallow. In the absence of new large-scale, attractive tree growing initiatives, it is
likely that further land degradation would occur and increase the vulnerability of smallholder farmers to the
impacts of climate change.
● How Komaza generates GHG emission removals
Komaza works with smallholder farmers who own degraded, unused, or sub-utilized plots, to turn this land
into productive forestry (afforestation). Komaza provides high-quality seedlings, training, as well as tree
management and harvest services to farmers. No upfront cash investment nor forestry knowledge is
required to participate. Farmers receive a fair payment at harvest, based on the volume of wood removed
from the farm and the prevailing market prices.

CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3
As of 2022, Komaza has established over 8,000 ha of new commercial forests and has planted close to 7
million trees involving over 25,000 smallholder farmers. Three species are planted namely the fast-growing
hybrid Eucalyptus grandis x camaldulensis, Eucalyptus grandis and indigenous species Melia volkensii, all
suited for the local climatic conditions and product needs.
The project will include all Komaza’s planting since 2017 and future planting in Kenya. Over the lifetime of
the project (30 years) Komaza will plant at least 45,088 ha of smallholder plantations with rotations of 8, 10
and 15 years for Eucalyptus (Central), Eucalyptus (Coast) and Melia (Coast) respectively, both in replanting
and coppicing management regimes. This grouped project will result in an annual average GHG removal
of 212,780 tons over 30 years and a total GHG removal (long-term average) of 6,383,391 tCO2e.
● Komaza’s climate, community and biodiversity objectives
Co-benefits from this project include, but not limited to:
- New income opportunity for smallholder farmers, which doesn’t require any cash investment and
is climate-resilient
- Dissemination of forestry knowledge and skills in the communities, including better environmental
awareness
- Women empowerment through innovative contract and payment model
- Increased forest cover in a landscape that provides habitat for many species
- Reduced land degradation and desertification
- Reduced pressure on natural forests and other protected ecosystems

The Project utilizes coal mine methane (CMM) with a methane concentration of 16% to generate electricity, and the electricity generated is fed into the North China Power Grid for the self-consumption of the Guzhuang Coal Mine, while the heat output is recovered by a waste heat hot water boiler, replacing the original coal-fired boiler for heating in the mine area. The Project Owner is Yangquan Zhonglian Energy Technology Co.\r\nThe purpose of this project is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the combustion of methane in the coal mine gas during the power generation process. No coal bed methane (CBM) or ventilation air methane (VAM) utilization is involved. The total installed capacity of the project is designed as 8MW, with eight 1000kW gas-fired internal combustion generator sets, which utilize coal mine gas with a concentration of less than 30% to generate electricity, and utilize the waste heat hot water boiler to recover the flue gas waste heat at the tail end of the units. After running at full load, the project can consume 1,262.88*104Nm3 of pure gas per year, with an estimated annual power generation of 4800*104kWh, which will be used for the mine's self consumption through integration into the North China Power Grid, and 5.184*104GJ of residual heat per year, which will be supplied to the outside world for the heating of the buildings on the site. However, to be conservative, emission reductions will not be claimed for waste heat recovery.\r\nDuring the renewable 7-year crediting period(28-Oct-2022 to 27-Oct-2029, both days included), the total GHG emission reduction of the project can reach 1,748,817 tCO2e, with an average annual emission reduction of 249,831tCO2e."", 'project_state_province': 'Shanxi', 'project_country': 'China', 'project_latitude': 37.98, 'project_longitude': 113.53}","1","1","1","1","1","0.04","212","-"

CGM Ceramic VCS Project Description
babaçu coconut husk which may be replaced by elephant grass and municipal
garden's residues, for thermal energy generation. This fuel exchange could
only be feasible when considering the carbon credits incomes, since the
adaptation of kilns to the new biomasses and the purchase of new
equipments required considerable investments.
The main goal of this project activity is to minimize the negative impacts
of the deforestation of the Caatinga biome by discouraging the
exploitation of the area through limiting the interested parties in
acquiring the proper legal documents for the commercialization of the
native fire wood.

CGM Ceramic VCS Project Description
1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:
The use of native wood without sustainable management as fuel is a
prevalent practice among the ceramics industries in Brazil. Wood from
deforestation is delivered and utilized in the ceramic facilities and
this non renewable biomass is offered with low prices.
Although firewood from deforested areas used has been for many decades as
fuel in Brazil, it is impossible to define a start date on which this
kind of non-renewable biomass began to be applied. Firewood used to be
the most employed source of primary energy until the decade of 1970, when
the petroleum started to supply the majority of Brazilian´s energy
needs 10 . Moreover the Brazilian´s Energy and Mine Ministry has been
monitoring every energetic sectors of Brazil since 1970, and firewood
appears over the years monitored as a significant source of thermal
energy for ceramic sector11.
According to Seye (2003) 12 , in Brazil, the red ceramic devices are
produced through an inefficient and traditional process using wood
without forest management to generate thermal energy. In this industry
segment the use of wood represents about 98% of the total fuel employed
stimulating
Therefore, the employment of this fuel stimulates the increase in
Brazilian deforestation rates. The baseline identified for this project
activity is the employing of a total of 22,800 m3 of native wood per year
to provide thermal energy to the ceramics’ kilns.
The project activity focuses on the use of wood from sustainable forest
management plan areas, sawdust, Algaroba wood, residues form cashew tree
and babaçu coconut husk as renewable biomasses for energy supply. The
entrepreneur aims to use municipal garden's residues and elephant grass
in the future.
1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG
emission reductions and/or removal enhancements:
The emission reductions will be achieved by displacing the use of wood
from areas with no sustainable forest management to provide thermal
energy in the ceramic companies. Therefore, the emissions launched during
the combustion of wood were not compensated by the replanting. An
opposite scenario occurs with the renewable biomasses employed in this
project activity, which have carbon neutral cycle.
1.9 Project technologies, products, services and the
expected level of activity:
Currently Gomes de Matos Ceramic uses two Hoffman13 kilns and one Câmara14
kiln constitutes the production line of CGM Ceramic.
The process for reducing water content in the ceramic devices is realized
with the employment of two dryer plants that utilize the heat originated

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
This is a green-field project developed to provide steam to steam customers described earlier.
This implemented utilising rice husk from internal sources, i.e., rice milling
operations of Yihai Kerry (Baicheng) Oils, Grains and Foodstuffs Industries Co., Ltd., who will
utilise the steam from this project. Prior to the project, the steam requirement did not exist for the
steam customers because those facilities started concurrently with project and hence the project
does not displace any existing steam generation project. Hence, there was no generation of rice
husk that is used in the project.
The excess rice husk available in the region is subjected to unplanned disposal including
dumping and/or burning in an uncontrolled manner. As per current practice in the region, rice
husk from different plants in the area are normally dumped in an unplanned manner and/or burnt.
Some of the rice husk decays and the rest are taken away by local villagers for various domestic
uses such as poultry feed, etc. The project, therefore, does not create any GHG emissions for
subsequent removal.
1.11 Compliance with Laws, Statutes and Other Regulatory Frameworks
The project is in compliance with existing local regulation6 encouraging implementation of rice
husk based thermal energy production. The local environmental regulations provide requirements
for pollution control from the project. The PP has assessed if there are any significant
environmental impacts due to the project and concluded there are not any such impacts. An
environmental impact assessment study report has been approved by the local pollution control
authority. The has provided for various inspections required for the project
equipment as per the local regulations.
1.12 Ownership and Other Programs
1.12.1 Right of Use
In respect of the GHG emissions that will be reduced by operation of the project described in this

 Project Description 2.1
2.1.1  Implementation Description 
The International Small Group and Tree Planting Program (TIST) is a combined reforestation and 
sustainable development project carried out by subsistence farmers in Kenya. The farmers plant trees on 
their land and retain ownership of the trees and their products. They receive training from TIST and a 
share of the carbon revenues from CAAC.  
TIST empowers Small Groups of 6 to 12 subsistence farmers in India, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda to 
combat the devastating effects of deforestation, poverty and drought. Combining sustainable 
development with carbon sequestration, TIST already supports the reforestation and biodiversity efforts of 
over 91,000 subsistence farmers. Carbon credit sales generate participant income and provide project 
funding to address agricultural, HIV/AIDS, nutritional and fuel challenges. As TIST expands to more 
groups and more areas, it ensures more trees, more biodiversity, more climate change benefit and more 
income for more people. The carbon credits create a new ‘virtual’ cash crop for the participants, who gain 
all the direct benefits of growing trees and also receive quarterly cash stipends based on the GHG 
benefits created by their efforts. The maturing trees and Conservation Farming will provide additional 
sustainable benefits that far exceed the carbon payments. These include improved crop yield, improved 
environment, and marketable commodities such as fruits, nuts, and honey.  
TIST provides an administrative backbone that supplies training in building nurseries, tree planting, 
Conservation Farming, building fuel-efficient stoves and malaria and HIV/AIDS prevention. Part of the 
backbone is a two-way communications network that includes newsletters, weekly meetings at the Small 
Group level, monthly meetings where groups of Small Groups receive training, periodic seminars at the 
national level and an award-winning monitoring system based on hand-held computers and GPS. TIST is 
available to everyone and all are considered equal. The rotating leadership and the Small Group rules 
empower women and the undereducated. Those who are the most successful, regardless of education 
levels or gender, become mentors and leaders. This project seeks to maximize environmental and social 
impact while supporting and improving existing agricultural activities. Planting trees on privately owned 
farms in conjunction with agricultural activities is minimally disruptive, resulting in virtually no leakage or 
baseline emissions. The project will continue to monitor the potential for leakage in the regular 
implementation of baseline surveys which assess the presence of displacement and other activities that 
could result in leakage. TIST representatives will regularly conduct site visits to farms to monitor farmers’ 
activities. Further discussion of leakage management can be found in section 3.2.3. Similarly, TIST will 
assess non-permanence factors through regular site visits. By aiming to visit farms once every 18 months 
the project will collect substantial amounts of data to make assessments of any losses and corresponding 
risk factors.  
This monitoring report is for a subset of the TIST project in Kenya and applies to 1,567 Small Groups, 
10,007 farmers, 6,321 project areas and 2,293.154 ha. The main species planted are Gravellia, Cyprus, 
and Acacia. TIST farmers use a mosaic restoration approach, planting on thousands of individual farms 
spread across the landscape.  
 
TIST estimates this project will result in as annual average GHG removal of 98,967 tCO2 and a total GHG 
removal of 5,937,992 tCO2.

2 GENERAL
2.1 Project Goals, Design and Long-Term Viability
2.1.1 Summarized Project Description (G1.2)
The Jari/Pará REDD+ Project is a partnership between Biofílica Investimentos Ambientais S.A.
and Jari Celulose, belonging to the Grupo Jari, with the purpose of promoting forest conservation and
reducing potential greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) based on a model of local economic development
that values the “standing forest” through the integration of Multiple Use Forest Management (timber and
non-timber) and the commercialization of environmental services.
The Project is located in the municipality of Almeirim, in the State of Pará, and borders the State
of Amapá to the North. There is a very important role in this region as it serves as a home for many rural
families and as an ecological corridor, with several Conservation Units (CUs) in its vicinity. There are
several communities directly or indirectly influenced by the Project, either because they are
geographically within the Project Area or because they provide manpower, some of them being: Nova
Vida, Braço, Cafezal, Recreio & Serra Grande.
It has a very rich biodiversity, its vegetation includes ten forest and non-forest formations, the
most representative is the Dense Ombrophylous Forest, which has several variations according to its
location on the ground. In addiction to species of extreme ecological importance (27 species of flora and
fauna have some degree of threat according to the IUCN Red List) and social (extractive communities
have diverse flora as a source of income and food). The main rivers are the Tueré River, the Jari River
(state border Pará/Amapá), the Paru River and the Amazon River (to the south).
Based on the studies developed, it is noted that the main agents that threaten the integrity of the
Project region are squatters and small farmers through agriculture and livestock activities and major
infrastructure works. Therefore, the components of this Project have been developed and aligned to
minimize and avoid deforestation, as well as to promote benefits for the climate, communities and
biodiversity.

1.13 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
The project is a Greenfield wind power project and does not involve generation of GHG
emissions for the purpose of their subsequent reduction, removal or destruction. Thus prior
to project initiation, there was nothing at site. In absence of project activity, the continuation
of current practice i.e. generation of equivalent amount electricity would have been
generated from grid connected fossil fuel dominated power plants. Thus for project activity
baseline scenario is electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have
otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the
addition of new generation sources.

VCS Project Description Template
In the year 2004, at the time the project decided to invest in the EFB fuel-fired power
plant, there was no biomass power plant using palm residues as main fuel and
supplying electricity to the grid in operation. Apart from Saraff Energies Limited
Power plant, another EFB related project was under construction. This project has
been implemented by Surat Thani Green Energy Co., Ltd. in Surat Thani Province
and is a registered CDM project10. According to the data available from the Energy
Policy & Planning Office, Ministry of Energy, Thailand, EPPO website11, two other
projects were under negotiation but have not been operating.
Therefore it can be concluded that the technology similar to proposed project is not a
common practice in Thailand. This clearly demonstrates that the project activity faces
significant barriers and that in similar circumstances the barriers actually prevent the
implementation of other projects.
Conclusion:
As explained in this section, the Saraff Energy EFB to electricity project faces strong
barriers and is not a common practice, and hence is clearly additional.
3 Monitoring:
3.1 Title and reference of the VCS methodology (which includes the
monitoring requirements) applied to the project activity and explanation of
methodology choices:
The CDM small-scale baseline and monitoring methodology AMS.I.D “Grid
connected renewable electricity generation” version 14 is applicable to the project
activity.
The methodology refers to the following tool:
• Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system, version 1.1,
dated 29 July 2008.
Both methodology and tool can be found on the UNFCCC’s website at the following
address: http://cdm.unfccc.int/methodologies/SSCmethodologies/approved.html
The project activity is a small scale activity as the boiler installed under the project
activity produces a maximum electricity output of 9.5 MW below the 15 MW
threshold. Therefore, the proposed project activity is eligible under the simplified
modalities and procedures for small-scale clean development mechanism project
activity.

Without the implementation of this project, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\r\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%1 .

Environmental Benefits
Through the generation and supply of renewable electricity to the grid the project activity has a direct
environmental benefit. The combustion of renewable biomass residues has long term benefits related to
climate change given that the alternative is a fossil fuel based generation system. Local pollution will
also be reduced through the combustion of biomass residues relative to the alternative fossil fuels for the
supply of electricity, especially in relation to NO , SO and ash which arise in coal based generation (ash x x
content of bagasse is of the order of 2% whilst Indian coal typically has an ash content of greater than
35%2).

1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
This is a Greenfield project. The project activity replaces the carbon intensive grid electricity. The
proposed project activity effectively utilises renewable solar energy to generate electricity which
will be feed into the coal intensive NEWNE Grid. Thereby the project activity reduces the
dependence on fossil fuel based generation units and as there are no associated emissions with
this project it contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions.

Figure 1. Agriculture expansion around project area
Thus, conservation actions are essential in the region, establishing a barrier against the
advancement of deforestation, making an important contribution to the Cerrado biodiversity
conservation and to climate regulation in Brazil and South America.
The revenue from the sales of the Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) is essential for the project
activity to compete with profitable alternative land use scenarios. In addition, the carbon credit
revenue is important to mitigate encroachment and illegal actions within and around the
Project Area. This surveillance allows the management of the environmental situation of the
property during the development of the forest exploration work, in addition to ensuring
compliance with the requirements set out in the current legislation.
To conserve biodiversity, avoid unplanned deforestation and reduce GHG emissions, the project
will implement activities that will allow the forest to remain standing. These activities include
increasing monitoring of areas, surveillance frequent patrols, increase actions against activities
such as encroachment attempts and fire outbreaks on the project area and surroundings.
Environmental education and other social activities that benefit the local community will be
supported, as well as improving the control of deforestation. The SOCIALCARBON® Standard is
being applied to assess and monitor the project's contribution to sustainability using six key
indicators: Biodiversity; Nature; Financial; Human; Social and Carbon Resources, thus
improving the social and environmental conditions in the project region10. All SOCIALCARBON
indicators will be monitored in the Buritirana Grouped REDD+ Project. The SOCIALCARBON
standard will be a complementary standard to the VCS standard. Thus, there will be no double
counting and a project ID will not be generated in SOCIALCARBON.
1.12 Project Location
The Buritirana Grouped REDD+ Project is located a region called MATOPIBA (acronym formed
with the initials of the states of Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí and Bahia, states in the north and
northeast of Brazil), known for its agriculture vocation, mainly focused in grains and cotton.

2.1.10 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
According to Appendix 1 (Eligible AFOLU Project Categories) of VCS Standard version 4.4, eligible
ALM activities are those that reduce net GHG emissions on croplands and grasslands by
increasing carbon stocks in soils and woody biomass and/or decreasing CO , N O and/or CH 2 2 4
emissions from soils; eligible ALM activities include Improved Cropland Management (ICM),
Improved Grassland Management (IGM) and Cropland and Grassland Land-use Conversions
(CGLC).
The project restores degraded grassland by planting grass and sustainable management of grazing
activities, thus increasing soil carbon stocks. The sectoral scope applicable to the project is VCS
scope 14 “Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)”; its AFOLU project category is
Agricultural Land Management, and its activity type is Improved Grassland Management.
The project is not a grouped project.
2.1.11 Project Activities and Theory of Change (G1.8)
GHG emission reduction or removal activities
Total of 332,660 ha of degraded grassland has been managed scientifically by grazing prohibition
and grass planting of local high-quality forage. And that reduces net GHG emissions by increasing
carbon stocks, and/or reducing non-CO GHG emissions. 2
There are two main restoration measures in the project: 1) Grazing is prohibited on severely
degraded grasslands to protect the natural grassland resource. This project sustainably manages
325,293.3 ha of severely degraded grasslands. 2) Fencing and planting of native grass species on
the moderately degraded grassland, grazing will be prohibited after the completion of grass planting
and fence installation. The grass species are Poa crymophila, Elymus nutans, Elymus sibiricus L.,
and Agropyron cristatum. There are 7,366.7 ha of moderately degraded grassland in this project
has been sustainably managed through artificial grass planting and fencing.
Through scientific and sustainable management of grazing, relevant training about technical skills,
scientific and effective management plan, alleviate soil desertification and restore grassland
vegetation to improve soil carbon storage and local biodiversity and enhance the capabilities of
local communities and residents.
These sustainable grazing management approaches will be conducted in conjunction with frequent
grassland patrolling carried out by grassland guardians in charge of ensuring compliance of
grazing activities with the project design. And the procedures for selecting high-quality grass seeds
must be followed, and seed quality must conform to the national standard Quality Grading of the
Grass Seeds (GB/6142-2008).

compliance with Energy Efficiency Law  (Article 2 of Part One). Environment Law is also satisfied in 
terms of sustainable development principl es and EIA conducted for the proposed project activity. Finally, 
Forest Law which specifies that forest areas can be allocated by Ministry of Environment and Forestry to 
institutions or individuals for energy plants if the project implementation serves com mon good for public .  
 
 
Outcome of Step 1b  
 
It has been demonstrated that proposed project is in compliance with the laws. Also, existence of thermal 
power plants serves as an evidence for demonstrating that alternatives are not prevented by laws or 
regula tions.  
 
Based on the above analysis, the proposed project activity is not the only alternative amongst the project 
participants that is in compliance with mandatory regulations.  Therefore, the proposed VER project 
activity is considered as additional.

The biogas power plant is owned by Liziz Biogas Sdn Bhd as a subsidiary of Mestron Holdings Berhad, with technical guidance from True Eco Sdn Bhd and carbon strategy provided by CarbonTrace Sdn Bhd. The purpose of the Project is to recover biogas produced during the POME treatment process, which, if not recovered, would be released into the atmosphere, thereby contributing to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The biogas power plant utilizes POME from Liziz Plantation Sdn. Bhd.'s palm oil mill as its feedstock. The proposed project activity includes the installation of an anaerobic wastewater treatment facility that employs Complete Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) biogas reactor technology. The biogas recovered is expected to be used for:  a. electricity generation for own consumption, and b. electricity generation to the national grid, with the option of flaring for any excess quantity generated. GHG emission reductions are achieved by capturing biogas from POME treatment, which prevents its release into the atmosphere and substitutes grid electricity with renewable energy. Prior to the project's implementation, the baseline POME treatment method would involve a series of cascading open lagoon ponds, and electricity needs were met through conventional means, which involved consuming non-renewable energy sources or energy from the national grid, primarily dependent on fossil fuels.

project start date was 28-March-20202 when the land preparation was started.
1.9 Project Crediting Period
The crediting period of this project will be using a 7-year, twice renewable crediting period, for a
combined total project crediting 21 years from 28-March-2020 to 27-March-2041, and the first
7-year period is from 28-March-2020 to 27-March-2027. Also, the project lifetime3 is 30 years
from 20-March-2020 to 19-March-2050.
1.10 Project Scale and Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals
The estimated annual GHG emission reductions/removals of the project are:
☐ <20,000 tCO e/year 2
☒ 20,000 – 100,000 tCO e/year 2
☐ 100,001 – 1,000,000 tCO e/year 2
☐ >1,000,000 tCO e/year 2
2 The earliest start date of rice cropping season among farmers which are recorded in the Farmers’ database.
3 The project lifetime is based on the design life of the ditches. The design lifetime of the ditches in this project is 30 years, so
the project lifetime is 30 years. The project's lifetime starts from the date the ditches are completed, so the start date of the
project lifetime is earlier than the project's start date.

VCS Project Description Template
1.10 Compliance with relevant local laws and regulations related
to the project:
The project activity is in compliance with all mandatory applicable legal and regulatory
requirements as shown below:
The implementation of the project activity is a voluntary initiative and it is not
mandatory or a legal requirement.
The Indian Electricity Act, 2003 does not restrict or empower any authority to
restrict the fuel choice for power generation.
The applicable environmental regulations do not restrict the use of wind energy for
power generation.
There is no legal requirement on the choice of a particular technology for power
generation in India.
Clearance from MP Urja Vikas Nigam the authorized body for renewable project
implementation has been received.

project’s GHG emission reductions or removal enhancements:
The project developer has taken higher investment risks compared to the alternatives,
which are demonstrated below:
Critical component failures (e.g. gear train/ box, bearings, blades etc).
Wind resource variability.
The proponents have to remain dependent on the O&M agency for all issues regarding
operations. This factor, coupled with low CUF values being experienced as compared
with fossil fuel based power plant, provided a constraint to the proponents for
going ahead with the project activity.
1.12 Demonstration to confirm that the project was not implemented
to create GHG emissions primarily for the purpose of its
subsequent removal or destruction.
The primary purpose of the project activity is to generate electricity using
renewable wind energy and export the generated electricity to the grid. Hence, the
project activity will reduce the GHG emissions.
1.13 Demonstration that the project has not created another form
of environmental credit (for example renewable energy
certificates).
Ruchi Soya Industries Limited has declared that no other environmental credit has
been created from the project activity. It is also declared that the same project
activity is also under CDM validation and on registering the project activity
with UNFCCC as CDM project the project activity will be withdrawn from VCS.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
VCS Version 3, CCB Standards Third Edition
1.7 PROJECT CREDITING PERIOD
Project crediting period is 30 years from 26 June 2013 to the 25 June 2043.
1.7.1 PROJECT CREDITING PERIOD AND CHRONOLOGICAL PLAN
The project will have 2 main phases:
• Phase I (1-7 years), to undertake most of the governance oriented activities, complete business plans, set
SPVs for productive activities, and provide technical assistance to farmers. During this phase, the
indigenous councils will work on their land use plans, capacity building, set-up of patrolling bodies,
conservation areas demarcation, and internal agreements for benefit distribution. Also, it will be used to
allow for implementation of productive activities, revenue sharing, and re-investment agreements. This
phase will consolidate the REDD+ project activities with the community, and will help build capacity for
MRV.
• Phase 2 (8-30 years), to continue with the implementation of the project activities. Years 11 and 21 will be
used to re-assess the baseline situation regarding carbon, deforestation and degradation drivers, and
project activities, and to define needs for readjustment. Land use plans and progress will be assessed and
discussed at the assembly level.

2.1 SECTORAL SCOPE AND PROJECT TYPE
This project is an Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) project under the Reducing Emissions from
Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) project category, sectoral scope 14. Specifically, the project is of the
v3.0 55

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
VCS Version 3, CCB Standards Third Edition
“Avoided Unplanned Deforestation & Degradation” (AUDD) project category. The project will not pursue IFM nor
ANR activities in any of the project areas. Some of the project activities do occur on wetlands; however the specific
carbon pools and GHG sources have not been accounted for as their exclusion leads to conservative estimates of
the total GHG emission reductions. The methodology VM0006 establishes that both below ground biomass and
soil organic carbon are optional carbon pools and may be conservatively excluded.
2.1.1 GROUPED PROJECT
This project is not a grouped project; nor will the project use the programmatic approach. All of the project area,
communities and activities, and associated risks, intended to be part of the project are included as part of the
current scale of the project.
2.1.2 PROJECT ELIGIBILITY
The project meets all of the requirements set forth in the VCS Standard v3.4, issued October 8th 2013, and the VCS
AFOLU Requirements v3.4, issued October 8th 2013.
The project further complies with all of the rules and requirements of the Climate, Community and Biodiversity
Standard (CCBS), Third Edition, December 2013.
The project also complies with all relevant legislation as specified in Section 3.
2.1.3 METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS
The project is using VCS-approved methodology VM0006, “Methodology for Carbon Accounting for Mosaic and
Landscape-scale REDD Projects v2.1” for quantification of GHG emission reductions and removals generated in
mosaic and landscape scale REDD+ projects.
The project applies the methodology VM0006 in full (See Section 4). It further uses the VT0005 Tool for measuring
aboveground live forest biomass using remote sensing, designed by Terra Global Capital. The tool provides a
method for determining Aboveground Live Forest Biomass (ALFB) through a combination of remote sensing data
and field measurements to provide an accurate and cost effective estimation of ALFB across varied LULC
classification types and broad spatial extents. The tool is intended for use with all approved VCS methodologies
within the scope of Agriculture, Forestry, and Land Use.
This methodology also refers to the latest versions of the following approved tools and modules:
• CDM A/R Methodological Tool Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks in dead wood and
litter in A/R CDM project activities.
• CDM A/R Methodological Tool 03 Calculation of the number of sample plots for measurements within A/R
CDM project activities.
• CDM A/R Methodological Tool 06 Procedure to determine when accounting of the soil organic carbon
pool may be conservatively neglected.
• CDM A/R Methodological Tool 09 Estimation of GHG emissions related to displacement of grazing
activities in A/R CDM project activity.
• CDM Tool for testing significance of GHG emissions in A/R CDM project activities.

1.13 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
Before the start of the project, the economic development of the project area was not good, and
the education level of local farmers was relatively low, so farmers lacked advanced irrigation
technologies like intermittent flooded water regime. However, intermittent flooded water regime
requires that irrigation and drainage can be controlled according to the growth needs of rice
during its cultivation. Whereas in fact, the low economic level leads to the low income of farmers,
which means that farmers have no additional economic capacity to afford the construction of
cement ditches which can practice controllable irrigation and drainage. So, the project has not

Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the backward continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and less methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\r\nThe implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir construction and necessary training for the farmers to help them conduct the intermittent flooded water regime during rice cultivation, which replaces the traditional continuously flooded method. Controllable irrigation and drainage according to the needs of rice growth can not only save water resources, but also reduce methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions (flooded state) In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%. Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 2.79 tCO2e/ha for rice is expected.\r\nThe implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 368,697 tCO2e in the first seven-year period, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 52,671 tCO2e.\r\nThis project aims to:\r\n- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes.\r\n- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers.\r\n- Provide more job opportunities, especially female workers.\r\n- Use a proportion of benefits to improve the local children’s education.', 'project_state_province': 'Chongqing', 'project_country': 'China', 'project_latitude': 29.44, 'project_longitude': 105.53}","5","3","5","5","3","0.16","256","-"

Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.0
The total AC capacity of the project activity is 84.65 MW and the power produced displaces an
equivalent amount of power from the grid, which is fed mainly by fossil fuel fired power plants.
Hence, it results in reduction of GHG emissions. The average annual GHG emission reductions
from the project activity will be 140,874 tonnes of CO e and total GHG emission reductions for 2
the chosen 10 year crediting period will be 1,408,740 tonnes of CO e 2 .
During this monitoring period, the actual emission reductions to be achieved are 68,935 tCO e. 2
In this process there is no consumption of any fossil fuel and hence the project does not lead to
any greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, electricity would be generated through sustainable means
without causing any negative impact on the environment. In the Pre- project scenario the
equivalent amount of electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity, would have otherwise
been generated by the operation of grid-connected fossil fuel based power plants and by the
addition of new generation sources.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
The project activity falls under consideration of the grouped project activity. The project activity
instances as part of the grouped project will have the following parameters
Sectoral Scope: 01 - Energy industries (renewable / non-renewable sources)
Project Type : I - Renewable Energy Projects
Project Category: Each project activity instances will apply only small scale solar technology.

Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.0
The project activity under consideration is a grouped project activity.
1.3 Project Eligibility
The project activity involves installation and generation of electricity using renewable energy
resources i.e. by using the solar energy (renewable sources) replacing electricity supply from a
fossil-fuel dominated electricity, thus leads to reductions of anthropogenic GHG emissions from
atmosphere. Hence the project activity is eligible Sectoral scope 1 i.e. energy industries
(renewable/ non-renewable sources) under the scope of the VCS Program.
The proposed grouped project activity involves 2 types of project activity instances.
1. Few project activity instances involved in the project activity are physically connected to grid,
but their primary purpose is to meet in house requirement and excess energy may be supplied
to grid (Net metering approach). If required, project activity instance import electricity from grid.
Since project activity meets eligibility criteria of having DOE contract before 09/03/2020 and
already submitted to VEERA in Dec 2019, all project activity instances currently considered
during VCS registration ( i.e 490 project activity instances) are eligible for VCS and not
categorised as excluded scope as per VCS Standard Version 4.0. However future grid
connected project activity instances will not be eligible to include under proposed grouped
project activity. This is as per Appendix 2 of VCS standard Version 4.0, point 2) Grouped
projects registered under the VCS Program shall be prohibited from adding new project activity
instances of the newly excluded project types on or after 1 January 2020.
2. Few other project activity instances are used for captive/in house consumption only and not
connected to grid. This is to be considered a micro-grid activity, and therefore such project
activity instances can be in future within the scope of the VCS Program
Also, project proponent would like to declare the followings (the declaration is also submitted
to the DOE):
• Each project activity instance is less than 15 MW and already included project activity
instances are located at more than 1 KM from each other. Hence there is no any
requirement of clustering of project activity instances for currently included project
activity instances
• In future inclusion, if any, the combined capacity of the project instances located at a
distances less than 1 KM will not increase 15 MW. Thus small scale methodology is
applicable for the proposed grouped project activity.
1.4 Project Design
The proposed project activity is a grouped project activity.
Eligibility Criteria
The project is a grouped project and following are the eligibility criteria for inclusion of new project
activity instances into the grouped project activity:

Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.1
1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project activity aims to replace the commonly used inefficient wood fired mud stove
technology, with efficient biogas based cook stove, which is clean and sustainable. The project
activity involves bundling household biogas plants located in the state of Telangana, India. The
proposed project activity includes 10,500 digesters of capacities 2m3 which were implemented
between 01st September, 2020 and 31st October, 2021.
Each household will utilize the dung of its cows to feed the digester for the production of biogas
for domestic purposes. The generated biogas from the plants to be used for the purpose of
cooking and other thermal energy needs in households. The thermal energy generated from the
project activity replaces the equal amount of thermal energy which otherwise would have been
supplied from the woody biomass (fire-wood) based stove technology. Therefore, the project
activity replaces firewood for equal thermal energy needs and thereby reduces harmful
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In addition, the hygienic conditions in the rural areas will
be improved by an appropriate disposal of waste. Further, residue from the bio digesters is used
as organic fertilizer and will improve soil conditions in rural areas.
Pre project Scenario:
Household survey was conducted to assess the baseline fuel and quantity used. As per the
Survey, firewood was the main fuel used to suffice domestic energy needs (cooking). It was
sourced from nearby forests and open market. Usage of firewood in inefficient cooking system
(conventional system) leads to indoor pollution and land use patterns have been showing a
decrease in forest land cover and increase in degraded land. A trend of forests turning into open
scrubs has been observed. Degradation of forest lands has exacerbated the already existing
problem of desertification. There is a need to maintain adequate forest cover in the state to
mitigate climate change effects.
Project Scenario:
The project activity involves construction and maintenance of 10,500 household biogas plants
located in the state of Telangana, India of capacities 2m3. The project development is performed
& maintained by Dhaneswri Mahila Sewa Sansthan Project activity involves installation of new
biogas plant in the households of Telangana and produced biogas will be used in the biogas
stoves for thermal energy needs. Hence, the project activity is a Greenfield project activity.
Residues from the bio digesters are used as organic fertilizer in the garden area and fields of the
local people.
Project activity will result in average saving of 51,409 tCO e/year. 2
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
Huaneng Daqing Heping Wind Farm Project (hereafter referred to as the project) is developed by
Daqing Lvyuan Wind Power Co., Ltd. The project is located at Middle Songnen Plain of Datong
District, Daqing City, Heilongjiang Province, People’s Republic of China. The project involves the
installation of 16 wind turbines, each of which has a rated output of 3,000 kW, providing a total
installed capacity of 48 MW. The annual output of the project to Northeast China Power Grid
(hereafter referred to as NEPG) is estimated to be 120,240 MWh after operation. Electricity
generated from clean renewable energy by the project activity will displace equivalent amount of
electricity generated from the fossil fuel-fired power plants of NEPG, and thus GHG (CO ) 2
generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation
sources of NEPG (which is dominated by fossil fuel-fired power plants) could be reduced. The
estimated annual GHG emission reductions of the project are 115,860 tCO e. 2
For the project:
- The scenario existing prior to the start of the implementation of the project is that electricity
delivered to NEPG by the project would have otherwise been generated by the operation of
grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources.
- The project scenario is that the implementation of the project, i.e. the installation and
operation of 16 sets of 3,000kW wind turbines with a total installed capacity of 48MW which
will supply an average annual electricity generation of 120,240 MWh to NEPG, replace the
equivalent amount of electricity generation by fossil fuel fired power plants connected into
NEPG and thus reduce the GHG emissions.
- The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation
of the project.
- The project will not only supply renewable electricity to grid, but also contribute to sustainable
development of the local community and the host country by means of:
- Accelerating the economy development of the local area and increasing the local revenue;
- Reducing the GHG emissions which are caused by the grid-connected fossil fuel-fired power
plants;
- Increasing the employment opportunities of the local area;
- Ameliorating the energy structure of the local area.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
The Project falls in the sectoral scope 1: energy industries (renewable-/non-renewable
sources).
Project type: Renewable (wind) power project
The Project is not a grouped project.

VCS Project Description
1.6 Duration of the project activity/crediting period:
The starting date of the project activity is 31st January 2004. (Based on the earliest
commissioning date of one of the Wind Millsin the group)
TheRenewable crediting period starts from 01/04/2006, which can be renewed once.
The starting date of credit period is considered from 1st April 2006. The chosen
crediting period is 10years(from 1stApril 2006 to 31stMarch2016).
1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:
Power generation, supply and demand scenario in India2:
A total of 123,014 MW capacity of Power Generation was installed in India till 2004-
05. In 2003-04, the demand for energy was increased by 2 percent which accounts to a
shortfall of 559 billion kWh, while peak demand rose to 84,574 MW. In the period
1992-93 to 2003-04, the energy demand for electricity increased at a CAGR
(compounded annual growth rate) of around 6 per cent, from 305 billion kWh to 559
billion kWh. During the same period, supply increased at a CAGR of around 6 per cent.
As a result, the energy shortage grew from 25 billion kWh (8.33 per cent) in 1992-93 to
40 billion kWh in 2003-04 (7.15 per cent).
As the figure shows, India has constantly been plagued with a demand supply gap in the
Power sector. Such a gap is a major hindrance to the growth of a developing economy
like India. The Government of India set up the Kohli Committee under Mr. Udesh
Kohli to estimate the investment required in the sector over the tenth and eleventh plans
to bridge this demand-supply gap.

2. The amount of fossil fuels co-fired does not exceed 80% of the total fuel fired on an energy basis.
3. The implementation of the project does not result in an increase in the processing capacity of raw input or other substantial changes in the production process.
4. The biomass used by the project facility is not stored for more than one year.
5. The biomass used by the project facility is not obtained from chemically processed biomass prior to combustion, and the preparation of biomass-derived fuel does not involve significant energy quantities.
6. In the case of fuel switch projects, the use or increase in the use of biomass compared to the baseline scenario is technically not possible without capital investment in retrofitting or replacing existing heat generators/boilers, installation of new heat generators/boilers, establishing a new dedicated biomass residues supply chain, or equipment for biomass preparation and feeding.
7. If biogas is used, specific conditions apply related to the generation of biogas through anaerobic digestion of wastewater.
8. If biomass is from dedicated plantations, specific conditions apply related to land use and establishment of the plantations.

2.3 Project Boundary
As per the methodology ACM0006, Version 12.1.1, the spatial extent of the project boundary
encompasses:
• The main components of the cogeneration plant, the bubbling fluidized bed boiler, the
turbo-alternator, the transformers;
• The 2 x 2 MW diesel generators used only as back-up during maintenance periods;
• All power plants which will be connected physically to the local electricity system (grid).
Currently there is no transmission line between Wageningen and Nieuw Nickerie, but its
development is planned to be completed for the operation of the facility. Therefore, the
electricity export can be absorbed by the regional grid (isolated from the national grid),
which will connect the isolated Wageningen and Nieuw Nickerie grids;
• The means of transportation of biomass residues to the project site;
• The auxiliary equipment and systems related to the generation of electric power and heat
at the project site.

The monitoring periods are set once every 5 years. The project starting in 2011, the first monitoring
period is 2016. That is why this PDD is a common report with first monitoring.
2.3.2 Geographic boundaries
According to the VM0007 methodology, the following zones have to be delimitated according to the
requirement of the module VMD0007 BL-UP:
 Two reference regions: (i) one for the calculation of the deforestation rate: RRD; and (ii)
one for the projection of the location of future deforestation: RRL;
 The project area (PA);
 The leakage belt (LB).
The delimitation of these zones is based on forest area. According to national REDD+ strategy of
Mozambique (MITADER, 2016), the national definition of forest (provided by the Mozambican
Designated National Authority i.e. MITADER) is: a minimum area of 1ha, a minimum cover of 30%
and a minimum height at maturity of 5m.
The different zones defined are presented in the following figure and rationales for their delimitation
are presented in the following sections. The figure presents global zones for their delimitation but
according to the definition of each zone, the exact areas are the forests comprised in those zones
(for PA and RRD). As required, the geodetic coordinates of the extent of each GIS layer is
presented in

Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.0
Social well-being focuses on the reflections of the project activity on the neighbouring community.
The project promoter envisages following social benefits:
 Improved standard of living
 Availability of infrastructure like electricity, roads, medical facilities etc.
 Reduce migration from rural to urban area for the sake of employment
 Awareness about the global issues, their solutions & role of India in the same
 Awareness among local people regarding wind power & its effect on rain and ground water level
So, it is responsible in bringing social well-being in the region.
Environmental Well-Being
The project activity is a clean source of power generation. The environmental aspects in consideration
are as follows:
 In comparison to other sources of power generation prevailing in the country, wind power is the
cleanest technology.
 As compared to other power plants, less amount of land is required for a single wind
turbogenerator.
 Wind power is renewable. It can be used continuously, whenever available. There is no danger of
depletion of the raw material used for power generation.
 Wind power is a naturally available source of energy. There is no processing required to make it
available for power generation.
Thus, wind power technology goes hand-in-hand with the environmental well-being of the region.
Technological Well-Being
The power generation technology used in this project activity is provided by M/s. Suzlon Energy Limited.
The technological well-being envisaged by the project promoter is as follows:
 It will boost the use of such technology by other project developers.
 Successful implementation and operation of this project will give necessary impetus in
implementation of similar technology in the region.
 The project activity will lead to transfer of environmentally safe and sound technologies that are
comparable to best practices in order to assist in upgradation of the technological base in the
local region
Economic well-being:
Economic well being refers to additional investment consistent with the needs of the local community.
The project in due course of time will draw additional investment to the region. In general, the project
activity envisages following economic benefits:
 Employment opportunities
 Market facilities for local products
 Industrial development
 Improvement of a rural economy
 Flow of goods and services
Although the realization of the above benefits would take a longer time needlessly, the economic
development of the region has been attributed to the project operation. The project contributes to the
sustainable development of the region during its entire operational life.

2 SAFEGUARDS
2.1 No Net Harm
According to Indian regulation, the implementation of the wind park does not require an environmental
impact assessment. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), Government of
India notification dated 14-September-20062 regarding the requirement of Environment Impact
Assessment (EIA) studies as per the Environment Protection Rule, 1986 (Published in the Gazette of
India, Extraordinary, Part-II, and Section 3, Sub-section (ii) MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT AND FORESTS)
states that any project developer in India needs to file an application to the Ministry of Environment,
Forest and Climate Change (including a public hearing and an EIA) in case the industry or project is listed
in a predefined list. Wind parks are not included in this list and thus an EIA is not required.
2.2 Local Stakeholder Consultation
The stakeholder meetings for the project were conducted at Suzlon’s Regional office at Jaisalmer
(Rajasthan) respectively on 24-March-2011 & 26-April-2011. The stakeholders were invited by Public
Notice dated 12-March-2011 & 12-April-2011 respectively. Personal invitations were also given to the
stake holders. The meeting were coordinated by Suzlon Energy Limited. Mr. Mohammad Abid, Mr.
Himanshu Kulkarni, Mr. Kishanlal Jakhar, Mr. Chetan Mehra & Mr. Surender Chaudhari represented
Suzlon in these meetings. The PP was represented by Mr. Nitin Jadhav. The stake holders were identified
based on the sustainability impact (direct & indirect) of this project activity on the life of the local people.
The project proponent & Suzlon welcomed the stakeholders for the meeting. The meeting was conducted
in Hindi. The representatives of Suzlon & PP explained the purpose of the meeting to the present
stakeholders and introduced all the stakeholders to all the representatives. He briefed the stakeholders
about the concept of Clean Development Mechanism, wind technology, climate change, effect of green

Mr. Mohammad Abid explained about the power-deficit scenario in India and the need of energy. He
explained importance of wind mills projects with respect to environmental well-being and its effect on
local economy. He informed stakeholders about project promoter’s keen interest in development of this
proposed project and its effect on sustainable development of the local area.
Some villagers gave comments (which are discussed below) on the wind farm and its effect on their life.
The stakeholder meeting ended with vote of thanks by Suzlon and PP.
Summary of the comments received:
The project proponent & Suzlon invited the stakeholders to offer their comments on the project.
The stakeholders present in the meeting gave a positive response; illustrating the different improvements
made in the village due to the project activity like medical facilities, availability of ambulance, oxygen
cylinders, civil work contracts to the local people etc. They further added that, different employment
opportunities, like security guards, drivers, have been created for local people. Jitendra Singh, a local
driver, said he is happy with the wind farm development in the local area as he has got job as a driver
and that helped him to live a stable life. He then queried if more projects like these can be brought in the
area. It was explained to the villagers that Suzlon has already commissioned many such projects in
Jaisalmer and will continue to do so. Mr. Singh also wanted to know if the electricity from these projects

1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
1.10.1 Historical conditions in the Lower Mississippi Valley
Bottomland hardwood forests and cypress swamps were historically the predominant forest cover types
along the major river floodplains in the Lower Mississippi Valley (LMV). The LMV, which occupies the
former floodplain of the Mississippi River from Cairo, Illinois to the mouth of the river in Louisiana,
historically supported one of the largest contiguous tracts of floodplain forest in the World. Over the past
century, these forests were cut and converted to agriculture on a massive scale and today only 26% of
their former extent remains9, much of it as isolated fragments. Most of the original forest cover in the
Lower Mississippi Valley was removed by logging between the late 1800’s and early 1900’s, facilitated by
development of the railroad and implementation of flood control measures10. Forests in the region were
cleared again in the 1960’s through the mid 1970’s in response to booming soybean markets and federal
subsidies for clearing11,12.
The historic bottomland forests of the LMV were diverse, with over 60 tree species; this forest type
continues to be one of the most productive in the U.S.13,14 Bottomland forests in the region also provided
habitat for a wealth of wildlife, including the Florida panther, Red Wolf, Louisiana Black Bear, and Ivory-
billed Woodpecker, species which are now rare or extirpated from the region.
The Lower Mississippi Valley Joint Venture Forest Resource Conservation Working Group (2007,
referencing Tanner15, Conner16) present an overview of the natural distribution of bottomland hardwood
communities in the LMV in relation to hydrology. Sites subject to flooding can be characterized as well-

"What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?","Based on the information provided, the project sector mentioned in the context is Forestry and Land Use.","Kitambar  Ceramic - VCS Project Description  
 12This way, it can be concluded that non-renewable biomass has been used since 31 December 1989. 
The cashew tree pruning is considered renewable accordi ng to option II, as soon as it fits all the assumptions 
below: 
“The biomass is woody biomass and originates  from croplands and/or grasslands where: 
(a) The land area remains cropland and/or gr asslands or is reverted to forest; and 
(b) Sustainable management pr actices are undertaken on these land areas to ensure in particular that the level of 
carbon stocks on these land areas does not systematically  decrease over time (car bon stocks may temporarily 
decrease due to harvesting); and 
(c) Any national or regional forestry, agriculture a nd nature conservation regulations are complied with.” 
Residues from cashew trees fits  all the three options above since just re sidues from the cropla nds area ar e utilized, 
i.e. the area remains a cropland with the use of the biomass. Moreover, the areas where the cashew trees fallows 
sustainable management practi ces, according to is cultivation and harvest techniques, where the pruning of cashew 
trees is necessary in order to allow an appropriate form ation of the tree and maintaining favorable conditions for 
the next harvest period21. This way, in cashew cultivation must be cut undesirable branches of the cashew trees. 
Besides, Brazilian’s production presents the tendency of increasing so far, carried by the new technologies utilized 
and the higher national and inte rnational demand of cashew nuts22. This way, the Brazilian sources of residues 
from cashew trees will increase following the Brazilian produc tion, due the fact that cashew cultivation requests it. 
 
 
The elephant grass is considered renewa ble according to option III, as soon as  it fit all the assumptions below:   
“The biomass is non-woody biomass and originates  from croplands and/or grasslands where: 
(a) The land area remains cropland and/or gr asslands or is reverted to forest; and 
(b) Sustainable management pr actices are undertaken on these land areas to ensure in particular that the level of 
carbon stocks on these land areas does not systematically  decrease over time (car bon stocks may temporarily 
decrease due to harvesting); and 
(c) Any national or regional forestry, agriculture a nd nature conservation regulations are complied with. ” 
Currently, elephant grass has been acquiring national importa nce as biomass to generate thermal energy due to its 
high productiveness and easy adaptation in almost all climate and soil Brazilian conditions23. The elephant grass is 
cultivated in pasture or degraded areas, in which there is  no vegetation to be deforested. Therefore, this practice 
will not generate competing use of biomass and it will not deforest a vegetated area. 
 
The Algaroba wood  (Prosopis juliflora),  is considered renewable accordin g to option IV: “The biomass is a 
biomass residue and the use of that bi omass residue in the project activity does not involve a decrease of carbon 
pools, in particular dead wood, litter or soil organic carbon, on the land areas where the biomass residues are 
originating from”. 
The utilization of Prosopis juliflora is in according with option IV since it is considered a biomass residue due its 
competitive characteristics. A research made by EMBRAPA24, which encompass the States of Pernambuco  and 
Bahia , affirmed that Algaroba  is characterized as an invasive exotic plant due to its fast expansion, which causes 
many environmental impacts25. This source stated that there were several centers of Algaroba  operation 
highlighting the San Francisco  Basin, which is comprised for many  municipalities from the states of Bahia  and 
Pernambuco , including this project region. 
 
The forest residues (sawdust), suga r cane bagasse and coconut husk are agro-industries residues, so they are 
considered renewable according to option V of methodology definition of renewable biomass: “The biomass is the 
non-fossil fraction of an industrial or municipal waste”. As  mentioned in section 4.1, sugar cane bagasse, coconut 
husk and forest residues are common residues in the regi on generated. Bagasse is ge nerated by industries to 
produce alcohol. Each ton of sugar cane used for al cohol production generates around 140 Kg of sugar cane 
bagasse, which can be either compacted into briquettes or utilized in natural for thermal energy generation.26 The 
forest residues are resulted from wood manufacturing. Eventually, the coconut husk is widely generated due to the 
utilization of the coconut fruit for diverse finalities.

Prior to formal implementation of the project, rotational logging of Pitch pine was conducted
every 50 years in the project area.
The baseline scenario is the same as the conditions existing prior to the project initiation,
please refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario)
• The project area is located in Danfeng County, Shangluo City, Shanxi Province, China;
• The ecosystem type in the project area is forest ecosystem, which has been used as
plantation forests and does not involve peat forests or wetlands;
• The historical land types in the project area have been planted as plantation forests,
with local villagers planting Pitch pine on their land and commercially harvesting it when
it reaches the age of rotation for economic gain;
• The terrain of Danfeng County is dominated by mountains and hills, with less flat land.
The climate is characterized by the transition from cool subtropical zone to warm
temperate zone, and the area around the Python Ridge in the north is characterized by
warm temperate mountainous climate with large vertical differences. The rivers in the

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The Hydroelectric Project Mulatos II (hereafter, the project activity or project) is implemented by Energía
del Suroeste S.A. E.S.P (hereafter, the project proponent).
The project activity consists of a small hydroelectric plant that utilizes water from the Mulatos river,
located in the south-east region of the Department of Antioquia, Colombia (hereafter, the Host Country),
in the Municipality of Tarso.
Before the implementation of the project activity, no power plants were installed at the project site. The
energy that will be generated by the project is currently dispatched by other power plants that are
connected to the national grid, and that include fossil fuel power plants. Hence, the baseline scenario and
the scenario prior to project implementation are the same and the project will help to reduce thermal
power generation in the National Interconnected System (SIN1) by providing renewable energy to the grid.
The Mulatos II project is a run-of-river hydroelectric plant. The project requires the construction and
installation of a lateral intake, a spillway, a gate for sediment flushing, a desander, channel,
forebay/settling tank, high-pressure penstock, power-house and discharge channel. One pelton turbine
with vertical axis and 7.0 MW and one synchronous generator with 7.8 MVA2 will be installed in the plant.
For this VCS project activity, the installed capacity is defined by the total installed turbine nameplate
capacity of 7.270 MW3.
The electricity generated by the project is expected to be around 42.49 GWh per year4, which will be
delivered to the SIN. It will help to reduce thermal power generation in the SIN by providing renewable
energy to the grid. Thus, it will contribute to sustainability by increasing the share of renewable energy
and reducing GHG emissions. The expected average annual emission reductions are 18,529 tCO during 2
a renewable 10-years crediting period.
Moreover, the project activity will facilitate the achievement of electricity demand required for the social
and economic development of the country based on a renewable energy source. The project will
contribute to the region’s sustainable development in the following ways:
 The project will decrease emissions of sulphur oxides (SO ), nitrogen oxides (NO ), carbon x x
monoxide, particulate matter, other pollutants, as well as carbon dioxide associated with the
combustion of fossil fuels.
 The project will reduce the dependence on fossil fuels, which are non-renewable and limited in
supply.
 During construction, the project will provide employment opportunities. To the extent practical,
these jobs will be filled by local residents. Besides, employment will also be generated for
operation and maintenance activities

1.13 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
Prior to the project initiation, economic conditions in the project area are not very good and
the level of education is relatively low11, so farmers lacked advanced irrigation technologies,
such as the intermittent flooded water regime. However, intermittent flooded water regime
requires that irrigation and drainage can be controlled according to the growth needs of rice
during its cultivation. To improve the infrastructure conditions of agricultural production,
increase food production, and promote sustainable agriculture, the project was implemented.
Therefore, the project was not implemented to generate GHG emissions for the purpose of
their subsequent reduction, removal, or destruction.
Since the conditions existing prior to the project initiation is the same as baseline scenario,
please refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario) to see the detail information. Besides, this
project does not affect the environmental conditions, including climate, hydrology,

Without the implementation of this project, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\r\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%2 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 9.27 tCO2e/ha for double-cropping rice is expected.

expected to be as follows (FAS 2020):
I. REDD+ projects to qualify and register under the Governing Body (LSA Article 12);
II. Executing agents deliver documentation for project registration (ex: Management Plan);
III. Management Agency analyses documents and registration of the project, and
establishes the initial number of Environmental Services Units applicable to the land
area;
IV. Environmental Services Units are registered in the Registration System by the
Management Agency (LSA Art. 19);
V. Executing agents carry out the development of REDD+ projects and certify under
standards approved by the Governing Body.
To this extent, the Evergreen REDD+ is maintaining an ongoing conversation with SisREDD+,
SEMA and PPCD-AM in order to integrate as soon as possible with jurisdictional programs, and
for Carbonext to continue to be a leader in the domain of JNR REDD+.
1.12 Project Location
The Evergreen REDD+ Project (hereafter “the project”) is situated in Apuí municipality in the State
of Amazonas, in the Southern Amazon. The municipality is located around 1,000 km from
Manaus, Amazonas State capital. The Project Area belongs to Ituxi Administração e Participação
Ltda (represented by Ricardo Stoppe Junior), and Renan Vitoriano Boehm, and is covered 100%
by native vegetation, totaling 130,554.8 ha. The northern project boundary lies approximately
20 km from the city of Apuí, the western boundary is close to, or at points touching, the Aripuanã
River, and the eastern boundary is flanked by the unofficial local road, the Estrada da Coruja,
and is within some 20 km of the Acari river. The full contour coordinates of the project area are
available upon request.
The primary means of access to the project is via road, the main one is leaving southwards from
the city of Apuí, Amazonas State, on the Estrada da Coruja, in the State of Mato Grosso (MT). This
journey must be done by 4x4 and is only feasible during the dry season (from May to September).
The second option is by road and then by boat, taking the boat the Trans-Amazonian Highway
(BR-230) from Apuí towards Vila do Carmo, AM until reaching the Aripuanã River, and then
southwards by boat for 100km, at which point the river meets the project’s Southwest corner.
However, this river has several waterfalls, making it difficult to reach the area during the dry
season.
In accordance with VCS requirements, stipulated in Approved VCS Methodology VM0007, version
1.6, the project area may only include areas composed of “forest” for a minimum of ten years
prior to the project start date. Therefore, satellite images between 2010 and 2019, were analyzed
and classified. The areas within the property that were defined as forest in 2010 and that
remained so in 2019 were used to define the project area. Through this methodology, 121.098
hectares were excluded from the PA.

Evergreen’s Project Area sums to 130,554.81 hectares of preserved forest area. Given the deforestation pressures and financial difficulties regarding sustainable economic activities in the Project Area, sale of the farm to private investors is considered the most plausible baseline scenario. In recent years, some of the project landowners have been approached to sell their properties. In this context, the conversion of a portion of the project area to pastureland by the project owners, to alleviate the financial pressure, followed by the regional business-as-usual scenario (BAU) is the most plausible future scenario, involving deforestation beyond Brazilian Forest Code limits and sale of illegal timber, followed by implementation of unsustainable cattle ranching operations.

"What are the methodologies of this project?","Based on the provided information, the methodology of the project can be summarized as follows:

1. Identification of Similar Projects: The project identifies similar projects that apply technologies different from the technology used in the proposed project activity.

2. Calculation of Factor F: The factor F is calculated to represent the share of similar projects using a measure/technology similar to the proposed project activity. The formula used is F = 1 - N/N, where N is the number of similar projects.

3. Evaluation of Common Practice: If the factor F is greater than 0.2 and N is greater than 3, the proposed project activity is considered a ""common practice"" within the sector and geographical area. Otherwise, it is not considered a ""common practice"".

4. Determination of Baseline Emissions: Baseline emissions are determined in two steps. Step A involves determining the methane eligible for crediting, and Step B involves determining the baseline emissions due to methane destruction, methane venting, and the use of other fossil fuels that are displaced by methane under the project activity.

5. Calculation of Baseline Emissions: Baseline emissions are calculated based on specific formulas and calculations, including emission factors and default values. The calculations are performed using an emission reduction and removal calculation spreadsheet.

6. Methane Destruction in Baseline: The baseline scenario does not involve any flaring or usage of coal mine methane (CMM), so the destruction of methane in the baseline scenario is considered to be zero.

7. Methane Venting in Baseline: The amount of methane that would have been emitted to the atmosphere in the baseline scenario is determined based on the difference between the methane production in the baseline scenario and the methane production in the proposed project activity, multiplied by the global warming potential (GWP) of methane.

It is important to note that this summary is based on the provided information and may not capture all the details and nuances of the methodology.","

Outcome of Step 4:
Based on the analysis above, the baseline scenario of the project is:
Combination of e, a and P1: Methane extraction: Combinations of methane extraction of prior to,
during and after the mining; Xiadian coal mine was equipped with CMM extraction facilities and all
extracted CMM was vented into the atmosphere directly; The electricity consumed at coal mine was

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
The government recognises the right and the benefit to this land belongs to the farmers and therefore
has the right to transfer benefits (such as credit carbon) to anyone. (see lawyer report for further
details)
A customary land owner can apply for a CCO as proof of ownership of the land. Any person, family or
community holding land under customary tenure on former public land may acquire a certificate of
customary ownership in respect of that land.
Throughout the project, PUR Projet plans to implement activities to sensitise farmers to land tenure
topics and help them to get their title through specific training and support.
Transfer of the emission rights
Every farmer participating in the program signs an agreement with one of the implementing partners
in charge of tree-planting activities of the project, setting the conditions of their participation in the
program, in which they agree to transfer all of their carbon credits rights to the partner.
The contractual relationship for the transfer of rights from the smallholder farmers is managed by the
implementing partner.
On the other hand, each implementing partner participating on the project signs a contract with PUR
Projet (project proponent), where they agree to transfer all carbon rights they have collected from the
smallholder farmers to PUR Projet.
1.7.2 Emissions Trading Programs and Other Binding Limits
The VCUs generated by the GHG emission removal of the project will be sold in the voluntary market,
to private or public entities who want to have a positive impact on climate on a voluntary basis.
The Project proponent itself nor its clients have any regulatory limits in Uganda on GHG emissions
and does not look for any compliance with any emissions trading program.
To date, there are no laws on carbon ownership rights and no emissions trading program in Uganda.
Ugandan NDCs include forestry activities but there is no decision yet on whether the government will
provide corresponding adjustment for private projects implemented on voluntary schemes.
1.8 Project Start Date
The start date of the project is 13/04/2016, the date on which the 2016 planting wave started.
1.9 Project Crediting Period
The crediting period is from 13/04/2016 to 12/04/2051. The length of the crediting period is 35 years.

"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology of this project involves monitoring the electricity generated by the renewable technology and the electricity imported and exported by the project activity. The monitoring methodology used for this project is specified in paragraph 13 of the approved small-scale methodology AMS I.D. The project-monitoring plan consists of metering the electricity generated by the renewable technology.

The data variables to be monitored include:
- Gross electricity generated by the project activity
- Electricity imported by the project activity
- Net electricity displaced by the project activity

The data variables are measured in MWh (megawatt-hours) and are continuously recorded. The proportion of data to be monitored is 100%. The data will be archived electronically.

The data variables are measured and calculated continuously, and the data will be archived electronically. The data will be kept for 2 years after the crediting period.

The methodology requires calculating the emission reductions based on the electricity displaced in the grid multiplied by the baseline emission factor. The baseline emission factor for the southern regional grid is in t CO2/MWh.

The project activity needs to measure the total electricity exported by the project activity in order to monitor the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The baseline for the project activity is formed by multiplying the electricity displaced in the grid by the baseline emission factor.

Overall, the chosen methodology is applicable to the small-scale project activity as it aligns with the approved small-scale methodology and suits the requirements of monitoring the electricity generation and emission reductions of the project activity.","

Reference of the approved monitoring methodology : Paragraph 13 of the approved small scale
methodology AMS I. D./Version 10 dated 23 December 2006.
D.2. Justification of the choice of the methodology and why it is applicable to the small-scale
project activity:
As discussed elsewhere in the document and established in Section A.4.2, the project activity is in
accordance with approved small scale methodology AMS I.D, and therefore, can use the monitoring
methodology for I.D of ‘Appendix B of the simplified M&P for small-scale CDM project activities-
Version 10: 23 December 2006’ – grid connected renewable electricity generation.
The monitoring methodology specified in paragraph 13 of the methodology requires that the project-
monitoring plan to consist of metering the electricity generated by the renewable technology. Emission
reductions of the project activity are due to the electricity displaced in the grid. The electricity displaced
in the grid multiplied by the baseline emission factor would give the emission reductions. Hence, the data
to be monitored to estimate emission reductions of the project activity is the electricity generated by the
project activity. Hence, the chosen methodology suits the project activity.
In order to monitor the mitigation of GHG due to the project activity, the total electricity exported by the
project activity needs to be measured. The electricity displaced in the grid by the project activity in MWh
multiplied by baseline emission factor for southern regional grid in t CO /MWh, would form the baseline 2
for the project activity.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
Brief Summary of the Project
The objective of the project activity is to set up a wind farm of aggregate capacity 50.4 MW in
India. The wind farms is in two different states of India, namely Rajasthan (38.4 MW) and Tamil
Nadu (12 MW). A total of 63 Wind Electric Generators (WEGs) of 800 kW capacities each is
installed at the sites, of these 48 WEGs is installed at Jaisalmer in Rajasthan and 15 WEGs is
installed at Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu. The project leads to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and
provide clean renewable power to the Indian Grid.
Scenario Existing Prior to Start of the Implementation of the Project Activity
The electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by
the operation of grid-connected fossil fuel dominated power plants (also the baseline scenario).
Project Scenario and the Technology employed
The project activity consists of 63 nos. of Enercon1 make 0.8 MW WEGs totaling to a capacity of
50.4 MW. The WEG generates 3-phase power at 400V, which is stepped up to 33 KV. These
WEGs are based on gearless technology, which helps in eliminating mechanical losses. It also
combines the variable speed with variable pitch and hence increases the conversion efficiency.
This technology is well established and running successfully at various sites in India
Contribution to reduction in GHG emissions by the project activity
With the implementation of the project activity, the electricity generated from wind turbines is
supplied to the Indian Grid which are dominated by fossil fuel based power plants thereby
reducing an equivalent amount of GHG emissions, associated with thermal energy generating
sources of the Indian Grid. The project thus helps in bridging the demand supply gap by using
wind as a source of generating electrical energy.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
Project Type: Renewable energy project
The project activity falls under Sectoral Scope 1: Energy industries (renewable - / non-
renewable sources

2 APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY
2.1 Title and Reference of Methodology
The emission reductions of the Project have been calculated in accordance with the approved large scale
CDM-methodology ACM0002 .: “Consolidated methodology for grid connected electricity generation from
renewable sources”, version 12.2.09. The methodology refers to the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for
an electricity system”, version.2.2.1 for baseline calculations. The tool offers two options of which the
Combined Margin (CM) approach has been chosen. The CM consists of the combination of operating margin
(OM) and build margin (BM) according to the procedures prescribed in the above-mentioned tool.
For the demonstration of additionality, “Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality”, version
6.0.06.0.0 has been implemented.
The methodology also refers to the following two tools:
• “Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality” which is only
applicable if the potential alternative scenarios to the proposed project activity available to project
participants cannot be implemented in parallel to the proposed project activity. Therefore, the tool is
not applicable to the proposed projects.
• “Tool to calculate project or leakage CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion” which is applicable
to geothermal and solar thermal projects, which also use fossil fuels for electricity generation for the
calculation of Fossil Fuel Combustion (PEFF,y), described in page 6/20 of the methodology. As the
projects are not geothermal or solar thermal projects, the tool is not applicable.

1.9 Project Crediting Period
The first crediting period under VCS is from 03/01/2011to02/01/2021(10years, renewable).
Therefore, the total crediting period under VCS would have been from 03/01/2011 to
02/01/2041 (30 years). However, the project was registered under CDM on 29/09/2011. And
thetotalcreditingperiod under CDMisfrom 29/09/2011to28/09/2032(21years).
As per VCS Standard version 4.2, para. 3.8.7, Projects registered under other GHG programs
are not eligible for VCU issuance beyond the end of the total project crediting period under
those programs. For example, a CDM project with a seven year twice renewable project
crediting period is not eligible for VCU issuance beyond the end of those 21 years. Where
projects havebeen registered under more than one other GHG program, they are not eligible for
VCU issuance after the date that is the earliest end date of all applicable project crediting
periods.
Therefore, according to VCS standard and considering the 22 years lifetime of the project
activity and 7*3 CDM renewable crediting period, the total VCS crediting period is 03/01/2011
to02/01/2032.
The project is applying for the second crediting period, which is from 03/01/2021 to

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
Zé Tunin project can be seen as a solution by the private sector to the Brazilian electricity sector
since it may help to avoid another electricity supply crisis, contributing to sustainable
development and having a positive effect for the country beyond the evident reductions in GHG.
Although Zé Tunin does not have a relevant positive impact in the host country given its electric
system size, it is without reasonable doubt part of a greater idea. The project contributes to
sustainable development since it meets the present needs without compromising the ability of
future generations to meet their own needs, as defined by the Brundtland Commission (1987). In
other words, the implementation of small hydroelectric power plants ensures renewable energy
generation, reduces the national electric system demand, avoids negative social and
environmental impact caused by the construction of large hydropower plants with large reservoirs
and fossil fuel thermo power plants, and drives regional economies, increasing quality of life in
local communities.
Therefore, indisputably the project has reduced negative environmental impacts and has
developed the regional economies, resulting, consequently, in better quality of life. In other words,
environmental sustainability combined with social and economic justice, undeniably contribute to
the host country’s sustainable development.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
Sectoral scope 1 - Energy (renewable/non-renewable).
The project consists of the construction of a single Small Hydro Power Plant, hence it does not
correspond to a grouped project.

Project Description: VCS Version 4.1
1.13 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
Prior to the project initiation, economic conditions in the project area are not very good and
the level of education is relatively low11, so farmers lacked advanced irrigation technologies,
such as the intermittent flooded water regime. However, intermittent flooded water regime
requires that irrigation and drainage can be controlled according to the growth needs of rice
during its cultivation. Whereas, the low economic level leads to the low income of farmers,
which means that farmers have no additional economic capacity to afford the construction
of cement ditches which can practice controllable irrigation and drainage. So, the project has
not been implemented to generate GHG emissions for the purpose of their subsequent
reduction, removal, or destruction.
Since the conditions existing prior to the project initiation is the same as baseline scenario,
please refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario) to see the detail information. Besides, this
project does not affect the environmental conditions, including climate, hydrology,
topography, soils, relevant historical conditions, type of vegetation, ecosystems, etc., so, the
present and prior environmental conditions of this project are the same, which are listed as
follows.
11 The ex-ante investigation report of Zengdu District in 2019 from Hubei Academy of Social
Sciences
13","{'project_name': 'Adjusted Water Management in Rice Cultivation In Zengdu District', 'project_summary': 'The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation is conducted in Zengdu District within Suizhou City, Hubei Province of China, with a total acreage of 13,336ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\r\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 4.42tCO2e/ha for single-cropping rice is expected. Annua average estimation of GHG emission reductions from the project activity is 58,979 tCO2e/year, and the total GHG emission reductions are 589,790 tCO2e during the fixed 10 years crediting period.\r\nThis project aims to:\r\n\uf0b7 Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;\r\n\uf0b7 Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;\r\n\uf0b7 Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers;\r\n\uf0b7 Increase in the number of individuals with improved capacity due to diversified educational opportunities from Trainings.', 'project_state_province': 'Hubei Province', 'project_country': 'China', 'project_latitude': 31.34, 'project_longitude': 113.25}","4","3","5","5","5","0.12","329","-"

SECTION B. Application of a baseline and monitoring methodology:
B.1. Title and reference of the approved baseline and monitoring methodology applied to the
project activity:
Baseline methodology:
ACM0002(Version 06): Consolidated baseline methodology for grid-connected electricity generation
from renewable sources.
“Tool for the Demonstration and Assessment of Additionality (version 05)”.
Monitoring methodology:
Approved consolidated monitoring methodology ACM0002 (Version 06): “Consolidated monitoring
methodology for zero-emissions grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources”.
More information about the methodology can be found on the website:
http://cdm.unfccc.int/methodologies/PAmethodologies/approved.html
B.2. Justification of the choice of the methodology and why it is applicable to the project
activity:
The proposed project can meet the applicability criteria of the baseline and monitoring methodology
(ACM0002), therefore, the methodology is applicable to the proposed project.
(cid:1) The proposed project is a grid-connected zero-emission renewable power generation activity
from wind source;
(cid:1) The proposed project is not an activity that involves switching from fossil fuels to renewable
energy at the proposed project site.
(cid:1) The power grid (the Northeast China Power Grid) which the proposed project is to be
connected to is clearly identified and information on the characteristics of this grid is publicly
available. (http://cdm.ccchina.gov.cn/WebSite/CDM/UpFile/File1364.pdf)
(cid:1) The additionality of the proposed project can be verified using “Tools for the demonstration
and assessment of additionality (version 05)” requested by the baseline methodology
(ACM0002 Version 06).
B.3. Description of how the sources and gases included in the project boundary:
According to the methodology ACM0002(Version 06), since the proposed project is a grid connected
wind power project, only CO2 emission from fossil fuels fired power plants in baseline scenario need to
be considered.","{'project_methodologies': ['ACM0002']}","4","3","5","5","5","0.02","333","-"
"What are the methodologies of this project?","Based on the provided context, the methodology of the project is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that there are no deviations from the methodology. The project involves the implementation of a commercial operation that supplies electricity to the grid. The baseline emissions are calculated based on the displacement of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants due to the project activity. The specific methodology used for calculating the baseline emissions is referred to as ACM0002 - Ver21.0.","

VCS Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report Template, v4.3
The above explanation/justification clearly shows that the proposed project activity is unlikely to
be financially attractive as well as not a common practice in the host country; hence the project
activity is additional.
3.6 Methodology Deviations
There is no methodology deviation
4 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
4.1 Implementation Status of the Project Activity
The current status of project implementation includes the following key points:
Operation during Monitoring Period:
The project commenced its commercial operation on November 11, 2022, and has been
consistently operational throughout the monitoring period. Monthly net electricity supplied to the
grid, crucial for emission reduction calculation, is extracted from the Joint Meter Reading (JMR)
reports. No significant issues affecting emission reductions or removals have been identified
during this period.
Changes to Project Proponent or Other Entities:
There have been no alterations to the project proponent or other essential entities associated
with the project. The original project proponent continues to lead and oversee the project's
implementation.
5 QUANTIFICATION OF ESTIMATED GHG
EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND
REMOVALS
5.1 Baseline Emissions
Baseline emissions include only CO emissions from electricity generation in fossil fuel fired 2
power plants that are displaced due to the project activity. The methodology ACM0002 – Ver21.0,
assumes that all project electricity generation above baseline levels would have been generated
by existing grid-connected power plants and the addition of new grid-connected power plants.
The baseline emissions are to be calculated as follows:

>>
18/08/2005(permission of construction)
Starting date of project activity (from 31 October 2004 for the construction start date to 18
August 2005 for the construction approval)
It was misunderstood to defined the start date as October 31, 2004 in the PDD for global stakeholder
comments. During the site visit, DOE interviewed local government and was able to verify that
the real project starting date should be the project construction permit date of 18 August 2005
according to DNV’s understanding on the start date at that time. So the choose of 18 August
2005 as the project starting date is conservative and reasonable. According to the new guidance
by EB on start date that shall mean the actual cost would occur, then the start date should be
further changed as 10th September 2005 (the earliest contract signed, i.e. turbines purchase
agreement signed).
So on the conservative manner, the earlier date of 18th August 2005 was selected as project
starting date. The change for the starting date has no impact for the additionality.

CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3
2.5.10 Management of Double Counting Risk (G5.9)
VCS+CCB credits are the only form of environmental or social credits being generated from this project.
No other environmental, climate, community or biodiversity credits will be generated or sold.
Also, the project area excludes any potential project generating any form of environmental or social credit.
2.5.11 Emissions Trading Programs and Other Binding Limits
Emissions reductions or removals as a result of this project will not be used for compliance under any other
trading program or mechanism. The current project is entirely independent of any other carbon project
scheme being developed in Brazil such as REDD programs existing in other states32; therefore, no double
counting will occur.
Additionally, law 12,651/2012 that refers to reforestation in PPAs and LR states clearly in Article 41 § 4º
that these areas are eligible to any form of payment or incentive of PES and are considered additional for
national and international markets for GHG emission removals and reductions.
2.5.12 Other Forms of Environmental Credit
The project has not sought or received any other GHG environmental credit.
2.5.13 Participation under Other GHG Programs
The project has not been registered, nor is it seeking to be registered under any other GHG program.
2.5.14 Projects Rejected by Other GHG Programs
The ReforesTerra grouped project was not submitted to Validation/Verification to any other GHG program
and therefore has not been rejected by any other GHG program.
2.5.15 Double Counting (G5.9)
Aside from VCS+CCB credits, the project does not seek to generate or receive any other form of
environmental or social credit, including any tradable climate, community, or biodiversity unit. Use of the
Verra Registry will ensure generation, transfer, retirement and cancellation of VCUs is tracked so that
unicity of credits is ensured.
32 Rondônia is the only Amazonian state that has not presented a proposal to the LEAF coalition. Even if
a LEAF-funded jurisdictional REDD+ program started in Rondônia in the future, Afforestation,
Reforestation and Revegetation projects would fall outside of the scope of REDD+ activities covered by
the TREES standard and funded by the LEAF Coalition. Therefore, there would be no risk of double
counting of credits from the ReforesTerra grouped project.

Project Description: VCS Version 4.2
1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The aim of the project is to facilitate the roll-out of conservation agriculture (CA) in regions of
South Africa where it is not prevalent. The intention is to at a minimum, assist farmers to replace
conventional cultivation practices with the three essential components of CA – no till, cultivating
a variety of species and the maintenance of organic cover through the year.
To facilitate the initial adoption as well as long-term maintenance of these essential components
and potential additional activities, a broad set of activities are required that are centred around
three goals:
• To address the lack of regionally specific awareness, knowledge, evidence and models.
• To build regional technical support programmes and peer networks based on trust and
evidence, and
• To create an attractive financial incentive package to sustain implementation over the
long-term.
In terms of a broad strategy, a bottom-up participatory approach will be followed working with
existing programmes, farmer study groups, farming organisations and institutions to increase
awareness and knowledge of the opportunity in an effective and efficient manner. In a similar
manner, regional expertise and research will be drawn upon to develop the supporting science,
monitoring methods and financial models. Such an approach not only improves the viability of
the underlying activities but creates the trust and buy-in required to sustain implementation over
the full project period.
This approach is based on the proven concept of farmer innovation platforms where the
engagements and interaction are farmer centred. Farmers are seen as the principal restoration
agents and practitioners. Their innovation, involvement and support are vital to ensure
fundamental change over the medium to long-term. We will therefore facilitate a process that
focuses upon the farmer to also create the maximum benefits to the farmer given their respective
climatic and geophysical contexts. Enhancing soil carbon is therefore not the sole aim of the
project, but also to ensure a fundamental change in farming practices that leads to the long-term
enhancement of soil health and the system-wide resilience of food, income and job security.
A grouped project approach will be taken where the intention is to add farms (project instances)
over time that meet all eligibility criteria. The initial set of identified farms are expected to lead to
GHG emission reduction and removals of approximately 106,000 tCO e per year or 3,180,000 2
tCO e over a 30-year project period. 2

"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology of this project is based on the approved CDM methodology AR-ACM0003 ""AR Large scale - Afforestation and reforestation of lands except wetlands"", version 2. Several CDM methodological tools are used in accordance with this methodology, including the ""Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality"", ""Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in A/R CDM project activities"", ""Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks in dead wood and litter in A/R CDM project activities"", ""Estimation of non-CO2 GHG emissions resulting from burning of biomass attributable to an A/R CDM project activity"", ""Tool for estimation of change in soil organic carbon stocks due to the implementation of A/R CDM project activities"", and ""Tool for demonstrating appropriateness of volume equations for estimation of aboveground tree biomass in A/R CDM project activities"".

The applicability conditions of the methodology AR-ACM0003 are that the land subject to the project activity does not fall in the wetland category and that soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10% of the area in land containing organic soils or land subjected to specific land-use and management practices.

The project boundary includes the areas of land where the project activity is conducted, which are former agricultural and pasture lands. Wetlands, degraded forests, and other protected sites are not included in the project boundary. Soil analysis confirms that plantations are not established on wetlands, and the project only involves soil disturbance during soil preparation before plantation, which affects a maximum of 10% of the area.

The project also utilizes other tools for estimating aboveground tree biomass and calculating the number of sample plots for measurements within the project activities. The project activity meets the applicability conditions of these tools.

Overall, the methodology and tools used in this project aim to ensure the accurate estimation of carbon stocks and changes in carbon stocks in different pools, as well as the appropriate management of soil organic carbon stocks.","

3 APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGY
3.1 Title and Reference of Methodology
Approved CDM methodology: AR-ACM0003 “AR Large scale - Afforestation and reforestation of
lands except wetlands”, version 2
These CDM methodological tools will be used in accordance with the methodology:
 “Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality”, version 01
 “Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in A/R CDM
project activities, version 4.2
 “Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks in dead wood and litter in A/R
CDM project activities, version 3.1”
 “Estimation of non-CO2 GHG emissions resulting from burning of biomass attributable to an
A/R CDM project activity”, version 4.0
 “Tool for estimation of change in soil organic carbon stocks due to the implementation of
A/R CDM project activities”, version 01.1.0
 Tool “Demonstrating appropriateness of volume equations for estimation of aboveground
tree biomass in A/R CDM project activities”, version 1.0.1
3.2 Applicability of Methodology
Applicability conditions of the methodology AR-ACM0003: Afforestation and reforestation of
lands except wetlands (Version 2) are:
(a) The land subject to the project activity does not fall in wetland category
San Pedro plantations are established on former agricultural and pasture lands. Wetlands,
degraded forests and other sites are protected as part of the FSC certification scheme.
According to the soil classification of the IPCC, all gleysols are considered wetland soils and
therefore the respective areas are treated commonly as wetlands.
According to internal SOP’s, plantations are not established on wetlands. Soil analysis of the
plantations, which were conducted by independent consultants confirm this procedure. The most
represented soil types on the FMU 9 are Rhodic Ferralsol and Rhodic Acrisols. The data of a
Rhodic Ferralsol, which occurs on 1,100 ha of the FMU 9 is shown in Table 11. Very common are
also Rhodic Acrisols in FMU 9 (700 ha). These soil types belong to the IPCC class of “Low activity
clay soils”. However, some FMUs, incorporate gleysols typical for wetlands. Whenever this is the
case, these areas are protected and not used for afforestation or any other purposes. This is
supported by baseline and project land use plans. The plantations are established only on former
agriculture or pasture land. Further, soil analysis results are available upon request.

Table 11. Sample data of a Rhodic Ferralsol soil type, data HWSD
Parameter Value
Dominant soil group Rhodic Ferralsol
Topsoil texture Fine
Drainage class Moderately Well
Topsoil sand fraction (%) 13
Topsoil silt fraction (%) 25
Topsoil clay fraction (%) 62
USDA Texture classification Clay (heavy)
Reference Bulk density (kg/dm3) 1.18
Topsoil gravel content (%) 0
Topsoil organic carbon (% weight) 1,2
Topsoil pH 5.3
Topsoil CEC (cmol/kg) 9
(b) Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10 per cent of
area in each of the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project
boundary:
(i) Land containing organic soils;
(ii) Land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and
receives inputs listed in appendices 1 and 2 to the methodology.
Soil disturbance in the project only happens during soil preparation before plantation. This
activity is conducted only in the lines where trees will be planted, with a width of maximum 50 cm
and up to 50 cm depth. The maximum density of plantations uses a spacing of 5 x 2 m, with a
separation of 5 meters between lines and 2 m between trees for pure plantations. In the case of
silvopastoral systems, trees are established in double rows of 5 x 2 m like pure plantations, and
then separated by a wider alleyway in between of 9 m. In the worst case scenario using the
spacing of 5 x 2 m, soil disturbance affects 10 % of the area considering:
 A line of trees every 5 m results in 20 lines/ha
 20 lines * 0,5 m of width * 100 m of length/ha = 1,000 m2 of soil disturbance/ha

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittently flooded conditions during rice
cultivation is conducted in the west of Tongren City, Guizhou Province, China, with a total acreage
of 18,892 ha for single-cropping rice. Without the project, which provides ditches to conduct
intermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously flooded method would be continued,
so the scenario that rice was cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline
scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded conditions can emit a large amount
of methane because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittently flooded method is more
beneficial to water conservation, production increase, and less methane emission reduction than
the continuously flooded.
The implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir
construction, pumps and valves installation, training, etc. According to the needs of rice growth,
farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water
resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic
conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice
paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in
the rainy season. In this case, the methane emission can be declined by an average of 48%.
Hence, with the proposed project activity, the estimated GHG reduction from rice is 3.13
tCO e/ha. 2
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to
413,980 tCO e in the first seven-year period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 2
59,140 tCO e. The project aims to reduce GHG and mitigate climate changes, increase the rice 2
productivity resulting in higher living standards of local farmers and provide more job
opportunities.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
This project is categorized as sectoral scope 14 (AFOLU) under Verra as justified in Section 1.3,

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
Godrej Industries Limited (Chemicals Division) has a modern, integrated manufacturing facility at
Valia in the Indian state of Gujarat1. This faculty uses vegetable oils as the raw material to
manufacture Fatty Acids, Glycerine, Fatty Alcohols & Surfactants such as Sodium Lauryl
Sulphate and Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulphate. The installed capacity for Fatty Alcohols is 65,000
MT per annum which includes a dedicated Export Oriented Unit of 30,000 MT. The facility is
ISO9001 and ISO14001 certified for manufacturing Fatty Acids, Fatty Alcohols and Glycerin. The
project participant - Godrej Industries Limited is referred further as GIL or PP further in this
document.
The chemical production plant at the site has a steam demand of 18 TPH. In pre-project scenario,
the stream demand was met by two natural gas (NG) based boilers – 12.7 TPH and 13 TPH
each. Under the present project activity, a new 12 TPH renewable biomass based boiler will
partly displace steam from existing NG based boilers. Both the existing boilers will be kept under
part operations and as standby even after implementation of the project activity.
The project will use renewable biomass briquette purchased in the market. As the biomass is
generated from agro processing industry, it is a renewable biomass as per definitions in ‘Glossary
of CDM Terms Ver 07.0’2.
At the time of project planning, GIL had option to choose a coal based boiler (an economically
attractive alternative as shown in the following sections) for meeting the captive steam demand.
However, considering the GHG emission reduction opportunity, the project proponent has chosen
a renewable energy based project.
Project Location: Village – Kanerao, Taluka – Valia, District – Bharuch, Gujarat, India
How project reduces emissions: The project uses renewable biomass residue and replaces use
of coal (in baseline, and pre-project natural gas fuel in part) that would have otherwise led to
equivalent CO emissions (please refer following Sections for details). 2
Pre-project scenario: The project is located at a chemical production plant. The chemical
production plant has a steam demand of 18 TPH. In pre-project scenario, the stream demand
was met by two natural gas (NG) based boilers – 12.7 TPH and 13 TPH each.
The project is expected to reduce average 13,888 tCO annually over the crediting period. 2

1.14 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
Before the project activity, Solid Waste was been dumped into landfill, unattended with
uncontrolled liberation of methane into the atmosphere. In addition, the quantity of electricity
produced using LFG and biogas would have been produced by power plants connected to

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The “Improved cropland management project in Gaotang” aims to raise farmer's awareness on
the benefits of sustainable agriculture and how to change the agricultural practices to help in
climate change mitigation and adaptation. The project will assist farmers to overcome barriers
that prevent adoption of improved agricultural land management practices and provide technical
assistance where needed. The objectives of the project is to reduce emissions from agricultural
practices and increase soil carbon storage, in order to achieve these, a package of practices that
change the pre-existing agricultural management activities will be carried out, the specific
activities are the following:
A. Reduce fertilizer (organic or inorganic) application;
B. Reduce tillage/improve residue management; and
C. Improve crop planting and harvesting.
The project is located in Gaotang County, Liaocheng City, Shandong Province, where is in the east
of China. The project activities includes reducing fertilizer application, no tillage and straw
returning to improve residue management. It also involves crop rotations of wheat and corn to
improve crop planting and harvesting. The project will cover 50,000 ha located in Gaotang County.
Prior to the start of the implementation of the project, there was no similar sequestration of
carbon, removals or net reduction of GHG activities. The baseline scenario is the continuation of
pre-project agricultural land management practices, which are common agricultural practices in
Shandong Province. The project will generate an estimated annual average removal and
reduction of 120,000 tCO e. Over the 20 years of the first crediting period, the project is expected 2
to reduce the GHG emissions by 2,400,000 tCO e in this period. 2
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type

"What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?","Based on the information provided, the project sector is Renewable Energy. The project involves the utilization of biomass residues, specifically rice husk, as a renewable source of energy to generate heat, thereby reducing reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions."," 
 
 14The proposed project activity will lead to generation of employment and 
development in the local region. More prominently employment is generated 
amongst the local contractors, laborers and others for biomass handling at the 
project site. This is in addition to the employment generated as a result of the 
operations and commissioning of the unit. Thus the implementation of the 
project activity is expected to contribute to the provision of basic amenities to the local region, which is relatively backward and under-developed. 
 Economic well being
 
 
The proposed project activity will lead to economic development in the region at 
the micro-level by facilitating alleviat ion of poverty amongst local people. At 
the macro-level, the project activity aids to sustainable development by 
substitution of fossil fuels by renewable biomass. This reduces the country’s 
reliance on fossil fuels, majority of which is imported and provides economic 
value to crop residues, which previously had no commercial value.  
  
Environmental well being  
 
The project activity will result in GHG emission reduction by utilising biomass 
residues as fuel and avoiding use of displacing fossil fuel. In addition to the reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions the project implementation will 
avoid the emission of other harmful gases (NOx and SOx) that arise from the 
combustion of coal used in heat generation. The project will also lead to reduced ash generation since the ash content in rice husk is lower than that of Indian 
coal.  
 
Technological well being
 
 
The proposed project activity under cons ideration uses greener technology, 
which promotes sustainable development. While the project showcases an innovative way for energy utilization of  biomass (rice husk) which are not 
normally used for heat generation purposes. The emphasis on using renewable 
biomass as the fuel firmly sets an example for implementing technological processes that help mitigate the green house gas emissions. The initiative is also 
in line with the global focus towards sustainable development.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The Lock Haven Improved Forest Management Project Area (“Project Area”) is a 4,905.59-acre parcel
situated in Clinton County, Pennsylvania. The Project Area has been put under a conservation easement,
in perpetuity, with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) with the intention of conserving the property and
managing its forest resources sustainably into the future. The Project Area has ecological, scientific,
educational and aesthetic value in its present state as a natural area that has not been subject to
development or severe resource exploitation.
The Project Area is comprised of primarily native forest types characteristic of the region. The forest
protects the West Kammerdiner Run and McElhattan Run, headwaters of the Susquehanna River and the
Chesapeake Bay. The Project Area contains significant stands of diverse mixed hardwoods as well as
oak hickory forest types and wetlands that provide habitat for a multitude of species and natural
communities.
In the 20 years preceding the project’s inception, the forest across the property have been largely
unmanaged. The tracts have been heavily influenced by fire, deer browse pressure, ice damage and
forest pests but these factors have led to different trajectories of forest development based on soils,
aspect and other ecological and management factors. Major portions of Lock Haven City Authority
(LHCA) properties have been high-graded. Overall, LHCA tracts can be characterized as fully stocked,
mid-successional dominated, dry hemlock/white pine and mixed oak stands that have degraded
understory conditions with moderate encroachment of undesirable competing plants that are negatively
impacting stand dynamics surrounding composition, structure, and regeneration.
The project will extend the rotation age of the timber resource on the property by approximately 45 years
compared to Common Practice, thereby reducing carbon emissions and increasing carbon sequestration.
The project activity will employ a sustainable level of harvesting, as specified in the FSC compliant
management plan required by the conservation easement, and will facilitate improvements in the overall
health of the forest. The project on average will generate 6,383 mtCO2e annually and 370,187 mtCO2e
total GHG emission reductions and removals.

Guzhang County, Dingcheng District, Jinshi County, Shimen County, Hanshou County,
Xiangyin County, Ziyang District, Heshan District, Yuanjiang county and Wangcheng
District. The geographical coordinates of the project area is 111°26′52.8126＂~112°
13′05.2497＂E, 29°00′33.6024＂~29°30′58.7772＂N. The project’s aim is to
increase carbon sequestration and contribute to local sustainable development by planting
trees on barren lands. The project proponent is Jilin Forest Industry Environmental
Technology Co., Ltd.
The project area is 41,317.962 ha., with some of the project land being state-owned and
managed and operated by forest farms, while the rest being collective-owned and used
by local villages. These land owners/operators have signed land leasing agreement with
Yiyang Senhua Forestry Development Co., Ltd. and the Yiyang Senhua Forestry
Development Co., Ltd has authorized Jilin Forest Industry Environmental Technology Co.,
Ltd. the right of forest management within the project boundary in the project’s life time.
All the trees are native species, including Chinese fir, Masson pine and Poplar.
Prior to the project activity, according to the baseline survey15, the project area has been
barren since 1989, causing substantial soil and water erosion, biodiversity loss, climate
change, and perpetuated low income and poor living condition in local communities. There
are mainly scatter shrub and grass land in the project area prior to the project activity.
The implementation of the project would generate GHG emission removals and improve
local environment by planting trees, enhance biodiversity conservation and climate
change adaptation, improve soil and water conservation in project zone, strengthening the
lifelihood skills of local communities and residents by providing their relevant technical
skills and training and create more permanent job opportunities for local women and
increase income for local communities.

1.10 Project Scale and Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals
The project activity falls under small-scale project category since the annual average GHG
emission reductions are less than 300,000 tCO e. 2
1.11 Description of the Project Activity
The project activity intends to tap the waste heat of the exit gases from preheater, AQC and
also DG by the Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) captive power plant consisting of WHR boilers,
steam turbine and generator.
The project activity includes installation of 6 WHR boilers (4 for preheater exit gas and one
each for clinker cooler exit gas and DG exit gas) and one 13.2 MW steam turbine generator.
The project activity generates electricity from this generation system that would replace
equivalent amount of electricity supplied by the grid thereby reducing the emission of CO 2
from burning of fossil fuels at thermal power plants supplying power to the grid. The system
consists of four sets of WHR preheater boilers equipped with evaporator and super-heater,
8


Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
This project activity intends to eliminate the need for importing 13.25 MW from AVVNL and
generate it in-house by installation of the Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) Captive Power Plant,
utilizing the exit gases from preheater, AQC and also DG. In the absence of the project
activity, the power demand would have been met by grid which is predominantly based on
fossil-fuel fired generation plants. The project activity itself, would not contribute to any
additional GHG emissions since the chemical composition of the waste gas at the inlet and
outlet of the WHR boilers remains same and no other secondary fuel is fed in the boiler.
Thereby the project activity reduces the dependence on fossil fuel based generation units
and as there are no associated emissions with this project it contributes to the reduction of
greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions.
1.14 Compliance with Laws, Statutes and Other Regulatory Frameworks
There is no a legal requirement for cement industries in India to utilize the heat content of
waste gases from the manufacturing process to generate electricity. The project proponent
would implement the project activity over and above the national or sectoral requirements
with an objective to utilize waste resources available from manufacturing process and use it
to generate electricity for its own utilization. The project proponent received the Consent to
Operate from local Pollution Control Board. It also received Host Country Approval (HCA)
from India’s CDM DNA – Ministry of Environment and Forest for registration in UNFCCC
CDM. In the absence of the project activity the equivalent electricity requirement of the
facility would be met by AVVNL grid supply resulting in CO emissions from the thermal 2
power stations (supplying electricity to grid). However, due to project activity, project
proponent would be able to replace equivalent amount of generation mix, resulting in
reduction of corresponding CO emissions at the thermal power plants. 2

No leakage emissions are considered in accordance with the applied methodology ACM004,
Version 01
Commercially Sensitive Information
There is no commercially sensitive information accounted for the determination of baseline,
net GHG removals and for demonstration of additionality for the present project activity.
Sustainable Development
JKCL believes that project activity would lead to sustainable economic and industrial growth
in the long run and help conserving natural resources like coal. Various benefits associated
are as follows:
Social Well-being - Project activity would increase small fraction of employment for semi-
skilled and skilled labour and professionals in the region by providing direct and indirect
employment.
Economic Well-being - The project activity brings in related economic benefits for the local
community and would lead to sustainable economic and industrial growth in the region. The
project activity shows less dependence of project proponent on grid-supplied electricity.
Environmental Well-being- A major share of the region’s electricity is generated from fossil
fuel sources, mostly from coal based thermal power plants. The project activity would be
able to displace/ replace electricity generated by grid-connected power plant thus saving
further exploitation and depletion of natural resources – coal, or else increasing its
availability to other important processes.

1.13 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
The project is a Greenfield rooftop solar power project and does not involve generation of GHG
emissions for the purpose of their subsequent reduction, removal or destruction. Thus prior to
project initiation, there was nothing at site. In absence of project activity, the continuation of
current practice i.e. generation of equivalent amount electricity would have been generated
from grid connected fossil fuel dominated power plants. Thus, for project activity baseline
scenario is electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been
generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new
generation sources.

"What are the methodologies of this project?","Based on the provided information, the methodology of this project involves several steps:

1. Determining Additionality and Investment Barrier: The project aims to demonstrate additionality, which means proving that the proposed project activity is not economically or financially feasible without revenue from the sale of certified emission reductions (CERs). In this case, the project involves providing fruit trees to communities and farmers for agroforestry, which does not generate revenue. Therefore, an investment analysis is deemed non-applicable.

2. Methodology Deviations: The project uses an area-based approach with a deviation that sets leakage to 0. Leakage refers to the inadvertent transfer of emissions. Since the project matches the requirements of the VCS-VM0047 standard for a census-based approach, where continuous vegetative cover is not produced on any contiguous area exceeding one hectare, leakage is set to 0.

3. Satellite Imagery for Stocking Index Calculations: The project utilizes satellite images to calculate stocking indexes, which measure the density of trees in a given area. Complete coverage for the dry season is preferred to minimize the effect of grass vegetation. However, for the year 2010, there are not enough images available, so the coverage from 2009 will be used as an initial reference. Satellite coverages for the years 2011 and 2012 are not available, so those years will be skipped for stocking index calculations.

4. Implementation Status: The project implementation is reported to be on track, following the business plan and approved methodologies. A monitoring plan is in place, which includes steps such as geo mapping of cashew fields, random sampling of plots, carbon estimation through field measurements and remote sensing, and determining additionality and baseline through performance benchmarking.

5. Stakeholder Engagement: The project has conducted a thorough stakeholder mapping and has an engagement plan in place. Local Stakeholder Consultations (LSC) have been ongoing throughout the project life to address concerns, enhance transparency, and build confidence in the project.

Overall, the methodology involves demonstrating additionality, using an area-based approach with a deviation for leakage, utilizing satellite imagery for stocking index calculations, and following a monitoring plan while engaging with stakeholders.","

VCS Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report Template, v4.3
Since parameters ΔSI and ΔSI were deemed significantly different (via Z test control,t=4 wp,t=4
applied as shown in equation (A5) of VCS VM0047), the project demonstrates additionality for
the performance benchmark in the first verification at time t=4. The result of the Z test
performed is 2.071, and the full process followed to obtain it is outlined in section 7.2. Baseline
emissions.
Investment barrier
As per the Tool 1 Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality - Version 07.0.0
the aim of the present step is to determine whether the proposed project activity is not
economically or financially feasible, without the revenue from the sale of certified emission
reductions (CERs). As the project consists in providing freely to the communities and farmers
fruit trees in order for them to introduce agroforestry, raising their own revenues, there is no
revenue for the project activity, thus the investment analysis is non applicable.
3.6 Methodology Deviations
The project uses an area-based approach to all its territories with a deviation that set
leakage is set 0 as the project matches almost totally with the VCS - VM0047 requirement for
census-based approach of “not produce continuous vegetative cover (associated with the
planting units) on any contiguous area exceeding one hectare”. This requirement justifies that
in this type of project leakage is set to 0, and there are no pre-existing activities that could
inadvertently transfer emissions (leakages).
The objective of the project was to plant millions of trees in an immense territory on the lands
of thousands of small subsistence farmers, to benefit local communities, and due to the
characteristics of land ownership in Zambia, this means that some plots have an area less
than 1ha, although the average of the 1,715 plots finally included in the project is 1.22 ha.
A few plantation plots (only 7, less than 0.3%), are smaller than 0.09 ha or narrower than 30
meters, equivalent to just one Landsat pixel (30x30 meters, or 0.09 ha) so for the generation
of the performance benchmark project plots must be eliminated from the selection to ensure
having good quality stocking indexes calculations.
Satellite images have been chosen to have each year a complete coverage for the dry season,
to minimize the effect of grass vegetation, when available. However, for year 2010 (t-10) there
are not enough images to have a complete coverage of the area and some of the images have
clouds that affect the project plots, so a coverage for year 2009 (complete and cloud free
withing the working area) will be used as initial reference.

4 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
4.1 Implementation Status of the Project Activity
The project implementation is on track as aligned with the business plan that details the targets
and the milestones. The project activities building on to its establishment and consequent
implementation have all been in compliance with the approved methodologies (including the
VERRA standard) being applied and the safeguards. The Project has followed all the
recommendations in the Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA for the CIDP)
as summarized in the Environmental Social Management Plan. A monitoring plan is in place
and will be adhered to throughout the project monitoring period covering mainly the following
key steps;
1. Geo Mapping of the Cashew fields using a designed project specific app
2. Random sampling (using R Program) of the plots in the cashew field growing areas
across the Project Landscape for carbon estimation. With the selection of the plots,
the carbon in each of the plots is quantified through the field measurements and remote
sensing determining emissions reductions (or removals) and providing the basis for
ascertaining project performance.
3. Additionality and the baseline of the project are determined with the performance
benchmark, comparing the project plots with the control plots.
Currently, data and documentation for the verification process are being collected
systematically and prepared along with the project implementation activities.
A thorough stakeholder mapping has been conducted and the engagement plan in place to
provide the basis for integrating concerns in the design and implementation strategy. The Local
Stakeholder Consultations (LSC) has created awareness and built confidence in the project
thereby enhancing transparency and addressing core issues that if not observed would
adversely affect the project. The LSC has been considered as an ongoing process throughout
the project life.

"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology of this project is the ""Consolidated baseline methodology for grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources"" (ACM0002/Version 09). This methodology was chosen because it is applicable to grid-connected renewable power generation projects that involve electricity capacity additions. The methodology includes tools such as the ""Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system"" and the ""Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality"". The project activity displaces power from the NEWNE grid, and therefore, the baseline calculation is carried out according to the approved large-scale CDM methodology ACM0002. The methodology is applicable to various types of renewable power plants, including hydro, wind, geothermal, solar, wave, and tidal power plants. The geographic and system boundaries of the relevant electricity grid can be clearly identified and information on the characteristics of the grid is available. The project activity exports the generated electricity to the western region grid through Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL). The project does not involve grid-connected electricity generation from landfill gas capture. Since it is a Greenfield project, historical data is not required. The methodology is not applicable to projects that involve switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy at the project site. The baseline scenario includes CO2 emissions from electricity generation as the main emission source, while minor emission sources, such as CH4, are not included. The project boundary includes the project site and all power plants connected physically to the electricity system that the project power plant is connected to. The project boundary for baseline estimation includes all power generation facilities connected to the NEWNE grid. The wind farm (project activity) has a distinctive physical demarcated boundary.","

2.3 Identifying GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs for the
baseline scenario and for the project:
ACM0002 Version 09 specifies that the project boundary
will be:
The spatial extent of the project boundary includes the
project site and all power plants connected physically to
the electricity system that the project power plant is
connected to.
The project would be feeding the electricity in the NEWNE
grid (Northern, Eastern, Western and North-Eastern grid).
The proposed project would have marginal impact on all
the generation facilities in the NEWNE grid. Thus, all
the power generation facilities connected to this grid
form the project boundary for the purpose of baseline
estimation.
The wind farm (project activity) has a distinctive
physical demarcated boundary.

JOINT PROJECT DESCRIPTION & MONITORING REPORT: VCS Version 3
Baseline Scenario:
As per the applicable methodology, a Greenfield power plant is defined as “a new renewable
energy power plant that is constructed and operated at a site where no renewable energy power
plant was operated prior to the implementation of the project activity”.
As the project activity falls under the definition of a Greenfield power plant, the baseline scenario
as per paragraph 22 of Section 5.2.1 of applied methodology is the following:
If the project activity is the installation of a Greenfield power plant, the baseline scenario is
electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by the
operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as
reflected in the combined margin (CM) calculations described in the “Tool to calculate the
emission factor for an electricity system”.
Hence, pre-project scenario and baseline scenario are the same.
Total emission reductions achieved in this monitoring period:
During the Current Monitoring Period from 09/01/2018 to 01/10/2019 (First and last date included)
the project activity has supplied 780,723.39 MWh of electricity, and thus contributing to the GHG
reductions 731,283 tCO e. 2
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
The project activity falls under the following Sectoral scope and Project Type:
Sectoral Scope : 01 - Energy industries (renewable / non-renewable sources)

Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.0
1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The proposed VCS grouped project “Afforestation in Eucalyptus and Acacia plantations for
Burapha Agroforestry Co., Ltd.” (hereafter ‘Burapha’), represents one of the first major
afforestation projects of the private sector in Lao PDR. It promotes and implements
afforestation of Eucalyptus and Acacia agroforestry plantations on degraded areas. These
areas are either village owned or part of governmental “Forest Protection Areas”, which entirely
are degraded by swidden agriculture for rice cropping by local communities.
The plantations are established in the Prefecture of Vientiane and the Provinces of Vientiane,
Xayabouly, and Saysomboun in Lao PDR. Local villagers are allowed to use the plantations for
intercropping or grazing, which is part of the Agroforestry approach of the project. Burapha is a
Lao-Swedish company that aims to produce high quality timber for the veneer, plywood and
sawmill industry. The project generates GHG removals through tree and soil carbon
sequestration. These credits are generated using the CDM methodology AR-ACM0003:
“Afforestation and reforestation of lands except wetlands” (version 2).
Burapha is also FSC certified and managed to plant successfully about 3,475 ha by 2020,
contracted from 23 villages and plans to scale up its plantations to 15,000 ha by 2021. The
future goal is to manage 68,750 ha of forests in total, consisting of approximately 55,000 ha of
plantations and 13,750 ha of protected areas. These protected areas correspond to 20% of the
total area, which are set aside for conservation management.
The main tree species of the project are the exotic species of Eucalyptus cumadulensis or cross
with E. urophylla, E. pellits, or E. grandis) which is planted on 66% of the area and Acacia
auriculiformis with subsequent 33% of the planting area. The rotation period is 7 years and
during the first years the local farmers can do intercropping. Between years 3 to 7 cattle
grazing is allowed on the plantation areas and in the years 3 and 4 the plantations get thinned
out. After the first rotation the Eucalypts get coppiced and replanted after each second rotation.
The project will generate average removals of 130.2 t CO2/ha. Over a crediting period of 20
years the project will generate 408,682 tCO e and 20,434 tCO /yr. 2 2
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type

Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.0
According to VCS Standard document version 4, the project activities fall under the eligible
AFOLU project category of “Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR).
The proposed project is designed as a VCS grouped project.
1.3 Project Eligibility
The project supports the scope of the VCS program by initiating project activities that sequester
carbon through afforestation of degraded lands.
A) 10 years no clearance of native ecosystems
According to the VCS Standard (V4), eligible ARR areas must be areas that have been cleared of
native ecosystems at least 10 years prior project establishment (Appendix 1.1). Furthermore,
the VCS Program (V4, AFOLU requirements) states: “Activities that convert native ecosystems to
generate GHG credits are not eligible under the VCS Program.”1
Burapha establishes its plantations on degraded areas, formerly used by swidden agriculture.
The occurring fallow forest is not deemed a native ecosystem. If clearing occurred 10 years
prior the plantation establishment the plantations are eligible under the VCS.
In terms of the land acquisition process, Burapha follows a participatory approach to identify
suitable areas for its afforestation plantations, which is described in the SOP “Land Acquisition
Operations Manual” (provided as supporting documentation, see page 13):
“Land seemingly without conflicting land use risks, in particular not with permanent agriculture.
Land shall meet the government’s definition for “degraded land2” and land allowed for forest
production (not flat land suitable for agriculture/paddy rice production).”
Burapha defined a number of guiding principles of this process, the “Land Selection Criteria”
(SOP Land Acquisition Operations Manual, Appendix 1). Amongst others, the socio-economic
criteria mention suitable land for Burapha plantations shall be “land currently without any
permanent agriculture production, primarily abandoned shifting cultivation land and where
there is minimal risk of land use conflicts.”
And furthermore:
“The previous land use shall be recorded, divided on a number of given land uses and the year
of last use of the land for economic production shall be recorded. Representative photos shall
be taken to record current land type.”

1.4 Brief description of the Project
Arbec Forest Products G.P. (hereafter Arbec) operates a sawmill facility located on the banks of the
Péribonka river, at the outskirts of the village of L'Ascension-de-Notre-Seigneur, in the Lac Saint-Jean
region, Province of Quebec. The company sells both green and dried wood, the latter being the
preferred product, especially in the United States.
In July 2008, Arbec bought a nearby sawmill, which had its own logging rights. Arbec chose to close
down the newly acquired sawmill and transfer the logging rights to its Péribonka sawmill, which had
additional sawing capacity. With this recent acquisition of logging rights and the addition of new
production equipment, the production capacity of the Peribonka sawmill increased significantly to
approximately 227 MBF1 on an annual basis. However, Arbec’s drying capacity could not match this
substantial increase in sawing capacity. Before the expansion of the sawmill production capacity, Arbec
operated three (3) wood dryers, with a total drying capacity of 134 MBF per year. Hence, Arbec was
faced with an estimated drying deficit of 93 MBF per year.
In 2008 and 2009, Arbec’s drying capacity deficit did not yield significant impacts on Arbec’s business
because of the overall lower demand for lumber products due to the economic recession. However, with
the recovery of lumber markets, demand for Arbec’s products is increasing and Arbec is beginning to
operate at full capacity once again. Hence Arbec’s limited drying capacities cannot meet the increasing
demand for its products. This led Arbec’s management to consider the installation of a new wood dryer
at its Peribonka facility.
Prior to the Project, energy needs at Arbec’s L’Ascension operation were supplied as follows:
• Three dryers equipped with burners that directly fire butane to produce heat for wood drying;
• A fuel oil-fired boiler producing hot water for space heating of the sawmill building.
As summarized in Table 2 and in Table 3, to satisfy the increasing demand for wood drying, Arbec

1.8 Project Start Date
According to VCS standard, v4.2, the project start date is the date on which activities that lead
to the generation of GHG emission reductions or removals are implemented (e.g., preparing land
for seeding, planting, changing agricultural or forestry practices, rewetting, restoring hydrological
functions, or implementing management or protection plans). For this project, according to the
requirements of the AMS-III.AU methodology applied, an entire cropping season is started from
land preparation and the emission reduction calculation is also started on this day. So, the
project start date was 07-April-20202 when the land preparation was started.
1.9 Project Crediting Period
The crediting period of this project will be using a 7-year, twice renewable crediting period, for a
combined total project crediting 21 years from 07-April-2020 to 06-April-2041, and the first 7-
year period is from 07-April-2020 to 06-April-2027. Also, the project lifetime3 is 30 years from
20-March-2020 to 19-March-2050.
1.10 Project Scale and Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals
The estimated annual GHG emission reductions/removals of the project are:
☐ <20,000 tCO e/year 2
☒ 20,000 – 100,000 tCO e/year 2
☐ 100,001 – 1,000,000 tCO e/year 2
☐ >1,000,000 tCO e/year 2
2 The earliest start date of rice cropping season among farmers which are recorded in the Farmers’ database.
3 The project lifetime is based on the design life of the ditches. The design lifetime of the ditches in this project is 30 years, so
the project lifetime is 30 years. The project's lifetime starts from the date the ditches are completed, so the start date of the
project lifetime is earlier than the project's start date.

"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology of this project involves determining whether the proposed project activity is a ""common practice"" within a sector in the applicable geographical area. This is assessed based on two conditions: the factor F being greater than 0.2 and the difference between Nall and Ndiff being greater than 3. If both conditions are fulfilled, the project activity is considered a common practice; otherwise, it is not.

In this specific project, the outcome of the common practice analysis shows that the project activity is not a common practice. The project activity is also deemed not financially attractive, and therefore additional.

There are no deviations from the methodology outlined.

Regarding estimated greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and removals, the baseline emissions are calculated based on CO2 emissions from electricity generation in fossil fuel-fired power plants that are displaced due to the project activity. The methodology assumes that any additional electricity generation above baseline levels would have been produced by existing grid-connected power plants and the addition of new grid-connected power plants.

The baseline emissions are calculated using the formula BE = EG x EF y PJ,y grid,CM,y, where BE represents baseline emissions in year y, EG represents the quantity of net electricity generation resulting from the project activity in year y, and EF represents the combined margin CO2 emission factor for grid-connected power generation in year y.

The combined grid emission factor is calculated using the latest version of the ""Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system.""","

JOINT PROJECT DESCRIPTION & MONITORING REPORT: VCS Version 3
As per methodological tool “common practise” version 03.1, the proposed project activity is a
“common practice” within a sector in the applicable geographical area if the factor F is greater
than 0.2 and Nall - Ndiff is greater than 3.
Thus if both conditions are fulfilled, then project activity will be a common practise otherwise, the
project activity is treated as not a common practise.
Outcome of Common Practise analysis:
As,
i. F = 1; is greater than 0.2
ii. N - N = 0; is not greater than 3 all diff
The project activity does not satisfy second condition. Hence, project activity is not a common
practice.
Thus, the proposed project activity is not a “common practice” within a sector in the
applicable geographical area.
The above discussions show that solar power development is not a common practice and the
project activity is not financially attractive; hence the project activity is additional.
2.6 Methodology Deviations
There is no methodology deviation.
3 ESTIMATED GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND REMOVALS
3.1 Baseline Emissions
As per the approved consolidated Methodology ACM0002 (Version 18.1) para 44:
Baseline emissions include only CO emissions from electricity generation in fossil fuel fired 2
power plants that are displaced due to the project activity. The methodology assumes that all
project electricity generation above baseline levels would have been generated by existing grid-
connected power plants and the addition of new grid- connected power plants. The baseline
emissions are to be calculated as follows:
BE = EG x EF y PJ,y grid,CM,y
Where:
BE = Baseline emissions in year y (t CO /yr) y 2
EG = Quantity of net electricity generation that is produced and fed into the grid as a PJ,y
result of the implementation of the CDM project activity in year y (MWh/yr)
EF = Combined margin CO emission factor for grid connected power generation in grid,CM,y 2
year y calculated using the latest version of the “Tool to calculate the emission
factor for an electricity system” (t CO /MWh) 2
As per methodology, combined grid emission factor as per the “Tool to calculate the
emission factor for an electricity system” version 06 is calculated as below.

Completed on 7 December 2007
A.2. Description of the project activity:
>>
The proposed Heilongjiang Muling Daimagou Wind Farm Project (phase 1) (hereinafter referred to as the
Project) is to generate renewable electricity using wind power resources and to sell the generated output
to the Northeast Power Grid (NEPG) on the basis of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The proposed
project activity will generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions by avoiding CO emissions from 2
electricity generation of fossil fuel fired power that is supplied to the NEPG.
The Heilongjiang Muling Daimagou Wind Farm Project (phase 1) is located in the Muling City,
Heilongjiang. A decision has been made to install a total of 35 wind turbines, each of which has the
capacity of 850 kW to best suit the local conditions. The total power capacity, therefore, of the proposed
project activity is 29.75MW. The expected net supplied power to the grid is 65,695 MWh per year.
The project will assist China in stimulating and accelerating the commercialisation of grid-connected
renewable energy technologies and markets which is an important objective of the Chinese Government.
The project will therefore help reduce GHG emissions versus the high-growth, coal-dominated business-
as-usual scenario. Furthermore, the project will improve air quality and local livelihoods and promote
sustainable renewable energy industry development. The specific goals of the project are to:
• generate clean electricity
• reduce greenhouse gas emissions in China compared to a business-as-usual scenario;
• helping to stimulate the growth of the wind power industry in China;
• creating local employment opportunity during the assembly and installation of wind turbines, and
for operation of the wind farm;
• reducing other pollutants resulting from the fossil fuel fired power plants compared with a
business-as-usual scenario.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project involves installation of Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) Panels on rooftops, car ports and
ground mounted in the premises of Hyderabad Metro Project by AMPSolar Generation Private
Limited. All the rooftop, car ports and ground mounted solar panel units involved in the project
are implemented under DBFOT model, i.e., Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer. The
owners of the metro project are the customers of the power generated from the rooftop, car ports
and ground mounted solar panels who purchase the power from AMPSolar Generation Private
Limited under long term power purchase agreements. The purchased power by the customers is
used for captive purpose and consumed/utilized by the customers in the metro stations and
depots.
Before installation of the solar units, the Hyderabad Metro premises used to meet the electricity
demand from the national grid of the India. The project thus replaces fossil fuel dominated grid
electricity thereby reducing the equivalent amount of GHG emission.
The details of the rooftop, car ports and ground mounted solar SPV units included in the project
activity are as below:

1. PROJECTDETAILS
1.1. SummaryDescriptionof theProject
The project to change rice planting from continuous flooding to intermittent flooding was carried
out in Wuyishan City, Nanping City, Fujian Province, with a single season rice planting area of
10,492hectares.Withoutthisprojectprovidingditchestoconductintermittentfloodedmethod,the
continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by
continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under
floodedconditioncanemitalargeamountofmethane(CH 4)becauseofanaerobicdecomposition,
the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and
methaneemissionremovalthanthecontinuously flooded.
Withtheprojectimplementation,thecementditches,reservoirsandrelevanttechnicaltrainingare
provided for these farmers to help them conduct the intermittent flooded water regime during rice
cultivation, which replaces the traditional continuously flooded method. During rice cultivation,
controllableirrigationanddrainageaccordingtoricegrowthrequirementscannot onlysavewater
resources, but also reduce methane emission from soil organic matter under anaerobic
conditions(inthefloodedstate).Inthiscase,theCH 4emissioncanbe declinedbyanaverageof
48%1.
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to
254,212 tCO e in the first seven-year period with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 2
36,316tCO e. 2

Anhui Province, located in eastern China with a total acreage of 13,228ha for double-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the backward continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission removal than the continuously flooded. \r\n\r\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48% .

VCS Project Description
1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:
The installed capacity of the power plants for the State of Maharashtra as on 30/09/2005 is as
below.
The power generation in Maharashtra was totally dominated by the thermal route of generation
(Gas + Coal). Thermal route has a share of 73%. The share of RES is 4.4%, which is very less
compared to the thermal route of power generation. As on 30/09/2005, the energy shortage for
2 the Maharashtra was about -7.6% . The actual installed capacity (thermal) achieved as against
the target of 220 MW — for the month of September 2005 — is 620 MW.
The installed capacity3 in Maharashtra was 6.250 MW & 48.750 MW respectively for 2003-04
& 2004-05. The penetration of wind power sector in Maharashtra was just very less. So during
the start of the project activity, the wind power industry was still in embryonic stage. The State
of Maharashtra was mostly relying on power generated from the GHG emitting fossil fuel fired
thermal power plants.
1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG emission reductions and/or removal
enhancements:
The main purpose of this wind project activity is to generate electricity by using a renewable
technology i.e. wind turbine generators and to feed it into the NEWNE Grid. The project

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
According to ACM0002 Version 19.0 and since the project activity is the installation of a new grid
connected renewable power plant (Greenfield) the baseline scenario is the following: “Electricity
delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by the operation
of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as reflected in the
combined margin (CM) calculations described in the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an
electricity system.”
Baseline emissions include only CO2 emissions from electricity generation in fossil fuel fired
power plants that are displaced due to the project activity. The methodology assumes that all
project electricity generation above baseline levels would have been generated by existing grid-
connected power plants and the addition of new grid-connected power plants.
1.11 Compliance with Laws, Statutes and Other Regulatory Frameworks
Till date, there are no regulations and policies preventing the implementation of the project
activity.
The main Moroccan legislation with regards to the environment consist of the following, which the
proposed plant will be required to comply with:
• Law No 12-03 concerning the environmental impact study process.
Promulgated by Dahir No. 1-03-06 of 10 Rabii I 1424 (12 May 2003), lists the projects subject, the
procedure of implementation and methodology of impact studies.
This Act establishes the creation of a national committee and regional committees entrusted with
the review of the environmental impact studies.
• Law No 11-03 concerning the protection and improvement of the environment.
This law sets the general framework for the protection of the environment in Morocco, by
identifying:
o Principles of environmental protection related to human settlements and the protection of nature
and natural resources;
o Principle for establishing discharge standards and the definition of nuisances;
o Management tools and protection of the environment that are described within the impact
studies, plans and standards.
o Standards of environmental quality and financial and tax incentives. The law also establishes a
national fund for the protection and enhancement of the environment;

It falls under Sectoral Scope 14: Agriculture, Forest, and other Land Use (AFOLU) and is categorized as a Reduction Emission from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) project.","

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The North Pikounda REDD+ Project (the Project) is a reducing emission from deforestation and
degradation plus conservation and sustainable forestry (REDD+) project designed to protect 92,530
hectares (ha) of unlogged native Congolese forest, legally designated as a selective logging
concession. The area is comprised of 60% of dry land mixed forest and 40% of areas designated as
wetlands. The anticipated selective logging would normally have been undertaken on the dry lands,
consisting on an area of 55,950 ha. Those dry lands constitute the project crediting area.
The concession is owned by Congolaise Industrielle des Bois (CIB) which has been established as a
timber operator in the North of Congo since 1968. The company currently has five active sawmills,
dryers and moulding units in Pokola and Loundoungou and employs over 900 people permanently
and more than 100 subcontractors. Four forest concessions are allocated to the CIB and all have
been engaged in sustainable forest management for several years. CIB was the first timber company
to submit a Forest Management Plan in Congo in 2005 and the first to become FSC certified in 2006.
The North Pikounda Unité Forestière d’Exploitation or Forest Exploitation Unit (UFE) was allocated to
CIB by Ministerial Decree in 2002 and is 92,530 ha (the Project Area).
The Project is located in the Northern Congo region of Sangha, of the Northern Congo forest sector.
The UFE is part of Pikounda Unité Forestière d’Aménagement (UFA)– a Forest Management Unit
(FMU), which is divided in two UFEs:
1. North Pikounda UFE, designated for timber extraction being allocated to CIB, and;
2. South Pikounda UFE, has been decreed to become ""Tokou-Pikounda Protected
Area.”
The main activity of the North Pikounda REDD+ Project is the cancelation of the planned degradation
activities and the decision to instead protect the forest area, while maintaining and protecting the
biodiversity of the area. This is particularly important as the Project Area has considerable
biodiversity, including one of the largest known lowland gorilla populations in the Congo basin.
From the implementation of the Project, it is estimated that around 4,900,000 tonnes of GHG
emissions will be avoided which would have been emitted into the atmosphere over a period of 30
years in the absence of the Project, not including the Project’s Non-Permanence Risk Buffer amount,
leakage, if any, which will be accounted for over the life of the project.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
Sectoral Scope 14: Agriculture, Forest and other Land Use (AFOLU).
Project Category: Reduction Emission from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD).
Type of Activity: Improved Forest Management – Logged to Protected Forests (IFM-LtPF).
The project is following the steps of methodology VM0011, “Estimating Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Reductions From Planned Degradation (Improved Forest Management)” developed by Carbon Planet
to estimate the emissions that would have occurred if the legal harvesting of the North Pikounda UFE
would have occurred.
The project is not a grouped project.

The project is designed to include only one project activity (ARR project) in a single defined area (East
part of the estate Oka Ecole 2).
Two types of plantations will be created:
- Agroforestry plantation combining Acacia auriculiformis and Cassava (Manihot esculenta)
foodcrop. The latter are planted only during the first two years of plantation as a co-benefit
regarding food production and do not have any relevance regarding carbon removals. The
Acacia trees are logged in short rotation cycles to produce charcoal;
- Acacia mangium ""carbon sink"" forest plantation: in contrast to the agroforestry plantation
described above, here the Acacia trees are left in free evolution from planting, trees are not
logged.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice
cultivation is conducted in Tongnan District, Chongqing City, where located in southwestern China
with a total acreage of 19,190 ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this
project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the backward
continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by
continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under
flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic
decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation,
production increase and less methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.
The implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir
construction and necessary training for the farmers to help them conduct the intermittent flooded
water regime during rice cultivation, which replaces the traditional continuously flooded method.
Controllable irrigation and drainage according to the needs of rice growth can not only save water
resources, but also reduce methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic
conditions (flooded state) In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%.
Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 3.12
tCO2e/ha for rice is expected.
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to
419,076 tCO in the first seven-year period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 2e
59,868 tCO 2e.
This project aims to:
- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes.
- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers.
- Provide more job opportunities, especially female workers.
- Use a proportion of benefits to improve the local children’s education.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
The project is developed under VCS scope 14 “Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)”
with an activity category of Improved Cropland Management (ICM) under Agricultural Land
Management (ALM). Although the AMS-III.AU methodology applied is approved under sectoral
scope 15 (agriculture) of CDM, this project is categorized as sectoral scope 14 (AFOLU) under
Verra. This is in accordance with the definitions of eligible AFOLU project categories set out in
Appendix 1 of the VCS Standard, 4.1 and can be demonstrated from the following three points.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
Prior to the project initiation the users of the solar water heaters, both residential and commercial
13,14 users, were using electric geysers.
With regards to the PV systems, prior to the project implementation, the users were importing
electricity from the grid and/or using a captive generator.
The grouped project has no direct GHG emissions and reduces the use of fossil fuel or electricity
generated with fossil fuels, and therefore has not been implemented to generate GHG emissions
for the purpose of their subsequent reduction, removal or destruction.
The baseline is the same as the scenario prior to the implementation of the project.

There exists no mandatory law or regulation in the host country requiring the introduction of clean
energy products, therefore the project is a voluntary effort by the project proponent.
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) indicated that Environmental Impact
Assessment is not required for clean energy product distribution projects.
The project does not violate any laws, statutes and or other regulatory frameworks in India.
1.12 Ownership and Other Programs
1.12.1 Right of Use
Through the distributing organisation, it is ensured that for each clean energy product the
ownership of the rights to any emission reductions are passed on from the user (of the clean
energy product) to the buyer of the project emission reductions. At the point of sale of the clean
energy product, a warranty card will be issued to the customer clearly stating that the rights to
any carbon credits have been waived by the customer and are passed to the Project Proponent.
1.12.2 Emissions Trading Programs and Other Binding Limits
There is no emissions trading programme or binding limit on GHG emissions in India that applies
to the users of the clean energy products.
1.12.3 Other Forms of Environmental Credit
The project will not generate any other form of GHG-related environmental credit for GHG
emission reductions claimed under the VCS program. Where available the serial ID number of
each clean energy product distributed under the project is recorded, and each unique serial ID is
assigned to a single user whose details are recorded at the time of the purchase. Products
distributed under this programme carry the Selco logo. A searchable database containing these
details enables cross checking.

excavation/exploration of fossil fuels will also be avoided. Therefore power generation from renewable energy
source will create global as well as local air pollutant benefits. The project activity positively contributes
towards the reduction in demand for India’s carbon intensive energy resources.
Economic well-being:
The project activity will create business opportunities for local stakeholders such as bankers, consultants,
equipment suppliers, manufacturers and contractors during the implementation phase. The contribution of the
project activity towards the infrastructural development of the region will result in an economic well-being for
the local populace throughout the project lifetime.
Social well-being:
The project activity will not cause any dislocation of the local population. Moreover during the construction
and operational phase it will provide employment opportunities to the local people thereby improving the
employment level of the local people. Proper training and education will be imparted to the recruited people for
smooth operation of the power plant and also to ensure proper monitoring of the relevant parameters related to
GHG performance of the power plant.
Technological well-being:
The project activity will result in minimum transmission loss due to generation of power close to load points.
So this will increase the amount of electricity being exported to the Southern Regional Grid thus further
leading to the increase in reduction of GHG emissions .

Project Description: VCS Version 4.1
1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
Renewable Electricity Grouped Project in Africa (hereafter referred to as “grouped project”) is a renewable
energy generation grouped project by Rift Valley Energy (RVE) (hereinafter referred to as “the project
owner” and “project developer”), the energy division of Rift Valley Corporation (RVC), which aims to
sustainably develop renewable energy resources in Africa starting with Tanzania (host country for project
instance). The grouped project activity will support the development of new renewable energy projects
(hydropower, wind, solar etc.) in the target countries (target countries shall be limited to Least Developed
countries (listed in appendix 1) in line with section 2.1.1 of the VCS Standard Version 4.2).
At present, the singular instance in the grouped project consists of greenfield hydro power project
instance in Tanzania owned by Luponde Hydro Limited, a fully owned subsidiary of Rift Valley Energy
(RVE).
Instance 1: The project instance 1 is located in Njombe district in Njombe region in Southern
Tanzania. The project instance consists of two run-of-the river hydro sites totalling 3.001 MW
(1.001 MW + 2.0 MW) installed capacity (Turbine capacity). Phase 1 of the project instance is
the Luhololo hydro (on Mwiha stream) with an installed capacity of 1.001 MW which is expected
to generate approximately 7.1 GWh of electricity annually. Phase 2 of the project instance is the
Igola hydro (at Lufuo stream) with an expected installed capacity of 2.0 MW1 which is expected
to generate approximately 14.3 GWh of electricity annually. Thus, project instance expects to
supply approximately 21.4 GWh of energy annually to the Tanzanian grid.
The renewable electricity generated by project instances under the grouped project activity will be
predominantly supplied to the national grid, besides supplying to local industry/community via rural mini-
grid, displacing the consumption of fossil fuel-based electricity generation. As a conservative measure
the carbon credits will be claimed only for project electricity that displaces grid-electricity.
Thus, project electricity is deemed sustainable with no damage to the environment. According to the AMS
I.D., “Grid Connected Renewable Electricity Generation” version 18.0, the baseline scenario (same as
pre-project scenario) for a project activity that consists of the installation of a Greenfield power plant
(which is the case of the project) is as follows:
“The baseline scenario is that the electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have
otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of
new generation sources into the grid.”
It is estimated that the first project instance will reduce GHG’s emissions, 10,208 tCO e per year. 2
More project activity instances shall be included in the grouped project activity subsequently. These new
instances shall be small scale (<=15MWe) grid connected renewable energy projects in LDCs.

1.4 A brief description of the project:
The project under consideration is set up to produce clean power from the wind electric
converters (WEC). The generated electricity is transmitted using the state transmission
system for sale to Electricity Board. The Project leads to reduced greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions because it displaces electricity from fossil fuel based electricity generation
plants. The project considered has used the barren land at Ahemadnagar District in the
state of Maharashtra. The project is helping in bridging the gap between demand and
supply of electricity by using wind as a source for generating electrical energy.
The project activity consists of the 25 machines of Enercon make of 800 kW each,
totaling to the capacity of 20MW. The Project considered harnesses renewable resources
in the region, thereby displacing non-renewable natural resources based electricity, and
ultimately leading to sustainable economic and environmental development. Enercon
(India) Ltd (“Enercon” or “EIL”) is the equipment supplier and is also the operations and
maintenance contractor for the Project.
1.5 Project location including geographic and physical information allowing the unique
identification and delineation of the specific extent of the project:
The Project is located across villages in Panchpatta village in Akole Taluka of
Ahemadnagar District. The location of the units is on the micrositing data to get optimum
performance. The project area extends between latitude 190 45’ to 190 50’North and
longitude 73045’ to 73055’4’ East. The site is located at a distance of 120 km from
Pune by road. The Unique identification number of the turbines is as follows:

1.6 Duration of the project activity/crediting period:
Project Start date: The Project start date is considered as 28 Feb 2007. This is the date
when the first machine was commissioned. This date is considered due to the fact that the
project activity began reducing GHG emissions from this date. The commissioning details
of these machines are enclosed as Annex I.
Crediting period start date: 01 May 2007
VCS Project crediting period: Two renewable crediting period of ten year duration each
are selected for the project activity, since renewable of the crediting period can be done
atmost one time as project technical lifetime is 20 years, the first crediting period being 1-
May-2007 to 30-April-2017 and the second crediting period is from 1 May 2017 to 27
Feb 2027
1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:
The project activity is located in the NEWNE grid which is dominated by fossil fuel fired
thermal power stations. The grid is also doomed by power deficit and hence the addition
of renewable wind energy generation will help in the sustaining and catering to the power
demand. The electricity generated from the wind power project will be used for grid
supply which will increase the ration of renewable energy in comparison to non-
renewable energy.
India has two regional grids i.e. NEWNE (North, Eastern, Western and North-Eastern)
and Southern grid. The project is located in the NEWNE region and hence the baseline
for the project activity will be emissions that would have occurred by the operation of
grid connected power stations and by the addition of new generating stations. The detail
of the baseline calculation is provided in the section 4.1 of the PD.

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
In the absence of the bio-methanation project activity, the waste material would have been
dumped unscientifically and ordinary landfills thereby allowing them to undergo anaerobic
decomposition resulting emission of methane gas. The baseline identified in section 3.4 is same
as the pre-project scenario.
1.14 Compliance with Laws, Statutes and Other Regulatory Frameworks
The Project has received necessary approvals for development and commissioning in the name
of each individual project owners and is in compliance to the local laws and regulations.
1. The applicable law in the waste management sector in India is MSW Rule 2000. The law
stipulates that all municipalities in the country should implement effective MSW treatment
facilities by 2003. Thus, all the above alternatives are legal requirement in India, but the
compliance rate of Indian Municipal Corporations with the MSW Rule 2000 is much less than
50% since municipalities across the country faces acute resource crunch (both financial and
technical) to set up modern MSW processing plant. the project activity being the most
superior form of waste management technology among other alternatives as it involves
integration of more than one technology. Thus, the project activity faces more barriers than
other alternatives.
2. Generation of Bio CNG from waste is not a legal requirement or a mandatory option.

Sustainable Development
The National CDM Authority (NCDMA), which is the Designated National Authority (DNA) for the
Government of India (GOI) under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change
(MoEFCC), has mentioned four indicators for the sustainable development in the interim approval
guidelines for Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects from India. Thus, the project’s
contribution towards sustainable development has been addressed based on the following
sustainable development aspects:
Social well being
The project activity will provide job opportunity to local people during erection, commissioning
and maintenance of the project. This directly and indirectly positively effects the economy of
nearby populace.
Environmental well being
Bio CNG generation is one of the cleanest renewable energy powers and does not involve any
fossil fuel. There are no GHG emissions. The impact on land, water, air and soil is negligible. Thus,
the project activity contributes to environmental well-being without causing any negative impact
on the surrounding environment. Further the project leads to generation of energy from waste
thus solving a major environmental concern for waste management.
Economic well being
The project activity generates permanent and temporary employment opportunity within the
vicinity of the project.
Technological well being
The Project will also contribute towards achieving sustainable waste management in the city. The
design and operation of this project, in conjunction with the avoidance of methane emissions
and production of compost as a soil amendment, will serve as an example to many other urban
areas in the country that are facing similar waste management challenges
Further Information
There are no information or incidents that will have bearing on the eligibility of the project, the
net GHG emission reductions or removals, or the quantification of the project’s net GHG emission
reductions or removals.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
The host country of the project activity under consideration, i.e., India is a non Annex-I, or, a
developing nation as recognised by the Kyoto Protocol. Hence, there are no GHG emission
reduction targets or commitments for India and it does not fall under the purview of any
compliance driven Emission Trading Programs. Furthermore, there are also no such voluntary
emission trading programs similar to the VCS existent in the country. This confirms there are no
emissions trading programs prevalent in the host country of the project activity under
consideration, i.e., India at the time of preparation of the VCS PD.
The host country of the project activity, India, being a non Annex-I nation under the Kyoto
Protocol, India does not have GHG emission reduction targets or commitments. This confirms
there are no national caps on GHG emissions prevalent in India at the time of preparation of the
VCS PD. Therefore, it is not applicable for the project activity.
1.12.3 Participation under Other GHG Programs
The WTGs under the project activity has applied for CDM registration and got registered on 30th
October, 2012 under UNFCCC CDM EB1 with project reference number – 7901.
1.12.4 Other Forms of Environmental Credit
For each of the WTGs under consideration that the GHG abatement benefits for any particular
duration of time can be claimed only under one GHG abatement scheme (CDM/VCS).
Since the project is registered in CDM (reference: 7901) it qualifies for CERs from the date of
CDM registration (30th October, 2012).
The project proponent through the project activity aims to earn GHG abatement benefits from
VCS for the vintage emission reductions i.e. from 31st March, 2011 (project start date as per
VCS) to 29th October, 2012 (Day prior to the date of registration of the project activity under
UNFCCC CDM EB).
1.12.5 Projects Rejected by Other GHG Programs
The WTGs under the project activity has applied for CDM registration and got registered on 30th
October, 2012 under UNFCCC CDM EB and hence did not get rejected2. Also, it must also be
noted that the WTGs have not applied for GHG abatement benefits in other mechanism(s) other
than CDM and hence did not get rejected.
1.13 Additional Information Relevant to the Project
Eligibility Criteria
As per VCS Standard 3 (v 3.3), Grouped projects are projects structured to allow the expansion
of a project activity subsequent to project validation. The concerned project activity does not allow

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The Hubei Jianshi IFM (conversion of logged to protected forest) Project (hereafter “the project activity”)
is implemented in Jianshi County, Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hubei Province of China
by State-owned Gaoyanzi Forest Farm in Jianshi County,the geo-coordinate of the project proponent is
109°33'E -110°13'E and 30°06'N - 30°54'N, the total area is 2665 km2, which includes the Improved
Forest Management (IFM) of the forests in the conversion of logged to protected forest.
The area of the project activity is 7753.86 ha, including 475 subcompartments spreading over Gaoping
Town, Guandian Town, Hongyansi Town, Jingyang Town, Yezhou Town, Huaping Township, Maotian
Township, Longping Township,Sanli Township,Changliang Township,Xiaojiaping Forest Farm of Hubei
Jianshi. All these forests are state-owned forests or privately-owned or collective-owned, and have the
legal right to forest ownership. The species involved in the project are Broadleaf Mix,Quercus and Pinus
massoniana.
Before the implementation of the project activity, the trees are logged based on a valid and verifiable
government-approved timber management plan for harvesting the project area. The implementation of
the project activity converses the trees to protected forest to reduce the GHG emissions for about
1,597,176 tCO2e in 30 years, the average annual emission reduction is 53,239 tCO2e and Verified
Carbon Units with buffer deduction is about 1,245,797 tCO2e in 30 years, and average annual VCUs with
buffer deduction is 41,527 tCO2e.
The project activity will contribute to the environment (biodiversity conservation, rocky desertification
prevention and soil erosion control), thus contribute to sustainable development.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
Sectoral scope 14 (AFOLU)
Improved Forest Management: Logged to Protected Forest (LtPF)
1.3 Project Eligibility
Eligible IFM (Improved Forest Management) activities are those that increase carbon sequestration and/or
reduce GHG emissions on forest lands managed for wood products such as sawtimber, pulpwood and fuelwood
by increasing biomass carbon stocks through improving forest management practices. The baseline and project
scenarios for the project area shall qualify as forests remaining as forests, such as set out in the IPCC 2006
Guidelines on National GHG Inventories, and the project area shall be designated, sanctioned or approved for
wood product management by a national or local regulatory body (e.g., as logging concessions or plantations).
Logged to Protected Forest (LtPF): This category includes practices that reduce net GHG emissions by converting
logged forests to protected forests. By eliminating harvesting for timber, biomass carbon stocks are protected
and can increase as the forest re-grows and/or continues to grow. Harvesting of trees to advance conservation
purposes (e.g., the removal of diseased trees) may continue in the project scenario.

"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology of this project involves several steps and calculations. 

1. Step 5 of the Common Practice tool involves calculating the factor F, which represents the share of similar projects using a technology similar to the proposed project activity that delivers the same output of capacity. The formula for calculating F is F = 1 - N_diff/N_all, where N_diff represents the number of different projects and N_all represents the total number of projects.

2. The project activity is considered ""common practice"" within the sector in the applicable geographic area if the factor F is greater than 0.2 and N_all - N_diff is greater than 3.

3. In this specific project, the factor F is calculated to be 0, which is below 0.2, and N_all - N_diff is 0, which is below 3. Therefore, the proposed project activity is determined to not be common practice.

4. The additionality tool and common practice guideline are used to assess the project's additionality, and it is concluded that the proposed project activity is additional.

5. The official methodology AMS-I.D/Version 17, ""Indicative simplified baseline and monitoring methodologies for selected small-scale CDM project activity categories,"" is applied to the project activity without any deviations.

6. The quantification of GHG emissions reductions and removals involves calculating baseline emissions, which include only CO emissions from electricity generation in fossil fuel-fired power plants that are displaced due to the project activity. The calculation is done using the formula BE = EG x EF, where BE is the baseline emissions, EG is the quantity of net electricity generation produced and fed into the grid as a result of the project activity, and EF is the combined margin CO emissions factor for grid-connected power generation.

These are some of the key aspects of the methodology used in this project.","

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
Common Practice tool step 5: Calculate factor F = 1 – N_diff/N_all representing the share of similar
projects using a technology similar to the technology used in the proposed project activity that
delivers the same output of capacity as the proposed project activity.
F = 1 – N_diff/N_all
F = 1 – 5/5 = 0
Hence, the proposed project activity would have been a “common practice” within the sector in the
applicable geographic area if the factor F is greater than 0.2 and N_all – N_diff is greater than 3:
Factor F is calculated to be 0 which is below 0.2 and N_all – N_diff = 5-5 =0 which is below 3.
Outcome of the Common Practice Tool:
The proposed project activity Yaprak Weir and HEPP is not common practice.
Conclusion of step 4: the proposed project activity is deemed to be additional according to the
additionality tool and common practice guideline for the demonstration and assessment of
additionality.

1.8 Description of the Project Activity
The project activity involves the installation of solar project. The total installed capacity of the
project is 90 MW Solar project located at Karnataka state in India. The project is a bundled
project activity by Greenko Group and the project is promoted by SEI Suryashakti Power
Private Limited.
The Project activity is a new facility (Greenfield) and the electricity generated by the project will be
exported to the Indian electricity grid. The project will therefore displace an equivalent amount of
electricity which would have otherwise been generated by fossil fuel dominant electricity grid. The
Project Proponent plans to avail the VCS benefits for the project.
In the Pre- project scenario the entire electricity, delivered to the grid by the project activity, would
have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the
addition of new generation sources.
The project shall result in replacing anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG’s)
estimated to be approximately 159,816 tCO e per year, thereon displacing 165,564 MWh/year 2
amount of electricity from the gird over the 10 years crediting period.

The project is a Greenfield solar power project and does not involve generation of GHG
emissions for the purpose of their subsequent reduction, removal or destruction. Thus prior to
project initiation, there was nothing at site.
In absence of project activity, the continuation of current practise i.e generation of equivalent
amount electricity would have been generated from grid connected fossil fuel dominated power
plants. Thus for project activity baseline scenario is electricity delivered to the grid by the project
activity would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants

network. In addition, the construction of the plant will also enable organic waste producers in the
region to have their waste disposed at the plant.
The expected goals of the project are as follows:
a) Biodigestion of large animal manure will result in the production of biogas, which will be converted
into heat and electrical energy in the cogeneration plant. The obtained heat energy will be used for the
plant's internal needs. The energy can be economically evaluated.
b) The collected animal manure will be digested and sterilized into a more stable form and will be
transformed into a hygienic, odorless, and environmentally friendly fermented product.
c) The fermented product will contain less odor and more free nitrogen (N) compared to raw manure.
The potentially harmful organisms and pathogens that may be present in raw manure will be destroyed.
d) The recovery of organic waste collected from the environment will be ensured. Organic waste that
takes a long time to become stable under external conditions will be used in biogas and fermented
product production with the help of mesophilic bacteria in anaerobic conditions.
e) CH4 emissions arising from the current manure storage activities will be prevented.
f) Digested animal waste will be processed into fermented products. The fermented product will contain
less odor and more free nitrogen (N) compared to raw manure. The potentially harmful organisms and
pathogens that may be present in raw manure will be destroyed.
The use of animal manure as raw material in the facility will also contribute to the reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions. In this way, methane gas, which is a greenhouse gas, will be used in the
production of electrical energy and heat energy without being released into the nature.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
Sectoral scopes: 01 (Energy Industry – Renewable /Non-renewable Sources) and 13 (Waste handling
and disposal).
The proposed project activity is a biogas power plant project, capturing GHGs, methane in particular,
generated from animal manure in anaerobic conditions and utilizing them via cogeneration units, for
electricity generation. Thus, the project’s type can be determined as “Waste Handling and Disposal”.
Consequently, the project falls under the Sectoral Scope 13, namely ‘waste handling and disposal’.

Cutting is part of the fully mechanized operations at SLB, as at other forest operators in the
region. The considerable reduction in costs made possible by these machines means that skilled
machine operators are much better paid than manual blue-collar workers (at three to four times
more).
The appearance of the farms evolves and differs from the young plantations after the first
thinnings, creating greater diversity and increased luminosity. In fact, the lower density of trees
and the arrival of the sun to the ground allows some development of the undergrowth, regrowth
of stumps, and regeneration/enrichment of the soils in organic matter.
Finally, SLB has measured its social and environmental impact through the company Kinomé and
has made an impact monitoring plan with concrete actions, objectives, and KPIs to improve its
impact.
1.12 Project Location

"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology applied to the project activity is the Grid connected renewable electricity generation methodology (AMS I.D.), version 13. This methodology is approved by the UNFCCC and is used for small-scale clean development mechanism (CDM) project activities.

The choice of this methodology is justified by the fact that the project satisfies the applicability conditions of AMS I.D., version 13. These conditions include the installed capacity of the hydropower stations being below 15 MW and the electricity generated being supplied to electricity grid systems that are or would have been supplied by at least one fossil fuel fired generating unit.

The methodology considers the baseline scenario and the project's impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The project boundary includes the project site and all power plants connected physically to the Southern China Power Grid (SCPG) and the Central China Power Grid (CCPG). The system boundary of the project is defined as the SCPG and CCPG grids due to regional grid definitions and substantial power exchanges among the sub-grids.

The methodology also takes into account the GHG sources, sinks, and reservoirs. In the case of the project, there are two hydropower plants with reservoirs, and their power densities determine the treatment of project emissions. The power density of the two components falls within the range specified by the methodology, allowing for the use of current approved methodologies and default emission factors.

For more detailed information about the methodology, you can refer to the websites provided in the context section.","

2.VCS Methodology:
2.1. Title and reference of the VCS methodology applied
to the project activity and explanation of
methodology choices:
As per Appendix B of the UNFCCC’s “Simplified
modalities and procedures for small-scale clean
development mechanism project activities”, following
approved small-scale CDM methodology is applied to
the Project:
Project Type: I-Renewable Energy Projects
Project Category/Methodology: AMS I.D. – Grid
connected renewable electricity generation (Version
13, 14th December 2007, EB 36)
For more information about the methodology, please
refer to the following website:
http://cdm.unfccc.int/methodologies/SSCmethodologies/
approved.html
For the calculation of the combined margin baseline
emission factor, the approved “Tool to calculate the
emission factor for an electricity system” (Version
01.1, EB 35) is used. For more information, please
refer to the following link:
http://cdm.unfccc.int/methodologies/PAmethodologies/a
pproved.html
2.2. Justification of the choice of the methodology and
why it is applicable to the project activity
The project satisfies following applicability
conditions of the approved small-scale CDM
methodology AMS.I.D, Version 13:
• All individual hydropower stations under the
Grouped Project represent renewable electricity
generation projects with an installed capacity
below 15 MW
• The electricity generated is supplied to
electricity grid systems that are or would have
been supplied by at least one fossil fuel fired
generating unit (in this case the respective
regional grids: SCPG and CCPG)
42

2.3. Identifying GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs for
the baseline scenario and for the project:
The spatial extent of the project boundary includes
the project site and all power plants connected
physically to the Southern China Power Grid (SCPG)
and the Central China Power Grid (CCPG). The system
boundary of the proposed project is defined as the
SCPG and CCPG grids due to following reasons:
1. China has a layered dispatch system, therefore the
grid boundary definitions are determined based
upon regional grids;
2. The project power plants are connected to SCPG and
CCPG. SCPG is a large regional grid, which
consists of 4 sub-grids: Guangdong Power Grid,
Guangxi Power Grid, Yunnan Power Grid and Guizhou
Power Grid; CCPG likewise consists of 6 sub-grids:
Sichuan Power Grid, Chongqing Power Grid, Hunan
Power Grid, Jingxi Power Grid, Henan Power Grid
and Hubei Power Grid.
3. There is a substantial inter-grid power exchanges
among the above mentioned sub-grids of SCPG and
CCPG respectively;
4. SCPG and CCPG can be clearly identified as
regional grids and the information on the
characteristics of the grids is publicly
available;
5. There is a guidance from the Chinese CDM
Designated National Authority (National Climate
Change Coordination Office)7 on identifying project
boundaries and calculating the grid emission
factor for specific regional power grids,
including SCPG and CCPG.
6. Further to this, there are only two hydropower
plants under the grouped project having reservoirs
(74_Puti 1 and 75_Puti 2), and the power densities
of the two individual components (given as the
total capacity (in W) divided by the surface area
of the full reservoir (in m2)) are shown to be 16
W/m2 and 57 W/m2 (to the nearest whole W/m2).
According to Annex 5, EB 23, hydroelectric power
plants with power densities greater than 4 but
less than 10 W/m2 can use current approved
methodologies but have to use a default emission
factor of 90 gCO2eq/kWh and hydro electric power
plants with a power density greater than 10 W/m2
may neglect project emissions from the reservoir.

1.17 Sustainable Development Contributions
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) defined REDD+ strategies
and initiatives as a global mechanism to provide incentives in the forestry and land use sector through
different activities. REDD+’s aim is seizing the capacity of forests to act as CO2 sinks in order to
improve community development based on actions that reduce deforestation and contribute to
ecosystem conservation and sustainable forest management so that measurable conservation results
can be obtained.
With the ACABA REDD+ Project, different activities will be planned, including sustainable
management, the improvement of degraded areas, boundary delimitation, and the destination of
areas for different land uses (agriculture, natural conservation, etc.). Other planned activities that will
benefit the local communities are related to drinking water supply, basic sanitation, and access to
information technology. They will generate multiple direct benefits and co-benefits during the project
design and implementation phases, contributing positively to the achievement of the targets set in
the Sustainable Development Goals.
With the implementation of the ACABA REDD+ Project in Colombia the achievement of seven (7)
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be promoted as listed in the following table:

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project involves a new process installation at a production facility of Propylene Oxide (PO) at
MTP HPPO Manufacturing Co., Ltd, a joint venture between The Siam Cement Public Co., Ltd
and The Dow Chemical Company, which is Hydrogen Peroxide-based Propylene Oxide (HPPO)
technology instead of the conventional Chlorohydrin process. The conventional Chlorohydrin
process is one of the typical processes in the Propylene Oxide industry that involves
hydrochlorination process. In the Chlorohydrin process, Propylene (C H ) is combined to 3 6
hypochlorous acid to form a Chlorohydrin intermediate which is subsequently dechlorohydronated
to PO and leads to the formation of salts. While in the HPPO process, Propylene and Hydrogen
peroxide is combined to produce PO.
The HPPO technology will be able to reduce GHG emissions and waste generation during PO
synthesis compared to the Chlorohydrin process. GHG emissions and waste generation
reductions are owing to usage of lesser GHG intensive reagents and reduced process energy
requirements in the HPPO technology. The project activity is expected to prevent 239,356 tCO 2
emissions in a year and a total of 2,393,569 tCO for a period of 10 years. 2
The new plant will be located within the Asia Industrial Estates (AIE) site near Map Ta Phut,
Rayong, Thailand.

"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology of this project is Category AMS-I.E: Switch from Non-Renewable Biomass for Thermal Applications by the User – Version 01 from February 01 of 2008 onwards. This methodology is applicable for project activities that aim to avoid greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable biomass to generate thermal energy. The project activity involves the use of small thermal appliances that displace the use of non-renewable biomass by introducing new renewable energy end-user technologies. The project proponent utilizes the thermal energy generated by the new renewable energy technology. The methodology was chosen because it aligns with the project's goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and utilizes renewable biomass as a source of energy. There are no similar registered small-scale CDM project activities in the region, and the project activity does not overlap with the non-renewable biomass accounted for by other registered projects. The utilization of firewood from areas without proper management is not considered a renewable source of biomass due to its negative impact on carbon pools and increased carbon emissions. The methodology helps ensure that the project activity meets the criteria for renewable biomass defined by the UNFCCC.","

Cenol and Telha Forte Ceramics VCS Project Description
2 VCS Methodology:
2.1 Title and reference of the VCS methodology applied to the
project activity and explanation of methodology choices:
• Category AMS-I.E: Switch from Non–Renewable Biomass for Thermal
Applications by the User – Version 01 from February 01 of 2008 onwards.
The amount of non-renewable biomass (B ) will be determined according to the y
option “b” of the applied methodology once option “a” is designed for really
small appliances like household stoves and does not fit for the kind of
projects in question.
The project’s emissions from the combustion of native wood are accounted in
the same way as fossil fuel combustion, once it is not renewable and emits
CO . 2
2.2 Justification of the choice of the methodology and why it
is applicable to the project activity:
The methodology applied is Category AMS-I.E: Switch from Non – Renewable
Biomass for Thermal Applications by the User – Version 01 from February 01
of 2008 onwards which is applicable for project activities that avoid
greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable biomass in order to generate
thermal energy.
This category comprises small thermal appliances that displace the use of
non-renewable biomass by introducing new renewable energy end-user
technologies. The end-user technology in the case of this project can be
established as the project proponent, who utilizes the thermal energy
generated by the new renewable energy technology.
There are no similar registered small-scale CDM project activities in the
region of São Miguel do Guamá once Social Carbon Company made a research and
did not find any registered small–scale CDM Project activity in the region.
The sources of registered small-scale CDM project activity consulted were
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)17 and
Brazilian´s Technology and Science Ministry 18 . Therefore, the proposed
project activity is not saving the non-renewable biomass accounted for by
the other registered project activities.
The utilization of firewood from area without any kind of management can not
be considered a renewable source of biomass, since it interferes in the
carbon pools and increases the carbon emissions to the atmosphere, turning
greenhouse effect even worse. Moreover, the native wood provided from areas
without a reforestation management plan does not fit any of the options of
UNFCCC definition of renewable biomass in Annex 18, EB 23.
Furthermore, firewood has been used for many centuries as fuel in Brazil19.
Although, it is impossible to define a start date on which this kind of non-

Alternative 3: Construction of a thermal power plant with the same installed capacity or the same annual 
power output.  Alternative 4: Construction of a power plant using anothe r renewable energy resource with the same 
installed capacity or the same annual power output. 
 
Gansu Province lacks renewable sources, except wind  resources. According to the Guidance Catalogue 
for the Renewable Energy Industry Development
5, other renewable energy generation, like biomass, solar 
PV, wave/tide, or geothermal resources, are in the ph ase of technical research, and not widely adopted in 
China. Furthermore, as per the Feasibility Study Repor t, the project is located on a desert plain, so the 
hydropower resources and biomass materials lack in the area6. Therefore, Alternative 4  is not realistic and 
credible and is not considered further in the assessment of the alternatives.  
 
 Sub-step 1b. Consistency with mandatory laws and regulations:  
The Chinese power sector has undergone a transformation to a market-oriented system, therefore 
investment in a power generation project is an indi vidual power project developer’s decision based on the 
project return and risk profile
7. There are no laws compelling the project developer to develop wind 
power plants, thus Alternatives 1 and 2  identified are in line with all applicable laws and regulations.  
 The main sectoral policy relevant to this Project activity is the Renewable Energy Law of the People’s 
Republic of China, which came into effect 1 January 2006 and aims to promote renewable energy in P.R. 
China. This Law demonstrates the Chinese Government ’s commitment to the development of renewable 
energy as part of the overall energy developmen t strategy, and encourages grid-connected power 
generation from renewable sources. Nevertheless, there are no direct incentives such as financial grants, 
higher tariffs or subsidised loans available for these types of project.  
 
In addition to the above, although energy efficiency and renewable energy were included in the agenda 
for the P.R. China’s 11th Five-Year Plan (2006-2010), there is no legislative requirement to meet the 
projections under this Plan
8.  
 
According to the regulations related to power production in  P. R. China, it is forbidden to build a thermal 
power station with an installed capacity lower than 135 MW9. Therefore, Alternative 3  above is not in line 
with applicable laws and regulations, and will not be considered further.  
 Finally, Alternative 4  is in compliance with legal and regulat ory requirements; however, it is excluded 
from the list of potential baselin e scenarios with reasonable explanation in sub-step 1a.

start date of the project, that is, the land preparation date of the project. In 2020, the land preparation
date of early rice in the southeast of Lianjiang City starts from 25-February-2020, which means the
project will begin to produce emission reduction. According to the AMS-III.AU methodology applied,
emission reduction will only be generated during the growing season starting from the land
preparation date in this project. And from 25-February-2020 to 31-December-2020, the two growing
seasons of early rice and late rice in this region are completely included. Therefore, although the

In the absence of the solar PV facilities, the electricity would have procured from the grid, which
is the baseline scenario. The consumption of renewable electricity produced by the solar PV
facilities will lead to less fossil fuels being combusted, and less CO2 being released into the
atmosphere. The project activities will therefore achieve GHG emission reductions and produce
clean power.

1.13 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
The grouped project has not been implemented to generate greenhouse gas emissions for the
purpose of their subsequent reduction, removal or destruction. The solar PV facilities have been
developed primarily to provide security of electricity supplies to the electricity purchasers. South
Africa has been beset by “load shedding” since 20075, which has affected the security of
electricity supplies in the country. The struggle with erratic and inconsistent electricity supply in
addition to tariff increases have resulted in the exponential increase in demand for alternative,
reliable energy supply.
The conditions prior to the project initiation correspond to the project baseline scenario which is
further described in section 3.4.

providing support, training, and guidance to partner agency technical staff and contractors as well
as mailings and two annual conferences.
1.12 Ownership and Other Programs
1.12.1 Right of Use
Agreements confirming ownership of any and all GHG emission reductions created for all dwellings
will be tracked and maintained in the CDR. The recipients of weatherization voluntarily complete an
agreement transferring ownership of carbon emissions reductions to NASCSP for the purpose of
expanding the WAP. States enter an agreement with NASCSP validating the transfer of ownership
of Carbon Credits from recipients of weatherization services to NASCSP.
1.12.2 Emissions Trading Programs and Other Binding Limits
For states that participate in RGGI, pursuant to which GHG emissions from certain electricity
generators in the state are regulated and subject to reduction targets for those states, the project
activity described in this project document does not count emission reductions resulting from
electricity efficiency improvements within a dwelling, only emission reductions from avoided fossil
fuel consumption. This eliminates any risk of double counting. The CDR tracks the documentation
and calculations exclude electricity savings and associated carbon emissions savings. This is
determined individually with each RGGI-participating state, as some RGGI states may be able to
count the emissions reductions.
1.12.3 Participation under Other GHG Programs
The project has not applied for registration under any other GHG program.
1.12.4 Other Forms of Environmental Credit
The project is being developed solely under the VCS with the intention of generating VCUs.
1.12.5 Projects Rejected by Other GHG Programs
The project has not applied for registration under any other GHG program and has not been
rejected by any other GHG program.

"What is the project summary, province, country, latitude, and longitude of this project?","Project Summary: The project involves the installation of a 7.2 MT/hour rice husk-based steam boiler to replace a 5 MT/hour coal-fired boiler. The project aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by displacing coal and avoiding the emission of methane from rice husk decay. It also contributes to the reduction of fossil fuel use for thermal energy production.

Longitude: 105°59’56.89’’E","

and due to natural decay in the absence of the project activity, the rice husks used in
the project would have emitted methane. Thus, in addition to reducing GHG
emissions through displacing coal, the project avoids emission of methane.
The project prevents the generation and release of methane into the atmosphere, apart
from causing local environmental problems such as river congestion and ecological
damage, and at the same time, contributes to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission
reduction by avoiding potential use of fossil fuels (in this case, coal) for thermal
energy production.

identification and delineation of the specific extent of the project:
The project will be located at Hau Thanh Commune, Cai Be District, Tien Giang

1.6 Duration of the project activity/crediting period:
The PP has proceeded with this project involving the installation of a 7.2 MT/hour
rice husk based steam boiler (refer section 1.4). The initial financial commitment for
the project was made on 31 July 2008 based on the ‘Authorised Financial Capital
Expenditure’ (“AFCE”) which is a management level approval document to evaluate
and authorize initial investments for any new project.
The commissioning (total stoppage of coal-fired boiler) and the delivery of steam to
processing plants of the PP, after stabilization of the steam production, was 1 March
2010. The crediting period requested is 10 years. The project is expected to be
operational for at least 10 years and the start date of crediting period will be 1 March
2010.
1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:
Prior to project initiation, a 5 MT/hour coal-fired boiler was used to meet steam
generation requirements for the rice bran pelletization facility. In the VCS project, the
operation of the 5 MT/hour coal-fired boiler has been fully stopped, and a new 7.2
MT/hour rice husk based boiler has been installed.","{'project_name': 'Cai Be Rice Husk Thermal Energy Generation Project', 'project_summary': 'Wilmar Agro Vietnam Company Limited produces rice bran oil, in Can Tho province, Viet Nam.

Additional steam requirement led to ceasing of existing coal-fired boiler without going for any retrofit for capacity enhancement, and the implementation of a 7.2 MT/hour green-field risk-husk based boiler. The new boiler has a rated capacity to supply 1.5 MPa pressure steam at around 198oC.

air pollutants such as SOx, NOx, PM avoidance. In addition to contribute towards GHG
emissions reductions the project will also:
• Promote renewable energy projects in the region
• Contribute to the sustainable development of the region, socially, environmentally
and economically
• Lead to reduction in usage of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, gas and so on and
conservation of natural resources
The total capacity of the present wind power project is equivalent to 48 MW and the annual
average of estimated net electricity generation and estimated annual emission reductions
is expected to be 198.1 GWh/year and 172,406 tCO e per year respectively. 2

3.2 Monitoring, including estimation, modelling, measurement or calculation
approaches:
• Purpose of monitoring:
The Monitoring and Verification (M&V) procedures define a project-specific standard
against which the project's performance (i.e. GHG reductions) and conformance with
all relevant criteria will be monitored and verified. It includes developing suitable data
collection methods and data interpretation techniques for monitoring and verification
of GHG emissions with specific focus on technical / efficiency / performance
parameters. It also allows scope for review, scrutiny and benchmarking of all these
information against reports pertaining to the M & V plan.
The M&V Plan provides a range of data measurement, estimation and collection
options/techniques in each case indicating preferred options consistent with good
practices to allow project managers and operational staff, auditors, and verifiers to
apply the most practical and cost-effective measurement approaches to the project.
The aim is to enable this project have a clear, credible, and accurate set of
monitoring, evaluation and verification procedures. The purpose of these procedures
would be to direct and support continuous monitoring of project performance/key
project indicators to determine project outcomes, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission
reductions.
Effective GHG abatement monitoring and realization of associated benefits stand on
the quantification and keeping a track of the GHG emission reductions the project
results in. The project activity would reduce the carbon dioxide whereas an
appropriate monitoring system would ensure this reduction is quantified and helps
maintaining the required level.
Also a proactive and efficient monitoring system brings about the flaws in the system
if any are identified and opens up the opportunities for improvement.

Project Details
1.1 Summary Description of the Project and its Implementation Status
The project “Agroforestry and Forest Restoration for Ecological Connectivity, Poverty Reduction
and Biodiversity Conservation in Cerro San Gil, Caribbean Guatemala” is a grouped project for
the afforestation, reforestation and/or revegetation (hereafter referred to as “ARR”) of lands in
Guatemala. The project started in 2013 and its main goals are: improve connectivity and / or
continuity of forest cover without negative effects on biodiversity at the community and landscape
level; improving food security and rural incomes; improving the conditions of conservation and
protected area management at the regional level, including better community resilience to climate
change; climate change mitigation; recover watersheds; reduce erosion; and generate
sustainable incomes for farmers.
The project proponent of this grouped project is an international private fund “Livelihoods Fund”
(LIVELIHOODS), co-managed by private companies (Danone, Crédit Agricole, CDC Climat,
Schneider Electric, Michelin, Groupe La Poste, Hermès, Voyageurs du Monde, Firmenich and
SAP).
The project implementing partner, of the first project activity instances, is the Guatemalan NGO
“Fundación para el Ecodesarrollo y la Conservación” (FUNDAECO). FUNDAECO is a private,
non-political and not-for-profit organization dedicated to Nature Conservation and Sustainable
Community Development. It was created in 1990, and has a history of more than 20 years of
environmental work in Guatemala and Central America. FUNDAECO is registered as a co-
managing partner in the National Protected Areas Council (CONAP).
First project activity instances pretend the afforestation, reforestation and restoration of 4,000 ha1
using four different planting systems: mixed forest trees plantations, mixed fruit tree family
orchards, rubber tree plantations and agroforestry systems in degraded lands. Project will be
implemented in more than 20 rural communities located in the buffer zone, multiple use zone and
zones of influence of the Cerro San Gil Protected Area, Department of Izabal. Project will consist
in ARR activities in small lands owned by local people/communities. Local people, with the
support of FUNDAECO, will be in charge of the implementation of project activities. This type
ARR projects promotes the sustainable development in the Region, brings benefits to the
communities, improves connectivity and / or continuity of forest cover without negative effects on
biodiversity at the community and landscape level and protects the existent natural resources.
The land uses previous to the project activity are croplands and grasslands in degraded lands.
Potential project leakage and non-permanence risk factors will be monitored and managed by
FUNDAECO following the guidelines included in this PD&MR document and in the internal project
documents.
The annual average GHG removals by sinks, in the first project activity instance (2013-2016), are
estimated ex–ante as 39,499.38 tCO -e, with a total value over the crediting period of 2
1,184,981.42 tCO -e. 2

generation from renewable sources’  that generates electricity in excess of 15 MW (limi t for small 
scale project).  Therefore as per the scope of the project activity enlisted in the ‘list of sectoral scopes 
and related approved baseline and monitoring method ologies (version 02 Mar 05/07:23)’, the project 
activity  may principally be categorized in Scope Number 1, S ectoral Scope - Energy industries 
(renewable/ non-renewable sources). 
 
 A.4.3.  Technology to be employed by the project a ctivity :  
>> 
The Project involves 38 wind energy converters (WEC s) of Enercon make (600 kW E-40) with internal 
electrical lines connecting the Project with local evacuation facility.  The WECs generates 3-phase 
power at 400V, which is stepped up to 33 KV. The Pr oject can operate in the frequency range of 47.5–
51.5 Hz and in the voltage range of 400 V ± 12.5%. The other salient features of the state-of-art-
technology are: 
• Gearless Construction - Rotor & Generator Mounted o n same shaft eliminating the Gearbox. 
• Variable speed function – has the speed range of 18  to 33 RPM thereby ensuring optimum 
efficiency at all times.   
• Variable Pitch functions ensuring maximum energy ca pture. 
• Near Unity Power Factor at all times. 
• Minimum drawal (less than 1% of kWh generated) of R eactive Power from the grid. 
• No voltage peaks at any time. 
• Operating range of the WEC with voltage fluctuation  of -20 to +20%. 
• Less Wear & Tear since the system eliminates mechan ical brake, which are not needed due to low 
speed generator which runs at maximum speed of 33 r pm and uses Air Brakes. 
• Three Independent Braking System. 
• Generator achieving rated output at only 33 rpm. 
• Incorporates lightning protection system, which inc ludes blades. 
• Starts generation of power at wind speed of 3 m/s.

An eligibility analysis has been developed taking into account all the eligibility criteria proposed by
the VCS to define de project area of the first instance. For the inclusion of any new eligible areas
as instances willing to participate within the proposed grouped project, the new areas shall meet
with the criteria established by the methodology to define the area for the first instance (see next
sub section). In addition to this, the new project areas shall meet with the following criteria:
a) The new instances shall meet the applicability conditions set out in the methodology applied
to the project:
 The project activity should be under the control of the project participants (PPs).
 The VCS project activity may contain more than one discrete area of land.
 Project areas are only eligible if the area had not been a forest for 10 years prior to the
project start or since the first of January 1, 1990. This criterion will be proven by ground-
truthing, satellite images, aerial photographs, official maps or land-use records (the
methodology used to define the first project activity instance is described below).

2.2 Applicability of Methodology
This methodology is applicable under the following conditions:
a) The land subject to the project activity does not fall into the wetland category.
The project complies with this condition. The land cover in the grouped project area is degraded pasture.
Without intervention, it is expected that this cover would remain or that it would be partially reforested at a
rate of reforestation that has been commonly observed in the periods prior to the VCS proposal mainly
because the socio-economic conditions that created them are still and will continue to be present. A multi-
temporal assessment of land use changes, using satellite images, was developed, in order to prove the
state of land cover until 2011. These grasslands have been degraded by the ranching activity that
traditionally has taken place in the entire Orinoco region29.

Province: Zhenlai County

Country: Not mentioned in the provided information

Latitude and Longitude: No specific latitude and longitude coordinates are mentioned in the provided information.","

Project Description: VCS Version 4.2
By adopting conservation agriculture practices, the project contributes to achieving sustainable
development goals in the following aspects:
SDG12 Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
The project is expected to make fundamental changes to the traditional
agricultural production which is deemed as unsustainable. During each
monitoring period, the amount of crop residues added to the fields and the soil
carbon stock will be monitored and reported.
SDG 13 Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
The project is expected to achieve significant GHG removals, hence contributing
to climate change mitigation. During each monitoring period, the GHG
reductions and removals will be monitored, calculated and reported in
accordance with the applied methodology VM0042 (version 1.0).

Project Description: VCS Version 4.2
2 SAFEGUARDS
2.1 No Net Harm
The project is not expected to cause harm to the environment. Instead, the project will achieve
GHG emission reductions and removals, maintain soil fertility and benefit local cropland
ecosystem.
Likewise, the project is not expected to result in any harm in the socio-economic aspect, either.
The project provides local population with opportunities to learn and adopt conservation
agriculture, promotes sustainable crop production, and ensures corn yield and hence farmers’
revenues, especially during years of extreme weather events. VCU sales revenues shared with
farmers will also improve their household income and life quality.
2.2 Local Stakeholder Consultation
In early 2021, the project proponent spent several months visiting villages in Zhenlai County
and had initial contact with farming households to get themselves informed of the agricultural
practices adopted as well as farmers’ general opinions about conservation agriculture. In the
meantime, the project proponent also established contact with Bureau of Agriculture and Rural
Affairs of Zhenlai County to have a “big picture” on conditions of local agriculture development.
In general, local farmers expressed hesitancy, doubt or reluctance towards the adoption of
conservation agriculture. They were doubtful about effectiveness of conservation practices in
assuring crop yield and maintaining soil fertility; they were reluctant to spend money on
machineries required to undertake the project activity; most importantly, there was a general
lack of knowledge and skills among local population to allow them to properly adopt
conservation practices.
After learning about local conditions, the project proponent decided that they would pay for
machineries if required by farmers and provide training sessions to them to build their capacity
in conservation practices.
On various dates in July and August 2021, the project proponent organized theme meetings at
each of the villages involved, invited local farmers as well as representatives from Bureau of
Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Zhenlai County.
On each of the meetings, the project proponent explained the concept and principle of
conservation agriculture; they ensured that they would provide technical guidance to farmers
during the entire cropping season. The project proponent further asked the attendees about
their doubts or worries in implementing the project activity and explained measures accordingly.
In addition, they also gave a brief introduction of the VCS program and its project development
process.

residential area, school, factory and hospital in the wind farm site. The nearest residential area is
more than 500m far away from the wind machines. So it will not make significant impact to the
sound quality of the environment of residents. Noise on the impact of small wild animals is also
small. Therefore, the noise is acceptable during the construction.
2. Impact of waste residue
The solid waste produced during the construction period is mainly the domestic waste produced by
the constructors, which will be consigned to the environmental health department to collect and
carried out from the site. So the negative impact on the environment will not last.
Besides during the operation period the domestic waste produced by the working staff of the
project will be periodically carried out by tracks. The project itself will not have any apparent
influence on the environment.
3. Impact of sewage water
The sewage water produced during construction period includes mainly domestic sewage and
construction waste water. The sewage will be treated to meet the national standard.
4. Main Ecological Impacts
The project site had only some drought-resistant grasses. There are no rare plants. The wind farm
covers an area of mainly grassland, therefore, the project's overall impact on the local vegetation is
not significant. According to the survey, this area has no large wild animals, mammals, mainly
rabbits, rats and other small animals, and therefore, the impact on wildlife during the construction
period will be minor.
D.2. If environmental impacts are considered significant by the project participants or the
host Party, please provide conclusions and all references to support documentation of an
environmental impact assessment undertaken in accordance with the procedures as required
by the host Party:

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Implementation Status of the Project
The International Small Group and Tree Planting Program (TIST) empowers Small Groups of
subsistence farmers in Kenya, Uganda, India and Tanzania to combat the devastating effects of
deforestation, poverty and drought. Combining sustainable development with carbon
sequestration, TIST supports the reforestation and biodiversity efforts of about 87,000
subsistence farmers. Carbon credit sales generate participant income and provide project
funding to address agricultural, HIV/AIDS, nutritional and fuel challenges. As TIST expands to
more groups and more areas, it ensures more trees, more biodiversity, more climate change
benefit and more income for more people.
Since its inception in 1999, TIST participants organized into over 12,000 TIST Small Groups have
planted over 18 million trees on their own and community lands. GhG sequestration is creating a
long-term income stream and developing sustainable environments and livelihoods. TIST in
Uganda began in 2003 and has grown to about 14,500 TIST participants in about 2,200 Small
Groups.
UG PD-VCS-002 is a small scale AFOLU project, eligible under the Afforestation, Reforestation
and Revegetation (ARR) category. It is a subset of the TIST project in Uganda and initially
applied to 17 of the Small Groups, 94 members, 22 project areas and 169 ha. The PD was
validated and first verified on 20 March 2012 by Environmental Services, Inc. (ESI).
UG-VCS-002 was verified a second time 27 October 2014 by JACO CDM. The verification period
was 07 October 11 to 31 December 2013. The verification demonstrated 22 project areas, 154
ha and 150,306 trees.
This is the third verification of UG-VCS-002 and was conducted by EPIC Sustainability. The
verification period was 01 January 2014 to 17 April 2019. The monitoring demonstrated 17
project areas, 141 ha and 116395 trees.
The following is the verification history, including the total GHG removals generated in this
monitoring period

Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.0
According to VCS Standard document version 4.2, chapter A1.1 (19.09.2019) the project
activities fall under the eligible AFOLU project category of “Afforestation, Reforestation and
Revegetation (ARR)”. The proposed project is a grouped project.
1.3 Project Eligibility
The proposed project activity supports the scope of the VCS program by initiating project activities
that sequester carbon through afforestation of former agricultural and implanted and natural
pasture land, encompassing 344.5 ha and 610.5 ha of first instance plantations, respectively.
The following eligibility criteria have to be met, to be accounted as AFOLU, ARR project under the
VCS.
10 years no deforestation of native ecosystems:
According to the VCS Standard (V4.2) Appendix 1.1., eligible AR areas must have been cleared of
native ecosystems at least 10 years prior project establishment. Furthermore, according to
chapter 3.2.4, activities that convert native ecosystems to generate GHG credits are not eligible
under the VCS Program1.
The project area consisted of agricultural fields, mostly mechanized soy, or implanted pasture,
before tree planting took place.
Through a historical forest cover analysis of the project area, areas where conversion of natural
forests took place less than 10 years before project start were identified and excluded from the
scope of the Carbon Project. Small patches where conversion took place were conducted by
previous owners (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Therefore, 1.5 ha have been excluded from this
validation process.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittently flooded conditions during rice
cultivation is conducted in Tonghe County, Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province, China, with a total
acreage of 17,621 ha of single-cropping rice. Without the project, there would be no ditches,
pumps, valves, and reservoirs to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional
continuously flooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was
cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Due to the anaerobic
decomposition of organic matter in the paddy soil under flooded conditions, a large amount of
methane can be released, so the intermittently flooded method is more conducive to saving water,
improving rice yield and reducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.
The implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir
construction, pumps and valves installation, training, etc. According to the needs of rice growth,
farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water
resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic
conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice
paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in
the rainy season. In this case, the methane emission can be declined by an average of 48%.
Hence, with the proposed project activity, the estimated GHG reduction from rice is 3.33
tCO e/ha. 2
The project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions by 410,298 tCO e in the first seven-year 2
period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 58,614 tCO e. The project aims to 2
reduce GHG and mitigate climate changes, increase rice productivity resulting in higher living
standards for local farmers and provide more job opportunities.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
This project is categorized as sectoral scope 14 (AFOLU) under Verra as justified in Section 1.3,
although the AMS-III.AU methodology applied is approved under sectoral scope 15 (Agriculture)

1.4 Project Design
The proposed project activity employs state of art technology that uses solar radiation to
heat up ambient water. The Solar water heater works on the principle of absorption of solar
radiation by black body. Solar energy is received on earth surface in form of radiation
comprises mostly of the visible and infrared wavelength. The black body intercepting the
solar radiation converts solar energy into heat which is transferred to the fluid. The
collector are insulated at the bottom and exposed to solar radiation. As the black surface
absorbs radiation in the complete wave length region of the solar spectrum, it gains heat
and starts loosing heat to the surrounding. To prevent the heat loss the collector is
enclosed within a glass enclosure that provides a greenhouse effect. Glass allows
transmitting most of the visible part of the radiation and part of the near infra-red radiation
however it is opaque to infrared wavelength range in which the hot plates emit radiation.
The heat absorbed by the solar collector is transferred to the water flowing through it.
Heated water is collected in the tank which is insulated to prevent heat loss. Circulation of
the water from the tank through the collector and back to the tank continues automatically
due to the density difference between the hot and cold water by thermo syphon effect.

1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:
In the absence of the project activity, an equivalent quantum of electricity would have been generated by
the fossil-fuel dominated North East West North-East (NEWNE) Regional Electricity Grid of India6
generation mix. The same would in turn result in GHG emissions at the grid end as per the carbon intensity
of the above mentioned grid. This scenario has been identified as the baseline scenario for the project
activity under consideration (please refer to section 2.4 of the VCS PD for further details).

6 The Indian power grid system (or the National Grid) is divided into two regional grids namely NEWNE Regional
Grid and Southern Region Grid. These regional grids have independent state Load Dispatch Centres (LDCs) that
manage flow of power in their jurisdiction. Power generated by state owned generation units and private owned
generation units is consumed by the respective states. Power generated by central sector plants is shared by all
states forming part of the grid in a fixed proportion.

"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology of this project involves the installation of a new landfill gas (LFG) capture system in an existing or new solid waste disposal site (SWDS) where no LFG capture system was previously installed. Alternatively, it can involve making an investment into an existing LFG capture system to increase the recovery rate or change the use of the captured LFG. The captured LFG can be flared or used in various ways such as generating electricity, generating heat, supplying to consumers through a natural gas distribution network, or supplying compressed/liquefied LFG to consumers using trucks. The methodology also requires that the project does not reduce the amount of organic waste that would be recycled in the absence of the project activity.

The methodology is applicable if the baseline scenario confirms that the most plausible scenario is the atmospheric release of the LFG or capture of LFG and destruction through flaring to comply with regulations or contractual requirements, address safety and odor concerns, or for other reasons. In the case of using LFG for electricity or heat generation, the baseline scenario assumes that the electricity would be generated in the grid or in captive fossil fuel-fired power plants, and the heat would be generated using fossil fuels in equipment within the project boundary. If LFG is supplied to end-users through a natural gas distribution network, trucks, or a dedicated pipeline, the baseline scenario assumes displacement of natural gas. In the case of a Greenfield SWDS, the baseline scenario is the atmospheric release of the LFG or capture of LFG in a managed SWDS and destruction through flaring to comply with regulations or contractual requirements, address safety and odor concerns, or for other reasons.

The methodology is not applicable in combination with other approved methodologies or if the management of the SWDS is deliberately changed during the crediting process to increase methane generation compared to the situation prior to the implementation of the project activity.

In terms of emissions, the methodology considers CO2 emissions resulting from the organic waste decomposition but does not consider the emissions of N2O from solid waste disposal sites.","

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The Hyundai Steel Waste Energy Recovery Co-Generation Project Phase II (hereafter
referred in this document as the ‘proposed project’) is a 400MW cogeneration plant at Dangjin
Hyundai Steel Mill, which is developed by Hyundai Green power CO., Ltd(hereafter referred in
this document as the ‘project owner').
The project utilizes surplus waste gases including BFG(Blast Furnace Gas), COG(Coke Oven
Gas) and LDG(Converter Gas) produced by Dangjin Hyundai Steel Mill, to generate electricity.
The waste gases created by Dangjin Hyundai Steel Mill are reused by the steel mill and the
rest are consumed by the proposed project. Through this project, approximately
2,306,076MWh electricity will be sent to power grid, and steam will also be produced and sent
to Hyundai steel mill. Without the proposed project the rest of waste gases are emitted to
atmosphere after incineration, the electricity generated by the proposed project will be
supplied by grid.
The Project has significant benefits:
- Energy saving (recycling) by using waste energy,
- Using local energy as opposed to importing energy from foreign countries,
- Reducing environmental pollution, and meeting the current environmental policies of South
Korea.
Additionally, the project is innovative in that it differs from the traditional thermal electricity
generation process, as it uses a high efficiency compound generation system decreasing the
amount of imported fuel and reducing emissions by approximately 1,441,680tCO e/year. 2

to grow. Harvesting of trees to advance conservation purposes (e.g., the removal of diseased
trees) may continue in the project scenario.
For this project, the forest right certificate issued by the local forestry bureau certifies that the
project area is the forest for timber production. In the baseline scenario, the project proponent
harvested timber as raw material of wood products or paper following the Timber Harvest Plan.
According to the Forestry Law of P.R. China and the requirements of the local forestry authorities,
after logging in the baseline situation, replanting must be carried out to restore forests. And now
commercial logging has been canceled and stopped in the project scenario. Thus, the project
area meets the requirements of forests remaining as forests in both the baseline scenario and
project scenario. In addition, the Timber Harvest Plan and logging license are approved by the
local forestry bureau. In summary, this project meets the requirements of A1.3 of the VCS
Standard (Ver 4.4) Eligible IFM activities and LtPF activities.

1.7 Ownership
Land Ownership
In Mexico, land ownership consists of two forms. There are community-owned parcels of land known as
“Ejidos”, modelled after traditional Amerindian models of land ownership. The rights to these lands exist
with the respective communities, and any activities that leverage those rights are required to get the
consent of the entire community, or at least the “Ejido Council” that governs the community. In some
instances where the Ejidos have subdivided the rights associated with a certain domain or piece of land
to a subset of the community, the consent of that subset of the community is required. All Ejidos are
protected by Mexico’s La Ley Agraria (The Agrarian Law) and are recorded in the Registro Agrario
Nacional2 in Mexico City.
In addition to Ejidos, there are also direct private ownerships of land by individuals or organizations, who
have land records to substantiate their claims to the land, and these are recorded in the Public Property
Registry of each state in Mexico3.
Credit Ownership
The individuals or entities enrolling their lands irrevocably assign the right, title and interest to the
Greenhouse Gas Reductions and Removals thus generated on their lands during the project to
ConserWater Technologies Inc (doing business as Boomitra). The individuals or entities enrolling their
lands disclaim all right, title and interest to any Carbon Credits that may arise from the Land. This is
covered by legal agreements with the individuals and/or entities enrolling their lands.

1.12 Ownership and Other Programs
1.12.1 Project Ownership
The Project Proponent of the Project Activity, Southern Power Company, holds the Right of Use
of the Project Activity consistent with Clause (3) of Section 3.11.1 of the VCS Standard, v3.7.
Southern Power Company has full ownership of the wind power plant, equipment, and systems
that generate the GHG emission reductions, and has not been divested of such ownership.
1.12.2 Emissions Trading Programs and Other Binding Limits
There are no local, state, or federal emissions trading programs or other regulatory binding
requirements for the Project or wind power generation in the United States.
1.12.3 Other Forms of Environmental Credit
The Project has not sought or received any other form of GHG environmental credits. The Project
Activity, as a result of supplying renewable energy to the SPP grid, would be eligible for
Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) issuances. However, the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)
for the Project has a stated clear objective to generate verified emission reduction credits (VERs)
instead of RECs, and The Project Proponent will not issue RECs while applying for issuance of
VERs for the same instances of power generation, as this would result in double counting.
Consistent with the VCS Standard, the Project Proponent will track all instances of power
generation and only issue either VERs or RECs in accordance with the VCS Registration and
Issuance Process. RECs in the state of Kansas are tracked by the North American Renewables
Registry (NAR), consistent with the Kansas Renewable Energy Standard.

"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology of this project involves several steps. Here is an overview of the methodology:

1. Step 4: Identify similar projects: In this step, the project identifies other projects that have similar technologies to the proposed project activity.

2. Step 5: Calculate the factor F: The factor F is calculated as 1 minus the ratio of the number of similar projects (N diff) to the total number of projects (N all). This factor represents the share of similar projects using a similar technology to the proposed project activity.

3. Determine if the proposed project is a common practice: If the factor F is greater than 0.2 and the difference between N all and N diff is greater than 3, then the proposed project is considered a ""common practice"" within the sector and geographical area. If not, it is considered additional under common practice analysis.

4. Methodology deviations: There are no deviations from the methodology mentioned.

5. Quantification of GHG emissions: The project uses a stepwise approach to calculate the baseline emissions and emission factors for the electricity system. The national grid of Turkey is used as the electric power system, and the emission factor for imports from neighboring countries is considered zero. The project does not consider transmission capacity investments for the baseline emissions calculation.

Please note that this is a summary of the methodology based on the provided context. For more detailed information, it is recommended to refer to the specific documents and references mentioned in the context.","

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
N = 1 all
Step 4: within similar projects identified in Step 3, identify those that apply technologies
that are different to the technology applied in the proposed project activity. Note their
number N . diff
Table 10: List of projects defines as N diff
N = 1 diff
Step 5: Calculate factor F=1-N /N representing the share of similar projects (penetration diff all
rate of the measure/technology) using a measure/technology similar to the
measure/technology used in the proposed project activity that deliver the same output or
capacity as the proposed project activity.
F = 1-N /N diff all
= 1 – (1/1)
Factor F is therefore 0.
The proposed project activity is a “common practice” within a sector in the applicable
geographical area if the factor F is greater than 0.2 and Nall-Ndiff is greater than 3. Since factor F
is 0 and also N -N is 0, the proposed is not a common practice as per the guidelines. The all diff
proposed project activity is therefore additional under common practice analysis. An Excel sheet
is provided for the calculation.

3 QUANTIFICATION OF GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND REMOVALS
3.1 Baseline Emissions
Stepwise approach of „Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system” version
04.0.0 36 is used to find this combined margin (emission coefficient) as described below:
Step 1. Identify the relevant electric systems
There are 21 regional distribution regions in Turkey but no regional transmission system is
defined. In Article 20 of License Regulation it is stated that:
“TEIAS shall be in charge of all transmission activities to be performed over the existing
transmission facilities and those to be constructed as well as the activities pertaining to the
operation of national transmission system via the National Load Dispatch Center and the
regional load dispatch centers connected to this center and the operation of Market Financial
Reconciliation Center37”.
As it can be understood from this phrase, only one transmission system, which is national
transmission system is defined and only TEİAŞ is in the charge of all transmission system related
activities. Moreover, a communication with representative of TEIAS, which indicates that: “There
are not significant transmission constraints in the national grid system which is preventing
dispatch of already connected power plants” is submitted to the DOE. Therefore, the national grid
is used as electric power system for project activity. The national grid of Turkey is connected to
the electricity systems of neighboring countries. Complying with the rules of the tool, the emission
factor for imports from neighboring countries is considered 0 (zero) tCO /MWh for determining the 2
OM.
There is no information about interconnected transmission capacity investments, as TEİAŞ, who
operates the grid, also didn’t take into account imports-exports for electricity capacity
projections.38 Because of that, for BM calculation transmission capacity is not considered.
Step 2. Choose whether to include off-grid power plants in the project electricity system
(optional)
According to Tool project participants may choose between the following two options to calculate
the operating margin and build margin emission factor:

thereto27. This project will help in conservation of biodiversity and their sustainable use as
agroforestry plantation will help in increasing tree outside forest, reducing soil erosion and
upgrading the quality of soil.
 National Forest Policy (1988) suggested that to maintain ecological balance and to meet the
wood-based needs there is a need to have at least one-third area of the country under forests.
Only feasible alternative to fulfill such a demand would be adoption of agroforestry practice as
this is one system that can provide both wood and food while at the same time conserve and
rehabilitate ecosystem.
 The National Agroforestry Policy, 201428 deals with the practice of integrating trees, crops and
livestock on the same plot of land and deals with problems agroforestry sector. The policy talks

2.1 No Net Harm
This project is designed to have a positive impact on the environment by improving the local ecological
conditions favourable for the farmers as the monoculture farming could be harmful for soil health and
thus, practicing agroforestry can reverse the harmful effects on the soil. Also, this project does not use
any fertilizers and pesticides which are considered harmful to the local environment. The project is
designed to improve environmental services and socio-economic values. This is held in high regard in
every phase of the project development from design to implementation to monitoring. The holistic
approach of the project must achieve better soil fertility, and biodiversity conservation. This project also

leakage is calculated based on a comparison of the percentage of merchantable timber per acre
on the project site compared to other forests within the region (See section 3.3 for a detailed
description of all leakage calculations). Market effects leakage will be re-assed at each
verification but does not require additional specific leakage management activities.

1.6 Duration of the project activity/crediting period:
Project Start Date:
As per VCS 2007.1, the project start date shall not be before 1st January, 2002. The first WTG
of the project activity was commissioned on 11th August, 2004 which is also the start date of
the present project activity. The Crediting Period will last for ten years starting from 1st April
2006 up to 31st March 2016.
1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:
Electricity in Southern Grid is mainly generated from the fossil fuel dominated power plants.
In the absence of the project activity, equivalent amount of electricity would have been
generated by the operation of fossil fuel dominated power plants. The electricity grid is power
deficit and hence the new capacity has to be added in the grid system which would be fossil
fuel dominated electricity generation.
The land on which the project activity took place is barren and unfertile. Prior to the project
activity, the land had no beneficial use. PPs have bought the land for a worthwhile application
and obtained necessary approvals for installation of wind turbines. No dislocation of people is
involved in the course of the project activity. The project was implemented on forest land
leased out by the government of India for the explicit purpose of the setting up of renewable
energy projects.
1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG
emission reductions and/or removal enhancements:
The project activity is a bundled wind power project activity with a totalled installed capacity
of 6.25 MW and is expected to generate 13831 MWh per annum. The electricity thus
generated is sold to the TNEB. In the absence of the project activity, equivalent amount of
electricity would have been generated by the operation of existing/proposed grid connected
fossil fuel dominated power plants. The Project activity will thus reduce the anthropogenic
emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in to the atmosphere associated with the equivalent
amount of electricity generation from the fossil fuel dominated grid connected power plant.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
Pasture accounts for virtually all the deforested land occupation in the project region3. The
implementation of this BAU activity is usually financed by means of initial capital obtained in wood
logging. It is believed that the same pattern of deforestation and land uses observed in the
Reference Area might be fairly replicated into the Project Area in the absence of this REDD
Project.
Figure 5. Map of land use in the project region in 2009, showing predominance of pasture
as final land use in deforested areas (Source: MMA, 2009).
The Project Area has a forest cover characterized as Open ombrophylous forest (As, according to
Brazilian Vegetation Map, IBGE). The following tables have a compilation of data on the content
of biomass in this typology of vegetation, according to forest inventories performed in the region.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
A summary description of the technologies/measures to be implemented by the project.
The Malawi Bamboo Afforestation Project will distribute seedlings of giant bamboo,
Dendrocalamus asper, to individual agricultural homesteads in rural Malawi. The project will
also provide educational support and outreach for the long-term care of bamboo clumps.
The location of the project.
The project is located within the political boundary of the Republic of Malawi.
An explanation of how the project is expected to generate GHG emission reductions or
removals.
The project will generate GHG emission reductions by sequestering carbon in live above- and
belowground biomass. When individual bamboo clumps reach the end of their lifespan, they will
be replaced by a new clump, ensuring carbon remains sequestered over the project lifetime.
A brief description of the scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project.
Smallholder agricultural homesteads are widespread across Malawi. A variety of trees are
grown on farms, in gardens, and around homesteads to serve as fuel, timber, and other uses.
However, fast-growing giant bamboo is not grown in Malawi at a large scale.
An estimate of annual average and total GHG emission reductions and removals.
Estimated annual average GHG emissions reductions: 174,301 tCO2e
Total GHG emission reductions: 5,054,739 tCO2e

applied without yield losses as long as the water level does not go lower than 15 cm below soil
surface.
Relevant technical training will be provided to the farmers to help them conduct the intermittent
flooded water regime during rice cultivation, which replaces the traditional continuously flooded
method. During rice cultivation, controllable irrigation and drainage according to rice growth
requirements can save water resources, and also at the same time will also reduce methane
emission from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions (in the flooded state).
In the project activity, compost will be used for soil application in the rice fields and thus
replace the application of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer.
It is estimated that 58,722 tCO e emission reductions will be generated annually and total 2
emission reductions are 411,054 tCO e in the 7 years’ renewable crediting period. 2
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
The project is developed under VCS scope 14 “Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use
(AFOLU)” with an activity category of Improved Cropland Management (ICM) under “Agricultural
Land Management” (ALM). The project is not a grouped project activity.
1.3 Project Eligibility
As per section 2.1.1 of VCS Standard (version 4.2), the scope of the VCS Program include：
1) The six Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gases:

The project activity reduces methane (CH ) emissions through change in water regime during 4
rice cultivation. Thus, project activity can avoid Methane (CH ) emissions in the baseline 4
scenario. In the project activity, compost will be used for soil application in the rice fields and
thus replace the application of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer and at the same time also reduce
the N O emission reduction. Meanwhile, the project does not belong to the project type 2
excluded in Table 1 of VCS Standard 4.2. Therefore, the project is eligible under the scope of
VCS program.
According to the list of eligible AFOLU Projects described in Appendix 1 of VCS Standard Version

Crediting period start date: The crediting period starts on February
26th, 2009. The first crediting period is 10 years and ends on February
25th, 2019. Crediting period is planned to be renewed 2 times more,
adding up to 30 years in total. This is in agreement with VCS 2007.1
requirement, which sets the earliest crediting start date possible as
March 26th, 2006.
1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:
Description of baseline and its development
The Project involves the generation of electricity and sales of VCUs.
It will help Turkey as a developing country to stimulate and
commercialise the use of grid connected renewable energy technologies
and markets.
According to VCS 2007.1, the project proponent shall select the most
conservative baseline scenario for the methodology. This shall reflect
what most likely would have occurred in the absence of the project. The
principle of conservativeness as set out in ISO 14064-2:2006 shall
apply.
ISO 14064-2:2006 requires the baseline scenario to be identified and
evaluated according to the following:
 The project proponent shall select the assumptions, values and
procedures that ensure that GHG emission reductions or removal
enhancements are not overestimated.
 The project proponent shall select or establish, justify and apply
criteria and procedures for demonstrating that the project results
in GHG emission reductions or removal enhancements that are
additional to what would occur in the baseline scenario.
 The baseline scenario shall set out the geographic scope as
applicable to the methodology.

"What are the methodologies of this project?","Based on the provided information, it seems that the project is related to the generation of steam through the burning of bagasse. The methodology involves calculating the steam generated by multiplying the boiler efficiency, quantity of bagasse, and calorific value of bagasse. The steam feed water enthalpy is subtracted from the steam enthalpy to determine the net steam generated.

The completion date of the baseline and monitoring methodology is mentioned as 05/05/2008, and the responsible entities for determining the baseline are Biltube Core Board Ltd. and their consultant MITCON Consultancy Services Ltd.

The project activity started on 09/03/2005 with a boiler hydraulic test, and the expected operational lifetime of the project activity is 20 years.

Regarding the crediting period, the project has opted for a fixed crediting period of 35 years. No information is provided about the renewable crediting period.","

"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology applied to this project is the approved consolidated baseline and monitoring methodology ACM0002 Version 6.0. This methodology is applicable because the project is a wind-based renewable energy source connected to the Karnataka state grid, which is part of the Southern regional electricity grid. The project displaces fossil fuel-based electricity generation and represents capacity additions from wind sources. It is a green-field electricity generation project, meaning it is not a switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy at an existing site. The project boundary includes the project site and all power plants connected to the electricity system that the CDM project power plant is connected to. The Indian electricity system is divided into five regional grids, and the regional grids are interconnected with inter-state and inter-regional exchange. Power generation and supply within the regional grid are managed by Regional Load Dispatch Centre (RLDC) and the Regional Power Committees (RPCs) handle regional grid-related issues. Each state in a regional grid meets its demand with its own generation facilities and allocation from central sector power plants. There are also electricity exports and imports between states.","

SECTION B. Application of a baseline and monitoring methodology
B.1. Title and reference of the approved baseline and monitoring methodology applied to the
project activity:
>>
The approved consolidated baseline and monitoring methodology ACM0002 Version 6.0 (19 May 2006)
has been used. The titles of these baseline and monitoring methodologies are “Consolidated baseline
methodology for grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources” and “Consolidated
monitoring methodology for grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources.
B.2 Justification of the choice of the methodology and why it is applicable to the project
activity:
>>
The Project is wind based renewable energy source, zero emission power project connected to the
Karnataka state grid, which forms part of the Southern regional electricity grid. The Project will displace
fossil fuel based electricity generation that would have otherwise been provided by the operation and
expansion of the fossil fuel based power plants in Southern regional electricity grid.
The approved consolidated baseline and monitoring methodology ACM0002 Version 6 is the choice of
the baseline and monitoring methodology and it is applicable because:
• the Project is grid connected renewable power generation project activity
• the Project represents electricity capacity additions from wind sources
• the Project does not involve switching from fossil fuel to renewable energy at the site of project
activity since the Project is green-field electricity generation capacities from wind sources at sites
where there was no electricity generation source prior to the Project, and
• the geographical and system boundaries of the Southern electricity grid can be clearly identified and
information on the characteristics of the grid is available.
B.3. Description of the sources and gases included in the project boundary
>>
According to ACM0002, for the baseline emission factor, the spatial extent of the project boundary
includes the project site and all power plants connected physically to the electricity system that the CDM
project power plant is connected to.
The Indian electricity system is divided into five regional grids, viz. Northern, Eastern, Western,
Southern, and North-Eastern. Each grid covers several states. As the regional grids are interconnected,
there is inter-state and inter-regional exchange. A small power exchange also takes place with
neighbouring countries like Bhutan and Nepal.
Power generation and supply within the regional grid is managed by Regional Load Dispatch Centre
(RLDC). The Regional Power Committees (RPCs) provide a common platform for discussion and
solution to the regional problems relating to the grid. Each state in a regional grid meets its demand with
its own generation facilities and also with allocation from power plants owned by the Central Sector such
as NTPC and NHPC etc. Specific quotas are allocated to each state from the Central Sector power plants.
Depending on the demand and generation, there are electricity exports and imports between states in the","{'project_methodologies': ['ACM0002']}","3","3","5","5","1","0.01","541","-"

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary description of the Project and its Implementation Status
1.1.1 Summary description of the Project
The REDD+ Project Resguardo Indígena Unificado–Selva de Mataven (REDD+ RIU-SM) aims to develop
a participatory process to achieve the establishment of a integrated management system of forests and
lands of the reserve, to ensure its sustainability and to mitigate threats of its conservation, particularly
avoiding deforestation through the implementation of a REDD+ Project (Reducing Emissions from
Deforestation and Forest Degradation + conserving carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests
and enhancement of forest reserves in developing countries) that allows providing compensation
payments for ecosystem services.
The technology corresponds to a REDD Project in accordance with standards established by the VCS.
Specifically an activity “Avoiding Unplanned Deforestation and Degradation (AUDD)”.
The Indigenous Reservation is located east of the high plain Orinoco colombian region in the transition
belt between the savannas of the Orinoco and the Amazon forests, in the eastern part of the Department
of Vichada, in the municipality of Cumaribo (Map 1). Consists of 16 sectors and one center,
corresponding to the 16 ancient Indigenous reservations that were unified under “Resolution 037 of 2003
INCORA” (INCORA, 2003) 1.

The climate corresponds to the Holdridge Life Zone: Tropical Rainforest (TRF). Contrasts are remarkable
in terms of the degree of soil evolution, there are some highly evolved that were developed from ancient
sediments (Plio-Pleistocene) and have experienced a long process of weathering and other very young
that have evolved from very recent alluvial sediments (Holocene) [based on (Villarreal Leal , et al., 2009)].

for example, are occupied by exotic grasses, in many cases degraded (Projeto MapBiomas) due
continuously mowing and burning in the dry season to stimulate the growth of new grasses, promoting
erosive process in addition to exclusion of regenerating native plants. In the case of agricultural land-
uses, the activities are mainly conducted by heavy machinery and continuous plantation cycles, leading
to soil compaction and fertility impoverishment (Bot and Benites, 2005; Cherubin et al. 2016). In the
absence of the project, the project areas would remain dominated by land-uses of low-carbon stock
and/or continue to be occupied by non-native ecosystems as a consequence of anthropic activities. Thus,
no restoration activities would take place and the target lands would remain with reduced concentrations
of carbon per hectare, resulting in a small contribution to greenhouse gases (GHG) removals.
The project is expected to generate several positive impacts, e.g.: an increase in habitat availability for
biodiversity and the reduction of atmospheric CO2 via ecological restoration. Significant positive social
impacts are expected to be generated through the short- and long-term activities of the project. The
project will directly provide local employment opportunities during restoration, monitoring, and harvesting
phases and indirectly through activities such as seed collection, nursery operations and planting. These
activities strengthen the local restoration value chain and support local communities.
The project’s first Project Activity Instance (PAI-001) has 365 hectares and is located in the municipality
of Eunápolis-Bahia/Brazil. It is expected to generate 197,517 tCO2 over 50 years, equivalent to 3,950
tCO2/ha/year. As part of the Grouped Project dynamics, other project instances will be added within the
project zone.
The project’s second Project Activity Instance (PAI-002) has 1,200 hectares and is located in the
municipality of Eunápolis-Bahia/Brazil. It is expected to generate 682,727 tCO2 over 50 years, equivalent
to 13,654 tCO2/ha/year. As part of the Grouped Project dynamics, other project instances will be added
within the project zone.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
The project corresponds to VCS scope 14 “Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use” as an Afforestation,

VCS Project Description Template
preparation and installation and the capital cost involved is much higher than other
fossil fuel based power plants.
Renewable energy in the southern part of India, especially hydro and wind is heavily
dependent on the monsoon situation. There are no perennial rivers for hydro power
projects and the wind density is highest only during the monsoons. The lack of proper
monsoon rainfall affects both the hydro and wind power projects severely. Continuous
droughts over three years led to a drop in output from renewable energy projects in the
entire southern region, including Karnataka. This affects the wind projects and reduces
power generation that affects the projected income.
The extent of GHG mitigation due to the project activity is directly related to extent of
power generated in the wind turbines. There is a possibility of lesser generation of
power and hence the GHG emission mitigation due to any or a combination of the
following reasons:
• Seasonal variations in the wind flow patterns
• Variations in the machine availability and machine down time
• Problems with the evacuation of the power generated due to non-
availability of grid
1.12 Demonstration to confirm that the project was not implemented to create
GHG emissions primarily for the purpose of its subsequent removal or
destruction.
The project activity involves installation of the wind turbine machinery for the
generation of electricity by harnessing renewable source of energy, that is, wind
power. Hence, there were no emissions at the onset of the project activity so the
possibility of the subsequent removal or destruction is ruled out.
1.13 Demonstration that the project has not created another form of
environmental credit (for example renewable energy certificates).
The proposed VCS project activity has not created any other form of environmental
credits. An undertaking letter from Mineral Enterprises Limited stating that the project
has not been created another form of environmental credit has been submitted to the
DOE.

1.16 Any information relevant for the eligibility of the project and quantification
of emission reductions or removal enhancements, including legislative,
technical, economic, sectoral, social, environmental, geographic, site-specific
and temporal information.):
The project category applicable to the proposed VCS project is AMS ID. Accordingly,
the energy baseline being considered is as directed in paragraph 9 of the
AMS.I.D/Version 13, that provides that the applicable baseline is the energy (in kWh)
produced by the renewable generating unit multiplied by an emission coefficient
(measured in kg CO2e/kWh) calculated in a transparent and conservative manner as:
(a) A combined margin (CM), consisting of the combination of operating margin
(OM) and build margin (BM) according to the procedures prescribed in the
approved methodology ACM0002. Any of the four procedures to calculate the
operating margin can be chosen, but the restrictions to use the Simple OM and
the Average OM calculations must be considered.
OR
(b) The weighted average emissions (in kg CO2e/kWh) of the current generation
mix. The data of the year in which project generation occurs must be used.
Calculations must be based on data from an official source (where available)
and made publicly available.
With the purpose of providing a ready reference for the emission coefficients to be
used in CDM projects, Central Electricity Authority (CEA), Government of India, has
published, “CO2 Baseline Database for the Indian Power Sector”, Version 4.0,
October 2008. This database is an official publication of the Government of India for
the purpose of CDM baselines. It is based on the most recent data available with the
Central Electricity Authority (CEA), Government of India.
Using the values of emission factors for OM and emission factor for BM, provided in
the official database and the weights provided above the value of the emission factor
for the combined margin has been determined to be 0.9269 tCO2equivalent / MWh.
Thus the emission factor considered is 0.9269 t CO2e/MWh, calculated by applying a
weight of 75% to the Simple Operating Margin and 25% to the Build Margin for the
Southern grid. In order to determine GHG mitigation in a conservative manner, no
transmission and distribution losses have been considered. In order to determine the
emission in a baseline scenario, the emission factor is multiplied by the net power
generated by the wind energy generators. The project emission in the proposed CDM
project has been taken as zero tCO2e/MWh, as wind is a zero GHG emitting
renewable form of energy.
The project assists in enhancing sustainable development in India as detailed in the
following aspects:
Social well being: The proposed VCS project activity leads to alleviation of poverty
by generating additional employment opportunities for the local people of the project
area both during the construction phase and the entire lifetime of the project. This

Tugela Mill discards its woodwaste together with other waste, mainly boiler ash, in its own landfill site.
Due to the increased pulp production of the Mill over the past few years, the quantities of waste discarded
have increased substantially and reduced the lifespan of the landfill site. Previous investigations showed
that if all waste is used for landfill, it would result in a lifespan of 20 years compared to 40 years if it is
combusted.
The landfill is located immediately adjacent to the Mill. It is constructed at an incline so as to manage
leachate runoff, which is collected and sprayed back onto the landfill. Currently the waste is layered and
capped The site is permitted, regulated and monitored by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry
and independent third party auditors in accordance with permit requirements. After compaction the

General eligibility
Eligibility as an ARR project was determined with reference to the VCS Standard. Project
implementation does not lead to the violation of any law, and is not excluded under Table 2.1 of the
VCS Standard. The project has listed on the pipeline within three years of the start date, and will hold
an opening meeting with the contracted VVB after the project has a under validation status. The project
intends to complete validation within five years from the start date. The applied CDM methodology, AR-
ACM0003 (Version 2.0), is eligible under the VCS Program, and the project scale is within this
methodology’s limits and shall not exceed them.
AFOLU project eligibility
The project is planting trees, making the ARR category appropriate. Project implementation did not lead
to the conversion of any native ecosystems (within the 10 years prior to planting), nor did the project
drain native ecosystems or degrade hydrological functions of native ecosystems to generate GHG
credits. Both the lack of conversion and drainage of native ecosystems is demonstrated using satellite
imagery via Maxar technologies, which allow a direct visual comparison confirming no change in land
use on the property in the last ten years (Figure 1.1).

1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
The Project activity is a Greenfield hydropower plant installed at the site with no other power
generation plants operating prior to the project initiation.
The project main purpose involves the generation of renewable energy, transforming the potential
energy of the natural slopes of the river into electric energy. The project replaces energy from the
grid partially generated by fossil fuel-fired power plants reducing the GHG emissions. It helps
Chile as a developing country to stimulate and commercialise the use of grid connected
renewable energy technologies that are required according to the article 150 bis of the Chilean
General Electric service Law Directive (DFL 4/2006), published on January 2006 in the Official
gazette (available at www.bcn.cl).
Therefore, the project has not been implemented to generate GHG emissions for the purpose of
their subsequent reduction, removal or destruction.

"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology of this project is based on the approved consolidated baseline and monitoring methodology ACM0002 (version 09) titled ""Consolidated methodology for grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources"". This methodology is applicable to electricity capacity additions from various renewable sources such as run-of-river hydro power plants, wind sources, geothermal sources, solar sources, wave and tidal sources.

The methodology is not applicable to project activities that involve switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy at the site of the project activity. It is also applicable when the geographic and system boundaries for the relevant electricity grid can be clearly identified and information on the characteristics of the grid is available.

The project justifies the choice of ACM0002 methodology because it aligns with the project's objectives and requirements. The methodology provides tools for calculating project or leakage CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, emission factors for an electricity system, and demonstrations and assessment of additionality.

The baseline scenario for the project is identified based on the ACM0002 methodology, which states that the electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources. The emissions of GHG by source in the baseline scenario are reduced below those that would have occurred in the absence of the project activity, demonstrating additionality.","

SustainableDevelopment
The project will produce various benefits to society as well as the environment. Therefore,
the project will significantly contribute to national as well as local sustainable development,
including:
Job creation: Implementation of the project generated employment opportunities for local
contractors and suppliers, while operation and maintenance of the plant creates additional
long term employment opportunities for skilled professionals within CECIC. For the project,
CECIC directly hired 27new employees, while 300 more new employment opportunities were
createdforlocalpeople throughconstructioncompaniesfortheproject.
Reduction in GHG emissions: Currently, most of the electricity in the region is generated
through conventional fossil fuel based thermal power plants. Through combustion of fossil
fuels, they emit a large volume of Greenhouse gasses (GHG) into the atmosphere, which has
anegative effect on global society.Generation of GHG emission free electricity,such aswind,
displaces electricity generated by these fossil fuel based thermal plants, therefore reducing
GHGemissions.
Reduction of fossil fuel use: the project activity reduces reliance on imported fossil fuels,
contributes to increasing China’s energy security, and also improves local air quality as it
reducestheemissions ofSO andNO associated withfossil fueluse. 2 X

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
Increase of power supply: Due to rapid economic growth in recent years, China is
experiencing a serious shortage of electricity, causing blackouts and brownouts throughout
the country. Such power outage reduces economical activity, and has a negative effect on
daily life. With the new wind farm, the grid improves its supply while contributing to steady
andreliableeconomical growthintheregion.
In addition, the project helps the Chinese government to achieve the goal it set itself under
the Renewable Energy Law. The Law states that the country is committed to increase the
shareofrenewableenergy useinthecountry’senergy mix to10% by2010and 30%by2030,
in order to realize the sustainable development of the economy and society. It is also
consistent with the government’s National Renewable Energy Development Strategy and
Plan (NREDSP) which sets the goal of increasing the share of renewable energy in primary
energyconsumption to10%.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The proposed project activity is a bundled project activity involving installation and operation of 2
Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) having individual capacities 1x2000 kW (G114) and 1x850 kW
(G58) manufactured and supplied by Siemens Gamesa Renewable Power Pvt. Ltd. and 3.5 MW
solar PV modules manufactured and supplied by Diwakar Soltek Pvt. Ltd. with aggregated capacity
of 6.35 MW in Indian states of Karnataka and Gujarat. The proposed project activity is promoted
by Sai Pet Preforms Limited with a view to align itself with sustainable development policies of India
has undertaken this project to produce green power using wind and solar as an energy source.
The 2 MW wind power project site in Karnataka is located in Bableshwar Wind Park at Malaghan
village at Basavana Bagewadi Taluka at Vijayapura district and 0.85 MW wind power project in
Gujarat is located at Village Juna kataria, Khodasar of Bhachhau Taluka falling under Kutch district.
On the other hand, the 3.5 MW solar PV power generation project site is located at Upparhalli
village Hospet taluka within Bellari district of Karnataka. The generated electricity from this project
activity is exported to the Indian grid. Electricity generated from 2 MW wind power plant in
Karnataka is supplied to the local electricity distribution licensee Hubli Electricity Supply Company
Limited (HESCOM), electricity generated from 0.85 MW wind power plant in Gujarat is supplied to
Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) while the 3.5 MW solar PV power plant supplies
electricity to Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company Limited (GESCOM).
The project activity helps in Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by using renewable
resources (wind/solar energy) for generating power which otherwise would have been generated
using grid mix power plants, which is dominated by fossil fuel based thermal power plants. The
project activity is a Greenfield project aimed at utilizing wind and solar energy sources to generate
electricity. In the pre-project scenario, the equivalent amount of electricity would have been
generated by grid mix power plants connected Indian grid, which is dominated by fossil fuel based
thermal power plant. The project activity will thus reduce the anthropogenic emissions of Green
House Gases (GHGs) in to the atmosphere associated with the equivalent amount of electricity
generation from the fossil fuel-based grid connected power plant. Since the project activity will
generate electricity through wind energy, a clean renewable energy source it will not cause any
negative impact on the environment and thereby contributes to climate change mitigation efforts as
well as sustainable development.
The estimated annual average and the total CO e emission reduction by the project activity over 2

2.1.10 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
The project is developed under VCS scope 14 “Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use
(AFOLU)” with a project category of Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR).
The project is not a grouped project.
2.1.11 Project Activities and Theory of Change (G1.8)
The project aims to increase the carbon sequestration and contribute to the local sustainable
development through the aerial seeding on the barren land and barren mountain. 31,049.40 ha
of forest is to be planted through the aerial seeding in Yan’an. According to the biodiversity survey
report of the project, all the project area were previously barren since 2003. There is no natural
renewal and reforestation before the project activity, and some sites were covered by sparse
shrub which would need to be ground broke. Therefore, the project does not include the activities
that convert the native ecosystems to generate GHG credits, the eligibility criteria of VCS AFOLU
projects are fulfilled.
According to the project design and the project approvals, the project is an aerial seeding
afforestation project on barren land and barren mountain in Yan’an City of China, which is not
covered by any jurisdictional REDD+ program.
The implementation of the project would generate GHG emission removals and improve local
environment through growing of the trees, enhance the capabilities of local communities and
residents by providing their relevant technical skills and training, and increase local biodiversity
as a result of establishing a forest of native trees (Platycladus orientalis and Pinus tabuliformis).
The project is estimated to generate GHG emission removals of 21,065,796 tCO over the 60 2
years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 351,097 tCO . 2
Theory of change
As explained in the following sections, the without project scenario may have two focal issues:
1) Continued low development and well-being of local communities and community groups.
2) Threat to local climate conditions and biodiversity due to continued barren land and barren
mountain situation.
The main objective of the project is to establish forest cover in barren land and barren mountain,
by aerial seeding two native trees species, Platycladus orientalis and Pinus tabuliformis, to
address the above issues. The execution of this project activity involved approximately 2,600
local residents in Yan’an city and different counties who were directly involved in the material
preparation, groundbreaking and the subsequent forest maintenance to ensure their continued
growth.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
Junshan District, which is located on the north of Dongting Lake, is one of the major rice
producing districts in China, has a population about 246,516, and annual household income of
farmers is only CNY 35,9321. The project is located in East of Junshan District, Yueyang City,
Hunan Province, China, with a total acreage of 7,925.01 ha for double-cropping rice. The project
activity is designed to construction the cement ditch and reservoir to realize the reducing of
methane emissions by conducting intermittently flooded method instead of continuously
flooded method during the cropping season in East of Junshan District.
In the baseline scenario, farmers in Junshan District use continuously flooded method in rice
paddies with the straw on field as the organic amendment inputs, which means fields have
standing water throughout the rice growing season and only dry out for harvest. However, the
organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH ) 4
because of anaerobic decomposition. In the project scenario, farmers in Junshan District
changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice cultivation. By
controlled the irrigation and drainage according to the needs of rice growth, can save water
resources. On the other hand, multiple aeration during rice cultivation can effectively reduce
methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions.
Emission reductions of this project are generated by reducing methane emissions of
continuously flooded during rice cultivation in baseline scenario. With the project activity, an
estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 6.85 tCO e/ha for rice is expected. Annual 2
average estimation of GHG emission reductions from the project activity is 54,299 tCO e/year, 2
the total GHG emission reductions are 542,990 t CO e during the fixed 10 years crediting period. 2

ranching close to the project area. Of the total interviewed, 4 reported that they use the project area for
subsistence activities, as extractivism, water collection, and non-predatory hunting. The use is made
especially by members of the PA Espinhara II, by those that lives in the boundary with the project area.
An important role in the region’s economy are the small-scale agriculture activities, mainly as a source
of subsistence for families66. It should be noted that, according to the socio-economic diagnosis, the
local communities living near the project area are mainly engaged in the production of crops as cassava,
corn, rice and banana for local commercial markets.
In addition, these communities hunt and collect non-timber products, such as Brazil nut and açaí in the
forest surrounding their farms as additional income, not being a largely subsistence livelihood. It is the
case of these four people interviewed, who reported making use of the project area to Brazil nut’s
extractivism and hunting, a traditional activity that has already become a culture for the region.
More information on the selected settlements is in item 4.1.1.
Internal Project Community
The rural workers working on the project properties, including the project areas, were consulted as one
of the stakeholders, that is, as an internal community, since they will be impacted by the project. In

An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the CGN Inner Mongolia Zhurihe Phase I Wind Farm has
been completed by Inner Mongolia Power Exploration & Design Institute assigned by the Project owner,
and has been approved by the Environmental Protection Bureau of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
The EIA is summarised as follows:
1 The analysis of the environment impact in the construction period
 Construction machinery and construction activity will generate noise. Since the local residential area is
far away from the wind farm site, the impact of construction noise to the local region is light.
 The waste water from the construction site is mainly the waste water generated by the construction
workers. This small quantity of sewage will be treated by deposition in a septic tank, avoiding the
impact on the environment. The waste water during the construction period, therefore, will have no
impact on the local environment.
 The project temporarily uses and disturbs the grass for construction use. The occupied land will be
restored according to its characteristics after construction and will ensure its reutilization. Overall, land
use impact on the local residents arising from the Project is considered to be insignificant.
2 The analysis of the environment impact in operation period
 The noise from the wind turbines is reduced mainly by the selection of low noise equipment.
Furthermore the resident regions are far away from the wind farm, so the noise does not influence the
residential districts nearest to the site.","{'crediting_period_start': '2009-03-04', 'crediting_period_end': '2019-03-03'}","3","1","3","3","1","0","587","-"

Environment and Forestry (Turkish: Türkiye Cumhuriyeti Çevre ve Orman Bakanlığı, TÇOB). A Full
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report has been also submitted to the Turkish Ministry of
Environment and Forestry. At 31/12/2010, a certificate of Environmental Impact Assessment has been
received from Turkish Ministry of Environment and Forestry. A summary of the PTD and evidence for the
TÇOB decision are presented in Section 5 below.
In fact, there are essential positive environmental effects, as highly polluting electricity generation
technologies are displaced by the project. Pollution not only comprises greenhouse gases but other local
air pollutants such as SO , NO , or Particulate Matter, as well. x x
As for social impacts, significant positive employment effects will be occurred especially during the
construction and installation period, where more than 50 people have been working for the project. . It is
aimed to employ local people to add social impact to the project. Moreover, local companies benefit from
the project, as construction services and material are mainly sourced from local suppliers. Management,
operation and maintenance of the HEPP create permanent jobs which require high qualification,
contributing to capacity building and know-how dissemination in Turkey.
In addition to contribution to local economy, the project will also contribute the use of local and renewable
resources to meet the increasing energy demand of Turkey and reduce dependency on fossil fuels. In
terms of fuel dependency, EREN HEPP is expected to contribute to domestic energy production by
reducing that much imported energy, which will, in addition increase air quality and access to affordable
energy services in national level. EREN HEPP displaces electricity from the current generation mix which
is based to a large amount on thermal power plants and will affect the planned capacity extension of the
electricity system. EREN HEPP thus leads to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reductions which are to
be accounted for by verifying and issuing carbon credits under the Verified Carbon Standard Version
3.4., (in short VCS version 3.4.).
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
According to guidance from VCS version 3.4 EREN HEPP falls under sectorial scope no. 1 ""Energy
(renewable/non-renewable)"".The project type is Renewable Energy (REN). More specifically, it is a run-
of-river HEPP project. EREN HEPP is not a grouped project if referring to the relevant VCS version 3.4.

__ PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
Forest Resource Management Transfers
In 1996, the Government of Madagascar passed the law GELOSE 96-025 - legislation that
enables the devolution of natural resource management to local communities. The law allows
the delegation of limited tenure and sustainable use rights of renewable natural resources to a
legally-recognized local community institution (a Communauté de Base (COBA)), in exchange
for a contractual obligation vis-à-vis the government to conserve the transferred natural
resources. Decree 2001-122 governs the implementation of devolved forest resource
management to local communities (Decree 2001-122, Décret fixant les conditions de mise en
oeuvre de la Gestion Contractualisée des Forêts de l’Etat (GCF)). It allows forest specific
community management contracts. Under GCF, contracts are signed between the
government and the representative of the COBAs, the Community Management Committee
(COGE). The request must come from the local community. In 2004, CI began working with
the Ministry of Water and Forests and the communities surrounding the COFAV forests to
implement community-managed GCF sites within the community use zone of the project area.
The COFAV project makes use of the GELOSE legislation in some areas to transfer
management rights of forests to local communities.
Dina
Dina are traditional laws established by the community through broad consensus. For
COFAV, local communities established Dina for the community management of their forest
resources in fulfilment of the GELOSE/GCF. In compliance to forestry law, the Dina were
agreed to and formalised by all of the main stakeholders, including the local communities
(COBAs) to which the management of forest resources were transferred, the local authorities,
and the regional representatives of the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Ministry
of Justice for each of the GELOSE / GCF sites implemented.
A complete list of relevant Malagasy legislation is presented in Appendix 3: Relevant
Malagasy legislation.

1.12.1 Proof of Title
The Government of Madagascar (GoM) through the Ministry responsible for forests (the
Ministry of Environment and Forests - MEF at the time of PD development) is the project
proponent and owner of the VCUs generated by the project activity. All the forest in the
project area is owned by the Government of Madagascar and the government is responsible
for project activities and therefore VCUs generated remain the property of the government.
The Government of Madagascar has delegated the protected area management to CI through
a management delegation contract. The delegated project manager and local community
associations are all part of the management structure and will therefore share responsibility
for deciding how the revenues from the sale of VCUs will be used to achieve the project
objectives through the development of annual work plans and budgets that have to be
approved by the whole management structure.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice
cultivation is conducted in Guangshui City within Suizhou City, Hubei Province of China, with
a total acreage of 13,351ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this
project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously
flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously
flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded
condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH ) because of anaerobic decomposition, 4
the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase
and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.
This project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results
in not only large amount of methane (CH ) emissions but also low rice productivity by 4
replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens
the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. Hence, with the proposed
project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 4.38tCO e/ha for single- 2
cropping rice is expected. Annua average estimation of GHG emission reductions from the
project activity is 58,541 tCO e/year, and the total GHG emission reductions are 585,410 2
tCO e during the fixed 10 years crediting period. 2
This project aims to:
• Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;
• Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;
• Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers;
• Increase in the number of individuals with improved capacity due to diversified
educational opportunities from Trainings.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
The project is developed under VCS scope 14 “Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use
(AFOLU)” with an activity category of Improved Cropland Management (ICM) under
Agricultural Land Management (ALM). Although the AMS-III.AU methodology applied is
approved under sectoral scope 15 (agriculture) of CDM, this project is categorized as

1.13 Additional Information Relevant to the Project
Eligibility Criteria
N/A. This is an individual project.
Leakage Management
The applicability conditions of VM0003 and the VCS standard prohibit any activity shifting leakage
as result of the implementation of an IFM project. As the Lock Haven IFM Project Area is the only
working forestland owned/managed by LHCA, this requirement is automatically met. Market
effects leakage is calculated based on a comparison of the percentage of merchantable timber
per acre on the project site compared to other forests within the region (See section 3.3 for a
detailed description of all leakage calculations). Market effects leakage will be re-assed at each
verification but does not require additional specific leakage management activities.
Commercially Sensitive Information
None of the contents of this PD are considered commercially sensitive information. However,
elements of the supporting documentation and reference material provided separately to this PD,

1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
The baseline scenario is the same as the conditions existing prior to the project initiation. This
scenario is described in Section 2.4 (Baseline scenario). Environmental conditions of the project
area are described here.
Climate:
The annual average rainfall of the Sundarbans is 1,600 mm with annual variations of 1,300 to
2,000 mm. Studies between 1990 and 2008 show that there has actually been an increase of
rainfall over the Delta (WWF 2010). The annual mean (over a period of ten years: 2000-2009)
min and max temperatures vary between 12°C and 28°C respectively.
Hydrology:
The area is inundated twice per day, during high tide. The salinity decreases along the coast from
west towards east (and of course from the sea towards inland). The weather has a high
seasonality, with around 80 percent of the annual rainfall occurring during monsoon (June-
October) (Chowdhury 2010)2.
Soils:
Regarding other geophysical parameters, all areas in the delta generally exhibit good site
conditions for mangrove planting. Soils of the mudflats mainly consist of silt, sand and clay in

Project Description: VCS Version 4.1
-
Project type: Grid connected wind power project.
The project is not a grouped project.
1.3 Project Eligibility
The project generates renewable and clean electricity by using wind power
that would otherwise have been provided by North China Power Grid (NCPG),
which reduces the emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel-fired generation in the grid,
and falls into the category of the six Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gases.
CDM methodology ACM0002 Version 20.0 “Grid-connected electricity
generation from renewable sources” is adopted, which is the methodology
approved under a VCS approved GHG program and is eligible for VCS by Verra.
The project is to utilize wind power for electricity generation. Prior to the
implementation of the project, the equivalent electricity supplied by the
project was sourced from NCPG. Apparently, the project does not generate
GHG emissions primarily for the purpose of their subsequent reduction,
removal, or destruction.
Thus, the project is eligible under the scope of the VCS Program.
1.4 Project Design
The project includes a single location or installation only and is not a grouped
project.

During the sale of the solar lighting , the participating households sign an end user agreement
which is part of the loan application form or are direct agreements between customer and VPA
implementer. The end user agreement has customer information, unique identification number,
product details etc. MEC who is project proponent (PP) has a legally binding MoU with VPA
implementer which clearly establishes that project ownership is with PP. Both these agreements
follow the requirements of para 3.7.1 of the VCS Standard ver4.4 which states the evidence to
establish project ownership should be “An enforceable and irrevocable agreement with the holder
of the statutory, property or contractual right in the plant, equipment or process that generates
GHG emission reductions and/or removals which vests project ownership in the project
proponent.”
These agreements confirm that the ownership rights of the VERRA project and the carbon assets
generated from this project lie with the project proponent. The customer under the End User
Agreement “releases all rights to the greenhouse gas reductions and carbon credits produced by
the use of the clean energy product in the favour of VPA implementors and agree to not sell or
transfer the GHG or carbon credits to any other third party or use these credits for any other
purposes”. The MoU between VPA implementer and PP also states “VPA implementer has agreed
to sell and deliver the carbon credits generated from the sale and use of the product to MEC and
the entire legal and beneficial title, all rights to and interests in the carbon credits and the
underlying greenhouse gas reductions corresponding to such project transaction will vest with
MEC”. Sample end user agreement and MoU has been shared with the VVB.

1.4 Project Eligibility
1.4.1 General eligibility
The initiative entails the implementation of a household biogas digester unit project designed to
capture Greenhouse Gases (GHGs), specifically methane, produced through the anaerobic
decomposition of animal manure. These captured gases are effectively harnessed through
biogas generator units, with the deployed biogas plants adopting diverse models such as
Deenbandhu, KVIC, and Janata. The project achieves a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
by displacing the conventionally employed non-renewable biomass with the utilization of
renewable biogas. This shift not only mitigates environmental impact but also aligns with
sustainable practices for energy generation.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
Huaneng Daqing Xinli Wind Farm Project (hereafter referred to as the project) is developed by
Daqing Lvyuan Wind Power Co., Ltd. The project is located at Middle Songnen Plain of Datong
District, Daqing City, Heilongjiang Province, People’s Republic of China. The project involves the
installation of 16 wind turbines, each of which has a rated output of 3,000 kW, providing a total
installed capacity of 48 MW. The annual output of the project to Northeast China Power Grid
(hereafter referred to as NEPG) is estimated to be 119,760 MWh after operation. Electricity
generated from clean renewable energy by the project activity will displace equivalent amount of
electricity generated from the fossil fuel-fired power plants of NEPG, and thus GHG (CO ) 2
generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation
sources of NEPG (which is dominated by fossil fuel-fired power plants) could be reduced. The
estimated annual GHG emission reductions of the project are 115,397 tCO e. 2
For the project:
The scenario existing prior to the start of the implementation of the project is that electricity
delivered to NEPG by the project would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-
connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources.
The project scenario is that the implementation of the project, i.e. the installation and operation of
16 sets of 3,000kW wind turbines with a total installed capacity of 48MW which will supply an
average annual electricity generation of 119,760 MWh to NEPG, replace the equivalent amount
of electricity generation by fossil fuel fired power plants connected into NEPG and thus reduce
the GHG emissions.
The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation of
the project.
The project will not only supply renewable electricity to grid, but also contribute to sustainable
development of the local community and the host country by means of:
- Accelerating the economy development of the local area and increasing the local revenue;
- Reducing the GHG emissions which are caused by the grid-connected fossil fuel-fired power
plants;
- Increasing the employment opportunities of the local area;
- Ameliorating the energy structure of the local area.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
The Project falls in the sectoral scope 1: energy industries (renewable-/non-renewable
sources).
Project type: Renewable (wind) power project
The Project is not a grouped project.

"What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?","Based on the provided information, the project sector appears to be Forestry and Land Use. The project involves the assessment of greenhouse gas CO2 production/absorption in a lagoon environment used for fishing purposes. It focuses on the reduction and control of CO2 emissions in agricultural activities and includes the management of both tree and non-tree vegetation and soil in the emerged part of the lagoon.","

Project Description: VCS Version 4.1
saline characteristics of the water are the classic lagoon ones with saline increases during the summer
(40 ppt) and fresher water wedges during the winter (20 ppt). The other average chemical-physical
parameters are: Temp 5-28 °C, pH 8-8.5, O2 5-8 ppm. In the event of an overflow of the Sile River, flows
of fresher water can enter the valley and be used for the winter surface freezing of the fishponds. A
system of sluices allows the environment to be separated in the event of weather and climate adversity.
The maintenance of this equilibrium, which is indispensable for the development of a greenhouse gas
absorption effect, takes place by means of appropriate man-made changes of tidal seawater through
special mobile interface bulkhead locks.
Before the start of the project the valley was partially controlled with a traditional environmental
management. It was already practiced the conventional fish production.
The project is integrated into a human-controlled lagoon environment called the ‘fishing valley'. The
property is intended to ensure and improve the inflow of brackish water from the external environment
by favouring the maximum biological balance and biodiversity of the internal ecosystem. The presence of
mobile (closed) gates controlled by man, make it possible to control the quality of the water introduced,
excluding from the circuit (closed gates) external lagoon water with low oxygen content and rich in
metabolites/catabolites. Further actions are the continuous maintenance with the deepening of the inlet
channels that form the basis for proper environmental vivification. In addition, the natural presence of
nutrients (iron and nitrogenous substances) in the seabed favours the development of macro-algae that
capture carbon (CO2) from the atmosphere during the photosynthetic phase, organise it and transport it
to the seabed after their death during the cold season as described by Doimi M. (2021) : Human
Controlled Wetland Project for Carbon Capture and Storage in the Venetian Lagoon, Italy - Journal of
Environmental Science and Engineering A - Volume 10, Number 1. In addition, the proper management
of both tree and non-tree vegetation and soil in the emerged part will optimise the project.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
The project consists of assessing the production/absorption of greenhouse gas CO2 in a eutrophic lagoon
environment used for fishing purposes (Fishing Valley). According to the UNFCCC CDM criteria, this project
should be considered for the standard. VCS, AFOLU ARR project type and the voluntary assessment of
carbon credits based on Annex A of the Kyoto Protocol, which falls into the following category:

area excludes other vegetated areas within project boundary such as creeks, borders’ vegetation, and small spots of vegetation.
The H. brasiliensis plantations owned by the project participants are changing the socio-economic conditions of the region by
improving employment rates and incomes. Currently PICA, the project proponent, is seeking a financial solution that will allow
not only the expansion of its own plantations as well as the plantations of the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) but also to
allow doing good practices of responsible management within rubber plantations, that provide rubber to PICA’s industrial
plant, thereby increasing the amount of raw material available for processing.
The project aims to create a model of sustainable competitiveness in the natural rubber sector in Guatemala introducing
several innovative practices. The first will be to create a sustainable mechanism for project finance, introducing carbon finance
as a new and key financial tool to reach the required rate of return for investors in rubber plantations. The second innovation
will be to create a comprehensive tool-kit of methods and knowledge related to carbon project development, monitoring, and
management for new rubber tree plantations. The third innovation represents a milestone in sustainable management of
rubber tree plantations in Latin America, as the plantations established by the project will be certified under the Forest
Stewardship Council (FSC) principles and criteria.
FSC certification for the rubber tree plantations established by the project activity ensures that the project will comply with
stringent standards for social and environmental responsibility. In addition to generating emission reduction credits, the
plantations will serve as a buffer area for 675 hectares of the Cerro San Gil natural rainforest reserve in Izabal Department. As
required by FSC certification, new plantations added to the grouped project will not cause deforestation or degradation of
existing forests. Also, not only will the project create new employment opportunities for stakeholders, it will strive to protect
worker safety and rights while maintaining a good relationship with neighbouring communities.
PICA currently works with 350 rubber suppliers (plantation owners), most of them SMEs that are not participating in the
project. In accordance with PICA’s strategic plan, the knowledge and experience gained through the project will be replicated
with additional suppliers to expand the areas of their plantations.
1.5 Project location including geographic and physical information allowing the unique identification and delineation of
the specific extent of the project:

VCS Project Description - PICA
The farms situated in the North of Guatemala along the Atlantic Coast are located in the Departments of Izabal and Alta
Verapaz. The farms situated in the South of Guatemala along the Pacific Coast are located in the Department of Suchitepéquez.
The boundaries of the project have been defined and stored in a GIS environment.5 The coordinates of each farm are listed in
Table 1.
Regarding ownership of each farm, Guatemala has a Cadastral Registry which record legacy of farms and classified them under
data such as showed in Table 1 “No. of the Registered Legal Title”, this information is a unique record for each farm and a copy
of them is included in Annex F.
1.6 Duration of the project activity/crediting period:
The effective start date of the project is May 31, 2007. This is the date that the formal decision to commit financial resources
to the development of a carbon project to create an incentive for the establishment of natural rubber plantation was
documented and signed by the board of directors of PICA6, Project Proponent.
The crediting period runs from June 30, 2007 until 2049, total of crediting period 42 years. June 30, 2007 is the start date
marked by the implementation of the first project activity, which was the preparation of the soil for the establishment of the
first rubber plantations within the project boundary. The first trees were planted in 2007 and the final trees under the project
will be planted in 2013. The plantations’ rotation cycle for rubber tree is 36 years.
The VCS project crediting period and the carbon project lifetime is 42 years.
1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:

The project results in the achievement of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
specifically SDGs numbering 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 13, 15, 16 and 17.
SDG 1: No Poverty
Agriculture being one of major sectors of India’s economy, has been the source for survival and
income for a large proportion of India’s population. When farmers own lands which become
degraded due to non-cultivation, their incomes are affected as they are often mostly small and
marginal farmers and their lands are not productive enough. These farmers/land owners have
often only one source of income making them vulnerable to poverty in case of crop failure.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project carried out changes from a continuously flooded regime to an intermittently flooded
regime during rice cultivation in Chengmai County, Hainan Province, China, with a total acreage
of 12,488 ha of double-cropping rice. Without the project, there would be no ditches, pumps,
valves, and reservoirs to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously
flooded method would be continued. The original scenario for rice cultivation by the continuously
flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded
conditions can emit a large amount of methane because of anaerobic decomposition, the
intermittently flooded method is more conducive to saving water, increasing rice yield, and
reducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.
The implementation activities of the project include constructing high-standard farmland, annual
training, conducting the intermittently flooded method, etc. According to the needs of rice growth,
farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water
resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic
conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice
paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in
the rainy season. In this case, the methane emission can be declined by an average of 48%.
Hence, with the proposed project activity, the estimated GHG reduction from rice is 4.74
tCO e/ha. 2
The project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions by 414,337 tCO e in the first seven-year 2
period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 59,191 tCO e. The project aims to 2
reduce GHG and mitigate climate changes, increase rice productivity resulting in higher living
standards for local farmers and provide more job opportunities.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
This project is categorized as sectoral scope 14 (AFOLU) under Verra as justified in Section 1.3,
although the AMS-III.AU methodology applied is approved under sectoral scope 15 (Agriculture)
of CDM.
The project is developed under VCS scope 14 “Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)”
with an activity category of Improved Cropland Management (ICM) under Agricultural Land
Management (ALM).

1.3 Project Eligibility
Although the AMS-III.AU methodology applied is approved under sectoral scope 15 (Agriculture)
of CDM, this project is categorized as sectoral scope 14 (AFOLU) under Verra. This is by the
definitions of eligible AFOLU project categories set out in Appendix 1 of the VCS Standard, v4.2,
and can be demonstrated from the following three points.
According to Section 2.1.1 of “VCS Standard version 4.2”, this project activity meets two of the
scopes of the VCS program:
1) The six Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gases.
4) Project activities supported by a methodology approved under a VCS approved GHG
program unless explicitly excluded under the terms of Verra approval.
Accordingly, this project produces methane (CH ) emission reductions, which is one kind of the 4
six Kyoto Protocol GHGs. Besides, this project activity is supported by the CDM small-scale
methodology: Methane emission reduction by adjusted water management practice in rice
cultivation which is approved under a VCS approved GHG program – United Nations Clean
Development Mechanism and is not explicitly excluded under the terms of Verra approval.
Therefore, this project is eligible under the scope of the VCS program.

2 GENERAL
2.1 Project Goals, Design and Long-Term Viability
2.1.1 Summary Description of the Project (G1.2)
The Agropalma REDD+ Project is a partnership between Biofílica Ambipar Environmental and Agropalma
Group and its purpose is to promote forest conservation, maintenance of carbon stocks and mitigation of
climate change through the reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from land use change. In
addition to the climate benefits, the Project also intends to generate social benefits based on sustainable
economic development practices and improved well-being of the surrounding communities, as well as
environmental benefits through actions aimed at the conservation of local flora and fauna.
The Project area covers 50,519 hectares of Amazon forest and is located almost entirely in the northeastern
mesoregion of Pará State, including the municipalities of Tailândia, Moju, Tomé Açu and Acará. It is located
near the PA-150, an important highway for the distribution of the state's agricultural production, and on the
banks of the Acará River. We identified communities that are directly or indirectly influenced by the Project,
either because they supply labor to Fazenda Agropalma or because they are geographically close to the
Project Area and depend on its ecosystem services.
The region has great relevance in relation to its biodiversity, since it is located in the Belém Center of
Endemism (CEB), a place with a large concentration of rare and endemic species. The predominant
vegetation is Dense Ombrophylous Forest with a high density of medium and large trees, besides woody
lianas and epiphytes. It is home to at least 28 species of fauna and flora with some degree of threat
according to the IUCN Red List, some of which are endemic to the region.
It was identified that the main agents of deforestation and forest degradation in the region are small,
medium-sized family farmers or even large landowners. They are mostly rural producers who own areas in
agrarian reform settlements, squatters, and land grabbers who are in areas not yet recognized by the
agrarian reform or officially registered in the responsible public agencies and practice deforestation to
expand areas of agricultural and livestock production with low productivity or to search for raw material to
sustain the illegal trade in wood.
Based on this context, the Project's activities were designed to guarantee the conservation and protection
of biodiversity and natural resources, through mitigating and preventive measures such as the
strengthening of patrimonial vigilance, social inclusion and regional socioeconomic development through
alternative practices to deforestation, and the development and strengthening of value chains, the
establishment of a biodiversity conservation program, promoting in situ monitoring of the fauna and flora in
the Project Area, in addition to environmental education as a strategy to discourage predatory hunting and

According to Para 3.7.2 of Methodology requirements, the methodology shall establish
procedures to quantify all significant sources of leakage. Leakage is defined as an increase in
GHG emissions that occurs outside the project boundary (but within the same country) and is
measurable and attributable to the project activities. All leakage shall be accounted for in
accordance with Section 3.7. The two types of leakage are Arable farming and charcoal
production. To address such leakage the project has identified leakage management areas
located within the leakage belt. As part of the periodic monitoring process, such leakages if
occurring shall be quantified and reported. The Activity-shifting leakage occurs when the actual
agent of deforestation and/or forest or wetland degradation moves to an area outside of the
project boundary and continues its deforestation or degradation activities elsewhere. To
address such leakage the project has identified leakage management areas located within the

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The project changing from continuously flooded to intermittently flooded conditions during rice
cultivation is conducted Qing’an County, Suihua City, Heilongjiang Province, China, with a total
acreage of 17,513 ha of single-cropping rice. Without the project, there would be no ditches,
pumps, valves, and reservoirs to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional
continuously flooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was
cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Due to the anaerobic
decomposition of organic matter in the paddy soil under flooded conditions, a large amount of
methane can be released, so the intermittently flooded method is more conducive to saving water,
improving rice yield and reducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.
The implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir
construction, pumps and valves installation, training, etc. According to the needs of rice growth,
farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water
resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic
conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice
paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in
the rainy season. In this case, the methane emission can be declined by an average of 48%.
Hence, with the proposed project activity, the estimated GHG reduction from rice is 3.23
tCO2e/ha.
The project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions by 395,430 tCO2e in the first seven-year
period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 56,490 tCO2e. The project aims to
reduce GHG and mitigate climate changes, increase rice productivity resulting in higher living
standards for local farmers and provide more job opportunities.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
This project is categorized as sectoral scope 14 (AFOLU) under Verra as justified in Section 1.3,

VCS Project Description
1.12 Demonstration to confirm that the project was not
implemented to create GHG emissions primarily for the
purpose of its subsequent removal or destruction.
The project activity is a Greenfield project activity and
the natural choice for heat source for any other green
field project of this large scale would be to go for a new
coal based efficient technology, which is a common
industry practice as it assures a good return on
investment, due to the abundant availability of quality
coal in the nearby states at a cheaper rate.
However considering the emission reduction potential of a
renewable fuel, project proponent decided to opt for
biomass for thermal energy generation.
The Project proponent, hereby confirm that the project was
not implemented to create GHG emissions primarily for the
purpose of its subsequent removal or destruction.
1.13 Demonstration that the project has not created
another form of environmental credit (for example
renewable energy certificates).
The project activity doesn’t result in creation of any

A.2. Description of the project activity:
>>
CECIC Zhangbei Gaojialiang Wind farm Project (hereinafter referred to as the proposed project) is a
newly-built wind farm project, which is located in Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, and is developed by
CECIC Wind Power (Zhangbei) Yunwei Co. Ltd. As per the FSR, the calculations for the net supplier
power of the proposed project are carried out using professional WASP software (www.wasp.dk)
designed for wind energy. The output is maximised through selection of the most suitable turbines,
optimal turbine distribution in the wind farm, and considering the specific turbine characteristics, and the
grid connection. So the proposed project is to install and operate 66 wind turbines of 750kW and net
supplied power of 94,050 MWh per year will be exported to the North China Power Grid (NCPG) on the
basis of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).
As the baseline scenario, which is the same as the scenario existing prior to the implementation of the
project activity, comparable capacity or electricity generation addition provided by the NCPG, is
dominated by the thermal power generation, the operation of the proposed project will lead to emission
reductions of CO , which is estimated to be approximately 89,366 tonnes of CO e per year. The proposed 2 2
project will therefore help local government to promote the economy development and improve the air
quality.
The proposed project promotes local sustainable development through the following aspects:
• reducing CO , SO and NOx emissions; 2 2
• creating local employment opportunity during the assembly and installation of wind turbines, and
for operation of the proposed project;
• reducing other particulate pollutants resulting from the fossil fuel fired power plants compared with
a business-as-usual scenario.

replace the traditional cultivation method with an intermittently flooded method for GHG
reduction whilst contributing to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the project zone.
18,676 ha of rice paddies are changed to apply the intermittently flooded method in Fuling
District, where the rice used to be cultivated under continuously flooded conditions.
The project is in Fuling District. The total population of Fuling District is 1,115,016. All the rice
paddies belong to the farmers. During the construction period, Chongqing Municipal Agricultural
and Rural Affairs Committee (hereinafter “agricultural authority”) was the main manager, with
the cooperation and participation of Gengfang, of the construction of ditches and reservoirs,
while the local farmers were hired to build the ditches and reservoirs. During the operation period,
Gengfang is responsible for supervising technicians to patrol and maintain the ditches and
reservoirs. Besides, Gengfang has been fully authorized by all the farmers to act as the project
proponent, who oversees the project development and management, including compiling the
Monitoring and Quality Control Manual, organizing the training, etc. Moreover, the local
agricultural authority is responsible for technical training. Farmers are the main operators to
practice intermittently flooded water regimes and are supposed to record the cultivation
logbooks. The technicians should carry out monthly inspections according to the Monitoring and
Quality Control Manual requirements. The profit from this carbon reduction project is shared with
farmers.
The implementation of the project activity generates 59,243 tCO e per year and contributes to 3 2

A total of 8,645 households (36,136 farmers) were involved in the project. Without the project, local villagers would not have access to intermittently flooded technology and intact facilities to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously flooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Due to the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in the paddy soil under flooded conditions, a large amount of methane can be released, so the intermittently flooded method is more conducive to water efficiency, improving rice yield and reducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.\r\nThe implementation activities of the project include promoting intermittently flooded technology, technical training for the farmers, facility repair and replacement, etc. According to the needs of rice growth, farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in the rainy season.\r\nThe project is expected to reduce GHG emissions by 414,701 tCO2e in the first seven-year period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 59,243 tCO2e.

2 DESIGN
2.1 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
This project is an Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) project under the Reduced
Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) project category. Specifically, the project is of
the “Avoiding unplanned deforestation and degradation” (AUD) type. This project is not a grouped
project.
The project is only claiming credits generated from avoided unplanned deforestation. This is a
conservative approach since the planned activities should also avoid the risk of future planned
deforestation and avoid any future worsening of degradation (currently occurring at negligible levels
from the perspective of GHG emissions).
Increased carbon sequestration from reforestation or assisted natural regeneration is not a major
objective of the project. Some of the forest areas where deforestation is prevented may increase in
carbon stock naturally due to recovery from past logging, and in theory this might be eligible for
additional credits, but to reduce project complexity no credits will be claimed for this during the first
fixed baseline period.
2.2 Description of the Project Activity (G3)
Objectives and conceptual model
The objectives of the REDD project in the Core Area link directly to the over-arching management
objectives of the SPF. The original vision for the SPF was developed at a multi-stakeholder workshop
in July 2006 (WCS/FA 2006b). This consultation included representatives from all the relevant
government agencies, local government, village leaders and civil society. The agreed Vision for the
site was: A well-managed forest landscape that supports increasing wildlife populations and improving
livelihoods for the people who currently live there. At the same meeting a general conceptual model
for the project was developed, linking the goal to four key measurable targets, a set of direct and
indirect threats and a set of interventions. This was then used to develop the first three year strategic
plan, 2008-2011, the annual workplans and the draft Subdecree.
Figure 2.1 shows the current conceptual model, based on the 2006 results, which was revised and
updated slightly during the design of the REDD project based on the analysis of threats set out in
Section 4.5.
Subdecree 143 (2009) lists nine management objectives for SPF, which map closely to the four high
level Targets in the conceptual model. These are listed below in relation to the three CCBA themes -
climate, community and biodiversity. The activities are then discussed in more detail.
Climate objectives
The SPF Subdecree contains the following two relevant objectives.
3- To contribute to protection and conservation, to meet the goals of the National Millennium
Development Plan of the Royal Government of Cambodia, and to maintain forest cover;
7- To maintain carbon stored in vegetation in order to reduce carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions into the 2
atmosphere;
The target in the revised conceptual model is: 'Maintain the variety, integrity and extent of all forest
types'
Community objectives
The SPF Subdecree contains the following four relevant objectives.

1.12 Project Location
The grouped project is located in Spain. All planting sites have the same baseline scenario and are
identified and classified as degraded land by combining soil mapping with visual assessments (see
section 1.13). Remote sensing analysis is conducted on all of the sites to determine existing
forests/trees/canopy cover, with most cases using multiple drone flights. On sites with pre-exisiting
trees, the vegetation is left undisturbed and are cropped out of the designated project area, creating
a very detailed KML file. Each project instance is defined using their exact location, delineated by the
polygons layered on the maps presented below.

1.13 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
The baseline scenario is the same as the conditions existing prior to the project initiation. The
description of the scenario is explained in Section 3.4. Therefore, the prior conditions are not
repeated in this section.
This section focuses on the conditions generated by the temperate climatic conditions that
characterise the areas within which the first instances of the project are located, as well as the
historic human-induced influence on the land. All land has reached a certain level of degradation and
would not have been restored without intervention, as shown in part 1.13.3 of this section. Analyses
of conditions prior to project initiation are largely supported by Land Life’s Remote Sensing
Dashboard (RSD).

This area is owned by the Commonwealth of Virginia, under authority of the VA Department of Environmental Quality. The VCR Seagrass Restoration Project, initiated in 2015, involves the restoration of seagrass meadows at the VCR through direct seeding. Seagrass meadows remained absent from the coastal bays of the VCR until the late 1990s. In 1999, TNC and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) began a large-scale eelgrass restoration effort at the VCR. By the project start date in 2015 eelgrass restoration efforts had already maximized natural recruitment, and continued seed additions were necessary to further increase eelgrass extent across the VCR coastal bays. Data collected at restoration plots established by direct seeding revealed a larger habitable area than the natural recruit distribution, indicating that eelgrass extent could reach up to 107 square kilometers with continued seed additions. Direct seeding of restoration plots will continue in the carbon project to further expand seagrass coverage. The University of Virginia (UVA) and VIMS have studied the seagrass restoration effort at the VCR since its inception, increasing understanding of the long-term effects of expanding eelgrass coverage at the VCR and the potential role for seagrass meadows in mitigating climate change. Seagrass restoration directly increases carbon storage in submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and marine sediments, enhancing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission removals from the atmosphere.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
Côte d’Ivoire has experienced dramatic deforestation for the last decades: forest area decreased from
16 Mha in 1960 to 2.9 Mha in 2021. Deforestation is driven first by slash-and-burn agriculture for both
food and cash crops by smallholders.
To address this issue, the Government of Côte d’Ivoire adopted in 2019 a Strategy for the Preservation,
Rehabilitation and Extension of Forests (SPREF) that opened, notably, the involvement of the private
sector in the management of gazetted forests through concession instruments. The current project falls
under this framework, specifically in the “Forêt Classée du Haut-Sassandra” (FCHS), in center west of
Côte d’Ivoire.
15 years ago, the 104,000 ha of Haut-Sassandra forest were still covered by a magnificent semi-
deciduous forest. As of today, 95% of its surface has been deforested and is now under illegal cocoa
plantations and fallows.
aDryada (a French development company specialized in nature-based solutions and biodiversity
conservation) and its Ivorian partner, Agromap, signed an agreement with the Ministry of Water and
Forest for the rehabilitation of the FCHS. A 40-year concession agreement is currently being negotiated.
The project aim is the permanent reestablishment of a largely natural and largely intact forest over
70,000 ha of the FCHS. The main activities to be implemented are: 1/ plantation of a very diversified mix
of native species in both fallow and cocoa parcels and 2/ Assisted natural regeneration in remaining
degraded forests. As the main goal is to reestablish a natural forest and its biodiversity, no harvesting
activities are envisaged. The project is expected to generate significant GHG removals of c. 36.8 MtCO2e
over the crediting period and an annual average of c. 890 ktCO2e.
Agroforestry schemes are implemented in the remaining 34,000 ha as well as around the FCHS to ensure
sources of sustainable livelihoods to local populations, contributing to the long-term success of the
project.
Karidja project includes an important package to support sustainable economic transition, social
infrastructures improvement and trainings to provide long term social co-benefits to local communities.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
Sectoral Scope: 14. Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)

"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology of this project, referred to as AR_AMS0007, involves the planting of diverse species of trees and shrubs on multiple parcels of land. The baseline scenario is the continuation of the pre-project land use, which in this case was barren lands with no forest cover. The project aims to demonstrate additionality, meaning that the project activity would not have occurred anyway due to certain barriers.

To demonstrate additionality, the project proponents can either use the barrier analysis outline contained in Appendix 1 of the methodology or an approved standardized baseline applicable to their project. In this case, the project makes use of the analysis outline in Appendix 1.

The project activities involve planting activities carried out by grassroots organizations with experience in tree planting and a close relationship with local communities. The species of trees and shrubs selected are determined by stakeholders and implementation partners, considering the suitability for each location and the desired planting composition. The project faces technical barriers, such as lack of access to planting material and the expertise required for planning and managing the planting design.

The saplings for all the selected species are sourced from private nurseries, requiring a significant investment. The project includes various stakeholders or landowners across multiple locations, and there is no funding available for such planting activities, leading to investment barriers.

Based on the presence of both investment and technological barriers, the project is considered additional.

There are no deviations from the methodology outlined in AR_AMS0007 for this project.

Regarding the quantification of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions and removals, baseline emissions are calculated using Equation 1 as specified in Section 5.4, paragraph 17 of the methodology. However, the specific details of Equation 1 are not provided in the given context.","

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
Following Section 5.2, paragraph 14, of the methodology AR_AMS0007, the baseline scenario
is the continuation of the pre-project land use. The plantation site or plots prior to the start of
the project were barren lands, with no forest cover and would have remained as such in the
absence of the project.
3.5 Additionality
As per section 5.2, para 15 of the methodology the Project Proponents (PPs) shall demonstrate
that the project activity is additional by selecting one of the following options:
(a) Using the barrier analysis outline contained in appendix 1 of the methodology; or
(b) Using an approved standardized baseline applicable to their project.
The project makes use of the analysis outline in Appendix 1 of the methodology
Project Proponents (PPs) shall demonstrate that the project activity would not have occurred
anyway due to at least one of the following barriers.
The project activities comprise planting of diverse species of trees and shrubs on multiple
discrete parcels of land. The planting activities are undertaken through several grassroots
organisations with experience in tree planting, and a close relationship with the local
communities. The species selected are selected by the stakeholders and with the expertise of
the implementation partners. The mix and diversity of species used in the project require
technical expertise to assess suitable species for each location and the right planting
composition. Hence the project faces technical barriers including lack of access to planting
material in addition to the expertise required to planning and managing the planting design.
The saplings for all the species selected are sourced from private nurseries. This requires a
significant investment. The project species comprise of forest, fruit, medicinal and other
species and there is no profit to the PP due to project implantation. In addition, the project has
multiple stakeholders or landowners, spread across several locations. There is no funding
available for such types of planting activity, and hence the project faces investment barriers.
‘Therefore the project faces investment and technological barriers and is deemed additional.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
Core CarbonX Solutions Private Limited (CCX) is a carbon management consultancy company with
registered office in the state of Telangana. CCX is the Project Proponent (PP) of the carbon offset project
called “Ban Odisha01” in all districts of Odisha. The carbon credit rights is transferred to CCX which in
turn will share the carbon revenue to farmers on realisation of carbon credits. The individual farmers are
the owners of the lands on which trees are being grown to sequester carbon and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions from the atmosphere. CCX has mobilized the farmers in the selected states of India to plant
various tree species on their lands. These tree species range from fruit bearing trees like Indian
blackberry, Guava, Mango, lemon to commercial species like cashew, arjuna, asana, teak, mahogany,
etc. Simple tree cultivation techniques involving planting saplings in the pits with minimum disturbance
to the lands have been employed by the selected farmers.
The villages under the project area predominantly have an agrarian economy where most of its population
depends on agriculture. The condition prior to the project initiation was barren land or agriculture as
maize, chili, pulses and paddy or other commercial crops were grown by the farmers on their farmlands
with limited agroforestry species. The planation was done by the farmers and utilized the subsidies to
avail the saplings. The saplings do the sequestration of carbon dioxide at faster pace and ultimately
reduces GHG emissions.
The Project Activity will lead to considerable carbon sequestration in the project areas and will contribute
strongly to the sustainable development of rural villages involved in the project.
The project quantifies the GHG removals occurring from agroforestry plantations through the use of AR-
ACM0003: “Afforestation and reforestation project activities implemented on lands other than wetlands”,
Version 02.0 developed under the Clean Development Mechanism for large-scale plantations. The project
plans to generate carbon credits for the voluntary market under the VCS standard. Such planting activity
would result in carbon credits that would be sold in the carbon market to generate revenue. As per the
Carbon-offset agreement entered into between the farmers and CCX, 60%-80 of the carbon income
generated from the sale of carbon credits would be distributed among the farmers. The project activity
was implemented in 1900 hectares. Through carbon sequestration by the planted trees, the project is
expected to generate annual average GHG emission reductions or removals of 15671 tCO2e.
The selected farmers are those farmers who did not plant anything on their lands as they were fallow
lands. CCX company held workshops in the villages and advised the villagers to grow certain types of fruit
and commercial trees in a sustainable manner to earn carbon revenue. The idea of earning additional
revenue caught the farmers attention and they decided to enter into carbon-offset agreements with the
CCX company.

"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology of this project is based on the following tools and guidelines:

1. Tool 01: This tool is used for the demonstration and assessment of additionality. It provides a general framework for demonstrating and assessing the additionality of a wide range of project types.

2. Tool 7: This tool is used to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system. It is applied when calculating baseline emissions for a project activity that substitutes grid electricity.

3. Tool 11: This tool is used to assess the validity of the original/current baseline and update the baseline at the renewal of the crediting period. It is used to determine the emission factors for the baseline scenario.

The project, Uluabat HEPP, meets the applicability criteria of ACM0002, which is applicable to grid-connected renewable energy power generation projects. The project involves the installation of a new grid-connected renewable electricity generation project and results in the formation of a new reservoir with a power density greater than 4 W/m2.

The project also applies the applicability conditions of Tool 7 and Tool 01. Tool 7 is used to calculate baseline emissions for the project activity that substitutes grid electricity, which is the case for Uluabat HEPP. Tool 01 is used for the demonstration and assessment of additionality, and it is considered applicable for this project.

Furthermore, Tool 11 is referred to for the changes required in the methodology implementation and baseline scenario in the second and third crediting periods. The project participants are advised to refer to Tool 11 for the updated emission factors.

The project boundary is defined as the installation of a Greenfield power plant, and the baseline scenario is based on the electricity that would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and the addition of new generation sources. The emission sources included in the project boundary are identified based on the combined margin (CM) calculations described in Tool 7.

Uluabat HEPP is connected to the Turkish National Grid through Görükle-Akçalar Substation, using an 11-kilometer-long transmission line.","

Project Description: VCS Version 4.1
• “Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality,” Version 5.2 (referred to as “Tool
01” from here on,13
• “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system,” Version 07 (referred to as “Tool
7” from here on), as well as with the,
• “Assessment of the validity of the original/current baseline and update of the baseline at the
renewal of the crediting period,” Version 03.0.1 (referred to as “Tool 11” from here on)
3.2 Applicability of Methodology
The “Applicability” Section in ACM0002 states:
“This methodology is applicable to grid connected renewable energy power generation project activities
that (a) install a Greenfield power plant […] [...] The methodology is applicable under the following
conditions:
• The project activity may include renewable energy power plant/unit of one of the following
types: hydropower plant/unit with or without reservoir, […]
• In case of hydropower plants, one of the following conditions shall apply: […] The project
activity is implemented in existing single or multiple reservoirs, where the volume of the
reservoir(s) is increased and the power density […] is greater than 4 W/m2 […].”14
Uluabat HEPP meets all these criteria and conditions. The project;
• Involves the installation of a new grid connected renewable electricity generation project,
• Does not involve switching from fossil fuel use to renewable energy at the site of the project
activity,
• Results in the formation of a new reservoir whose power density is higher than 4 W/m2, as
demonstrated in Section 4.2 below.
Moreover, ACM0002 explicitly requires applying the applicability conditions of the Tool 7 and Tool 01. The
Section “Scope and applicability” in the Tool 7 states: “[…] This tool may be applied […] when calculating
baseline emissions for a project activity that substitutes grid electricity that is where a project activity
supplies electricity to a grid [..].”15 This is the case for Uluabat HEPP.
In Tool 01, the Section “Scope and applicability” states: “[…] The document provides a general framework
for demonstrating and assessing additionality and is applicable to a wide range of project types. […]”16
As the project type of Uluabat HEPP is per ACM0002, and at the same time ACM0002 refers to the Tool
01, the latter can be considered as applicable.
13 The project’s additionality was demonstrated using Tool 01 V.5.2 during the initial validation.

Project Description: VCS Version 4.1
Regarding changes required for methodology implementation and baseline scenario in the second and
third crediting periods, ACM0002 suggests project participants refer to the Tool 11.17 This article is also
valid for Uluabat HEPP as the BM, OM, and CM emission factors have changed. The previous BM, OM,
and CM factors were calculated from scratch. This report has seen no need for such calculations since
Turkey’s Energy and Natural Sources Ministry started to issue factsheets for the value of the said factors
in recent years.
3.3 Project Boundary
ACM0002 prescribes the baseline scenario for projects being “[…] installation of a Greenfield power
plant[…]” as follows:
“Electricity delivered to the grid by the projects activity would have otherwise been generated by the
operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as reflected in
the combined margin (CM) calculations described in ‘TOOL07: Tool to calculate the emission factor for an
electricity system’.”18
This baseline scenario applies because Uluabat HEPP is a new grid-connected power plant. Consequently,
ACM0002 provisions about identifying GHG sources – included in the project boundary and used in the
calculation of emission reduction by the project activity – are given in the table below.
Table 3. Emission sources included or excluded from the project boundary
Uluabat HEPP is connected to the Turkish National Grid through Görükle-Akçalar Substation,
through an 11-kilometer-long line that has been built using the same route with the existing
transmission line and poles. The below figure provides the plant’s grid connection diagram.

an Improved Cropland Management (ICM) project. This is a grouped project.
1.3 Project Eligibility
The CIBO Initiative for Scaling Regenerative Agriculture meetstherequirementslaidoutintheVCS
Standard for AFOLU projects (Section 3.2) as follows:
Project activities do not occur on land converted from nativeecosystemsinthe10yearspriortothe
project start date, nor will project activities convert native ecosystems to generate GHG credits.
CIBO has ensured that these applicability conditions are met through its enrollment process by
requiring farmer attestation and verifying this attestation by comparing GIS files of enrolled field
boundaries against remotely sensed datasets such as the United States National Agricultural
Statistics Service (NASS) Cropscape and Cropland Data Layer (CDL)1 to confirm that participating
lands are currently cropland and have not recently been converted fromnativeecosystems.Project
activities do not occur on wetlands, drain native ecosystems, nor degrade hydrological function.
Participating growers will continue to follow all applicable local, state, and federal regulation on
wetlands and waterways, and project activities are expected to be neutral or beneficial to field
hydrology and local water quality. Lastly, CIBO will demonstrate that project activities resulting in
GHG benefits have been implementedandmaintainedduringeachverificationperiodinaccordance
with the steps outlined in Section 5 of this project description.
VCS Standard AFOLU requirements regarding jurisdictional REDD+ programs (VCS Standard
Section 3.2.2) are not applicable since this is not a REDD+ project. Likewise, VCS guidance on
implementation partners acting in partnership with the project proponent (VCS Standard Section
3.2.3) is not applicable since CIBO is the sole project proponent and implementation entity.
1.4 Project Design

"What are the methodologies of this project?","The methodology of this project involves information collection and management, as well as monitoring and verification of data. The project owner is responsible for providing necessary information and data for validation and verification. All monitoring data is recorded and kept under the safe custody of the power plant site manager. The measurement of production data is controlled and stored in an identified management department.

Any changes within the project boundary, such as changes in spare or equipment, are recorded, and any change in emission reduction due to such alterations is studied and documented. Physical documents are stored by the project owner, and a copy is kept to facilitate verification by the Designated Operational Entity (DOE). A reliable and well-tested software control system is used to manage data and information collection and recording, with the aim of clear and easy operation of the wind farm without extensive computer skills required.

The power supplied to the grid, invoices, relevant accounting documents, billing receipts, and calibration results are collected in a central place by the project owner. Data records are archived for a period of 2 years after the crediting period to which the records pertain.

In case of damaged metering equipment, the project owner follows specific procedures for estimating net supply to the grid. If the main meter is damaged, the backup meter is read. If both the main meter and backup meter are damaged, the project owner and the grid company jointly calculate a conservative estimate of power supplied to the grid according to the Power Purchase Agreement. A statement is prepared, signed by both parties, indicating the background to the damage, the assumptions used for estimating net supply, and the efforts taken to restore normal monitoring procedures.

The project owner is required to prepare an annual monitoring report, which includes a summary of daily operations, metering values of power supplied to and received from the grid, copies of sales/billing receipts, a report on calibration, and a calculation of emission reductions.

The baseline study and monitoring methodology for this project were completed on 08/08/2008. The responsible person for determining the baseline study and monitoring methodology is Feng Shijun, a consultant at the Hebei CDM Project Office.

The project activity started on 06/06/2007 (construction date), and the expected operational lifetime of the project activity is 20 years.

The choice of the crediting period is a renewable crediting period. The starting date of the first crediting period is 10/10/2008 or the date of registration in the Executive Board (EB), whichever is later. The length of the first crediting period is 7 years. There is no fixed crediting period mentioned in the project documentation.","

Project Description: VCS Version 4.1
the local farmers were hired to build the ditches and reservoirs. During the operation period,
Harbin Huanyu is responsible for supervising technicians to patrol and maintain the ditches
and reservoirs. Furthermore, as the owner of the rice paddies, these farmers have right to
authorize Harbin Huanyu as a representative of the carbon project owner and Harbin Huanyu
only has the right to make decisions about the carbon reduction project.3 Search Co2 was
appointed by Harbin Huanyu as the developer of rice emission reduction project. Therefore,
Search Co2 has played two roles in developing carbon reduction project.
Firstly, Search Co2 is the consultant which is responsible for helping the project proponent
with development and management of the carbon project, including compiling the
monitoring plan, organizing the training, etc. Secondly, Search Co2 is the purchaser, so it
has right of speech for marketing. Although Harbin Huanyu has already sold the carbon
emission reduction generated by this project to Search Co2, it does not affect Harbin
Huanyu rights and obligations as the project proponent.
1.8 Project Start Date
According to VCS standard, the project start date is the date on which activities that lead to
the generation of GHG emission reductions or removals are implemented (e.g., preparing
land for seeding, planting, changing agricultural or forestry practices, rewetting, restoring
hydrological functions, or implementing management or protection plans). For this project,
according to the requirements of the AMS-III.AU methodology applied, an entire cropping
season is started from land preparation and the emission reduction calculation is also
started this day. So, the project start date is 11-May-20184 when the land preparation was
started.
1.9 Project Crediting Period
The crediting period of this project will be using a 7-year, twice renewable crediting period,
for a combined total project crediting period of 21 years from 11-May-2018 to 10-May-2039,
and the project lifetime is 30 years5 from 11-April-20186 to 10-April-2048.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The Inner Mongolia Yitulihe-Genhe Afforestation Project (hereafter “the project”) is located in northern
part of the western side of Greater Khingan Mountains, Hulun Buir City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region, P.R.C. The project is jointly implemented byInner Mongolia Yitulihe Forestry Co. LTD and Genhe
Forest Industry Co. LTD, both of which belong to the China Inner Mongolia Forest Industry Group. The
project is designed to establish forests on degraded lands previously deforested and/or converted
(croplands or settlements).
Most of the lands to be planted were deforested since 1950s. Significant deforested lands were
converted to croplands and settlements to support livelihood for increased residents. Other land
remained as barren lands and have never been reforested since then. Due to human disturbance,
desertification and sandification as well as soil erosion, the barren lands are degraded and degrading
which would continue under the without project scenario.
2,059.4 ha of forest is to be established by direct planting on degraded lands in 12 forestry farm of
Yitulihe Forestry Bureau and 12 forestry farms of Genhe Forestry Bureau. 66.3%% of reforestation
activities are carried out in a mixture of different tree species for a purpose of enhancing resilience.
Major species and Afforestation models include 480.64 ha of Spruce (Picea meyeri Rehd.et Wils),
214.6 ha of Mongolian Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica Litv.), 546.0 ha of mixture of spruce
and larch (Larix gmelinii (Rupr.) Kuzen), 43.8 ha of mixture of spruce, Scotch pine and elm (Ulmus
macrocarpa Hance), 187.2 ha of spruce and elm, 459.9 ha of mixture of spruce and Scotch pine, and
127.3 ha of mixture of Mongolian Scotch pine and elm. It is expected that the project would produce
800,326 tCO e of GHG removals in 60 years, with an average annual GHG removals of 13,339 tCO e, 2 2
starting in 2020. All species are native. No invasive alien species or genetically modified organisms are
involved. All lands within the project boundary are state-owned.
The project proponents and participants hold a view that the project, through the above-mentioned
activities, would contribute to environment improvement (biodiversity conservation and soil erosion
control), thus contribute to sustainable development, specifically,
- Sequester GHGs and mitigate climate change and enhance climate adaptation;
- control soil and water erosion and land degradation/desertification in the selected project areas;
- enhance biodiversity conservation by increasing forest cover and nature habitat connectivity;
- generate income for the project participants and local community.

"What are the methodologies of this project?","Based on the provided context, the methodology of this project involves several steps:

1. Calculation of factor F: The project calculates the factor F, which represents the share of similar projects (penetration diff all rate of the measure/technology) using a measure/technology similar to the measure/technology used in the proposed project activity that deliver the same output or capacity as the proposed project activity. The formula to calculate F is F = 1 - N / N, where N is the number of similar projects.

2. Evaluation of factor F: The project compares the calculated value of F with a threshold value of 0.2. If F is greater than 0.2, it indicates that the proposed project activity is a common practice within the sector in the applicable geographical area.

3. Evaluation of N - N: The project evaluates the difference between N and N (N - N). If N - N is greater than 3, it also indicates that the proposed project activity is a common practice within the sector in the applicable geographical area.

4. Determination of common practice: Based on the evaluations of F and N - N, the project determines whether the proposed project activity is a common practice within the sector in the applicable geographical area.

5. Methodology deviations: The project states that no methodology deviation is applied in the project.

6. Estimation of baseline emissions: The project calculates the baseline emissions in accordance with ACM0001 ""Flaring or Use of Landfill Gas"" Version 19.0. The baseline emissions include methane emissions from Solid Waste Disposal Sites (SWDS) and electricity generation using fossil fuels or supplied by the grid.

It is important to note that the methodology described above is specific to the provided context and may not be applicable to other projects or situations.","

Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.1
N = 0 diff
Step (5): Calculate factor F= 1 - N /N representing the share of similar projects (penetration diff all
rate of the measure/technology) using a measure/technology similar to the measure/technology
used in the proposed project activity that deliver the same output or capacity as the proposed
project activity.
Calculate
F= 1 – N / N all diff
F= 1
So, F is greater than 0.2
N - N = 0 all diff
So, N - N is not greater than 3. all diff
As per the Tool for common practice analysis, version 03.1, the proposed project activity is a
common practice within a sector in the applicable geographical area if both the following
conditions are fulfilled:
(a) the factor F is greater than 0.2, and
(b) N - N is greater than 3. all diff
Since for the proposed project activity the value of N – N is 0 which is not greater than 3, the all diff
project activity is not a “common practice” within sector in the applicable geographical area.
3.6 Methodology Deviations
No methodology deviation is applied in the project.
4 ESTIMATED GHG EMISSION
REDUCTIONS AND REMOVALS
4.1 Baseline Emissions
In accordance with ACM0001 “Flaring or Use of Landfill Gas” Version 19.0, baseline emissions
should comprise the following sources:
A) Methane emissions from the SWDS in the absence of the project activity;
B) Electricity generation using fossil fuels or supplied by the grid in the absence of
project activity;
C) Heat generation using fossil fuels in the absence of project activity; and
D) Natural gas used from the natural gas network in the absence of the project activity.
Since there are no heat generations or natural gas usage in the baseline scenario, only baseline
emissions from methane emissions from SWDS (A) and electricity generation (B) will be taken
into account. The baseline emissions are calculated as follows:

Version: 5.0
Date: 19/09/ 2010
A.2. Description of the project activity:
Inner Mongolia Chifeng Gaofeng Wind Power Project (hereafter referred to as the proposed project) is a
grid connected renewable energy project developed by Chifeng Xinsheng Wind Power Co. Ltd. The
proposed project located in Songshan District, Chifeng City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China.
The proposed project involves the installation of 25 wind turbines (Vestas V80-2000kW of Denmark),
each of which has the capacity of 2000kW, for a total installed capacity of 50MW. The purpose of the
proposed project is to generate electricity using wind power resources in the project region and to sell into
and replace the same amount of power generation in Northeast Power Grid (NEPG) which is dominated
by the fossil fuel fired power plants, as identified both the baseline scenario and the scenario existing
prior to the start of the implementation of the proposed project activity which is that electricity delivered
to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected
power plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as reflected in the combined margin (CM)
calculations described in the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system”.
It is estimated that the electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity will be 131,700MWh, and as
a result, 150,915 tonnes of CO2 emission reductions will be generated annually.
The contributions of the proposed project to sustainable development goal are summarized as follows:
 Being located in a power grid dominated by fossil fuel fired power plants, development of the
proposed project will not only reduce GHG emissions but also mitigate local environmental
pollution caused by air emissions from fossil fuel fired power plants;
 New jobs will be generated during the operation periods;
 Development of the proposed project could contribute to meeting local electricity demand and
increase employment opportunities, then boost the economy in the local region.

1.13 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
Prior to the project initiation, economic conditions in the project area are not very good and
the level of education is relatively low8, so farmers lacked advanced irrigation technologies,
such as the intermittent flooded water regime. However, intermittent flooded water regime
requires that irrigation and drainage can be controlled according to the growth needs of
rice during its cultivation. Whereas, the low economic level leads to the low income of
farmers, which means that farmers have no additional economic capacity to afford the
construction of the branch ditches which can practice controllable irrigation and drainage.
To improve the infrastructure conditions of agricultural production, increase food
production, and promote sustainable agriculture, the project was implemented. Therefore,
the project was not implemented to generate GHG emissions for the purpose of their
subsequent reduction, removal, or destruction.
Since the conditions existing prior to the project initiation is the same as baseline scenario,
please refer to Section 3.4 (Baseline Scenario) to see the detail information. Besides, this
project does not affect the environmental conditions, including climate, hydrology,
topography, soils, relevant historical conditions, type of vegetation, ecosystems, etc., so,
the present and prior environmental conditions of this project are the same, which are
listed as follows.

Without the implementation of this project, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\r\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 3.63 tCO2e/ha for single-cropping rice is expected.

The two monitoring plans are :
AMS-III.D Methane Recovery
The simplified monitoring methodologies are going to be applied to determine and record the methane emissions
caused by the manure that will be captured and destroyed by the project activity and otherwise would have been
released into the atmosphere.
The amount of methane used as fuel for combustion or flared is going to be monitored, using a flow meter
respectively an hour counter and analysing the methane content of the burned gases. Not only the amount of manure,
but also the amounts and quality of co-ferments is monitored. The share of methane gas production resulting from
fermentation of the manure and from the co-ferments derived from wastes can thus be determined from 2 ways. It is
either calculated from the amount of manure and waste co-ferments used, or calculated from the total produced
amount of biogas minus the calculated theoretical methane production from the other co-ferments.
In operation year 1 the flow meter is only measuring the volume flow, but not calibrated to standard conditions. Thus
for the first year of operation the amount of biogas burned cannot be exactly measured, but will have to be re-

MONITORING REPORT : VCS Version 3
1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Implementation Status of the Project
The International Small Group and Tree Planting Program (TIST) empowers Small Groups of
subsistence farmers in Kenya, Uganda, India and Tanzania to combat the devastating effects of
deforestation, poverty and drought. Combining sustainable development with carbon
sequestration, TIST supports the reforestation and biodiversity efforts of about 87,000
subsistence farmers. Carbon credit sales generate participant income and provide project
funding to address agricultural, HIV/AIDS, nutritional and fuel challenges. As TIST expands to
more groups and more areas, it ensures more trees, more biodiversity, more climate change
benefit and more income for more people.
Since its inception in 1999, TIST participants organized into over 12,000 TIST Small Groups have
planted over 18 million trees on their own and community lands. GhG sequestration is creating a
long-term income stream and developing sustainable environments and livelihoods. TIST in
Uganda began in 2003 and has grown to about 14,500 TIST participants in about 2,200 Small
Groups.
UG PD-VCS-001 is a grouped AFOLU project, eligible under the Afforestation, Reforestation and
Revegetation (ARR) category. It is a subset of the TIST project in Uganda and initially applied to
291 of the Small Groups, 1,662 members, 1,000 project areas and 777 ha. The PD was
validated and first verified on 20 March 2012 by Environmental Services, Inc. (ESI).
UG-VCS-001 was verified a second time 27 October 2014 by JACO CDM. The verification period
was 07 October 11 to 31 December 2013. The monitoring report demonstrated 799 project
areas, 700 ha and 833,038 trees.
This is the third verification of UG-VCS-001 and was conducted by EPIC Sustainability. The
verification period was 01 January 2014 to 17 April 2019. The monitoring demonstrated 463
project areas, 546 ha and 465,654 trees.
The following is the verification history, including the total GHG removals generated in this
monitoring period
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
This project is registered under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS 3.7) as an Afforestation,
Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR) project and has been developed in compliance with the

The estimated total emission reductions (ERs) over 10 year crediting period are 288,290 tCO . 2e
1.8 Description of the Project Activity
Technologies Implemented
The project involves installation and operation of a rice husk based boiler employing a new
technology based on the moving chain conveyor concept. The technology comprises a natural
circulation steam boiler with 5% continuous rate of blow-down. The treated water is heated to
reach its saturated temperature of 105°C in an economizer utilizing the return condensate and
hot flue gases (at about 160°C).
Inside the combustion chamber in the boiler, the rice husks are mixed with air at an inlet
temperature of 170°C. The rice husks are kept in suspension using circulating fluidized bed
mechanism by use of blowers at the bottom and induction fans at the top of the boiler. This
feeding system increases the overall boiler efficiency compared to normal feeding system which
is a fuel efficient feature in this technology. In order to control the quality of the rice husk ash,
temperature inside the boilers need to be maintained at 450°C-650°C. This is achieved through
the design of internal inclined reciprocating grate which allows the ash to cool down prior to
entering the ash collection system at the bottom of the boiler. Figure 1 summarises the
conceptual configuration of the overall system.

1.1 Summary Description of the Project
This project will protect the Bolivian Amazon forest from planned deforestation, initially protecting
235 has of tropical rain forest. The methodology implemented is:
• VM0007 REDD Methodology Framework but limited to the planned deforestation
activities (module VMD0006 (BL-PL) as well as other modules listed in section 2.1
below)
Protection of the project areas under this methodology will prevent the emissions from
deforestation and conversion to pastures and allow the forest to reclaim its status as a primary
forest.
The project is a grouped project and the instances must be located in the only geographic area
defined by the union of the Departments of Pando or Beni in Bolivia. The instances must be
under threat of planned deforestation for conversion to agricultural activities as defined under
VM0007 at the time the project proponent took ownership of the project area.
The project starts with only one instance but this number is expected to grow with time. The
instance is located in the department of Beni, 150 km south of Riberalta and forms part of the
Bolivian Amazon Forest. The project area is home to species listed in the red book as vulnerable
and endangered such as Cedrela Odorata: Bertholletia excelsa, Amburana cearencis. The project
are has suffered in the past to some degree or other from selective logging, deforestation for
agricultural purposes and deforestation resulting from human induced fires.
In protecting the forest, the project will pay special attention to endangered and vulnerable tree
species native to the region while ensuring that the communities surrounding the project areas do
not suffer the full impact of job losses associated with forest preservation. In addition to
protecting the forests in the project areas, the project will enrich the project areas with
endangered and vulnerable tree species. The prevention of deforestation will lead to the loss of
employment opportunities. This will be partly mitigated by the project’s area enrichment with
endangered and vulnerable tree species that will generate employment throughout the duration of
the project.

Without the implementation of this project, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission removal than the continuously flooded. \r\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48% .

1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The purpose of this grouped project activity is to electrify about 170,000 rural inhabitants and
neighbouring SMEs around Alaotra lake, through the installation and operation of run-off river mini-
hydropower plants in Madagascar.
The installation of 700 kW in Maheriara and 1,600 kW in Androkabe, in the Aloatra-Mangoro region, will
generate an average of 10,5 GWh per year. Their combined operations will reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by 12,748 tCO /yr, a result of the substitution of fossil-fuel based power generation by clean 2
and renewable energy. The technology to be employed is hydraulic & electromechanical equipment
including mini-hydroelectricity turbines and generators, as well as transformers feeding in to medium and
low tension grids. The project activity instances will benefit over 6,500 households, schools, public
services and approximately 1,600 entrepreneurs.

industry and agricultural purposes (primarily cattle ranching and now palm oil), Aquaculture (shrimp
farming), and local infrastructure development, such as road and bridge construction.
BlueMX is working with private landowners, local ejido communities and government agencies to
secure mangrove ecosystems through legal contractual relationships with the legal possessors of
the land. In return for entering into contractual relationships, BlueMX, at its own expense, will
restore degraded mangrove areas through hydrological and sedimentological restoration activities
and then reforest restored areas with various native mangrove species via direct planting and via
nurseries. In addition to restoring and reforesting degraded mangrove areas at no cost to the
landowner, BlueMX will share in the carbon finance with the landowner.
BlueMX has also secured the conservation of significant areas of mangrove forest ecosystems near
restoration project areas where BlueMX will conduct conservation activities. These conservation
projects and activities will be registered with Verra separately as individual REDD+ projects.

1.14 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
The conditions of the Project Area prior to the start of the project can be described as a natural
forest ranging from degraded to heavily degraded in condition. The Marudi, Marau, Tasong blocks
are predominantly peatlands and would have been converted to forest plantations under the Tree
Planting Plan before the decision to implement carbon project. The condition of the project site was
not a result of actions by the project or related parties to purposely create GHG emission potential
for subsequent reduction.
We demonstrate that the project has not been implemented to generate GHG emissions for the
purpose of their subsequent reduction, removal or destruction in Section 3.1.4 and the project’s
baseline scenario and additionality is justified by using “VT0001 – T-ADD - Tool for the
demonstration and assessment of additionality in VCS Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use

SECTION D. Application of a monitoring methodology and plan:
D.1. Name and reference of approved monitoring methodology applied to the small-scale
project activity:
The monitoring shall consist of “Metering the Electricity Generated by the Renewable
Technology”, as defined by the used baseline methodology AMS I.D. in Appendix B of the simplified
modalities and procedures for small-scale CDM project activities.
D.2. Justification of the choice of the methodology and why it is applicable to the small-scale
project activity:
The project activity is the generation of electricity using hydropower potential and exporting the electricity
to an electricity distribution system (grid) that is or would have been supplied by at least one fossil fuel or
non-renewable biomass fired generation unit. Since the project activity is based on hydro as renewable
energy source and comprises no co-fired generation unit, only the electricity produced by the generating
unit must be monitored according to the methodology AMS I.D.

1.3 Estimated amount of emission reductions over the crediting
period including project size:
The project is expected to reduce about 69921 tonnes of CO 2
equivalents per year i.e. over the crediting period of 10
years the estimated amount of emission reductions will be
699210 tonnes of CO equivalent. 2
The above project with 69921 tonnes of CO equivalent 2
emission reduction per year falls midway between Mega
Projects greater than 1,000,000 tCO e/year and Micro Projects 2
with less than 5,000 tCO e/year emission reduction. 2
1.4 A brief description of the project:
ITC (Paper and Speciality Paper Division) PSPD, Coimbatore
Unit (herein refer to as ITC), a part of the ITC Limited
group, have installed a co-generation plant and is utilizing
agro residues (waste biomass) co-fired with fossil fuel for
the generation of steam and electricity. The main objective
of the project is to meet the parent paper mill’s total
energy (both thermal and electrical) requirement in an
efficient manner utilizing renewable agro residues abundantly
available in the region and avoid the usage of fossil fuel to
the extent agro residue becomes available. The installed
power generating capacity of the project is 8MW . electrical
Utilization of waste biomass not only reduces GHG emission by
displacing fossil fuel but also helps control indiscriminate
open air burning and decomposition in fields under anaerobic
condition. Open air burning of biomass leads to N O emission 2
and decomposition of biomasses on the fields results in
methane emission and obnoxious odour problems. Both N O and 2
CH have higher global warming potential (GWP) than CO . 4 2
Further, projects of this kind would marginally provide
solutions to the problem of space constraint for the disposal
and decomposition of agro residues, a common agricultural
waste management problem, in all agriculture based nations
including in India.
The biomass residues fired in the project boiler are mainly
De-oiled Rice Bran (DOB), and Saw Dust, and Wood
Chips/Chipped Saw Dust in small amount. ITC carried out a
survey of the surplus availability of the biomass residues
like De-oiled Rice Bran (DOB), Saw Dust, Wood chips/Chipped
Saw Dust in the region within a radius of 200 km from the
project site. The survey was conducted by the Department of
Agricultural Economics Centre for Agricultural and Rural
Development Studies, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University. The
survey report reveals that DOB, Saw Dust and Wood
Chips/Chipped Saw Dust have a surplus availability of 62.49%,

reduction is limited to the actual amount of fossil fuel
replaced by biomass.
1.5 Project location including geographic and physical
information allowing the unique identification and

1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:
The Paperboard facility at Kovai, Coimbatore was acquired by
ITC Limited from BILT Industrial Packaging Company in March,
2004. The commercial production under ITC management began on
29th March, 2004. The Mill earlier had a single board machine
with a capacity of 65000 TPA. With the increase in the
competitiveness of the Unit it has further potential to make
90000 TPA1 of Recycled Boards for Indian and export markets.
Prior to project initiation, the Unit used to meet its need
of process steam through in-house steam generation utilising
predominantly lignite as a fossil fuel and a negligible
proportion of biomass residues such as DOB and Saw Dust (1.5%
in terms of energy). The biomass residues as a practice were
used exclusively for boiler start up. During December 2003
and January 2004 biomass residues were fired as a trial run
prior to the implementation of the project activity. However,
during the baseline period of 2002 to 2004, proportion of
firing of biomass residues was as negligible as 1.5% of the
total energy input. To meet the electrical energy
requirements of the plant the Unit was dependent exclusively
on the electricity imported from grid.
With regard to the agro based residues, the earlier practice
involved partial disposal of the major proportion of the agro
residues in the fields or are fired in the open. This
resulted in decaying of biomass in anaerobic condition
leading to methane emissions and where the biomass is burnt
in the fields, N O was emitted. 2
1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG emission
reductions and/or removal enhancements:
The project utilized biomass residues (agro residue mix of
primarily saw dust, de-oiled rice bran and also some amount
of chipped saw dust) available in the region of its operation
as primary fuels. In the absence of the project, the ITC
would have run the co-generation plant based on 100% lignite.
Thus, by using biomass residues as fuel, the project actually
displaces fossil fuel (lignite) and thus reduces GHG Emission
1 Source: http://www.itcpspd.com/aboutus/aboutus.html. Addition of power block and de-inking facility (removal of
ink from waste paper) will increase the competitiveness of the Unit, with potential to make 200000 TPA of Recycled
Boards for Indian and export markets.

2.1.14 Project Start Date
The project’s start date is February 1st, 2015. TIST Uganda is a constantly growing program that seeks to
verify subsections of the program whenever possible. Data for this project was pulled from the database
on February 1st, 2020. The program is claiming a February 15th, 2015 start date for this project to include
the maximum allowable amount of activity.
Evidence of the project’s start date can be found in the ages of the trees included in this project. Trees
are planted virtually every day in TIST Uganda. The oldest trees in the project were 5 years old at the
time data was pulled. As such, the best possible estimation for the project start date is February 1st,
2015.20
TIST quantifiers are trained to assess the age and species of trees. The program sets an internal goal to
quantify trees every 18 months. More frequent quantifications than the required 5-year interval allow TIST
to accurately measure the age of individual trees. These ages are incorporated into our database when
trees are young (and easier to ascertain the age of the tree). Through the individual counting and
monitoring of trees, the program is able to establish the minimum and maximum age of trees in individual
groves. This monitoring takes place in conjunction with consultation of farmers who can speak to the age
of their seedlings.
The TIST database automatically rolls forward tree ages. As such, a data set run on February 01, 2020
will include trees planted 5 years (but no more) previously. Thus, the program can assess a February 01,
2015 start date of the activities that led to the generation of GHG emission reductions.

A total of 8,425 households (36,059 farmers) were involved in the project. Without the project, local villagers would not have access to intermittently flooded technology and intact facilities to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously flooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Due to the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in the paddy soil under flooded conditions, a large amount of methane can be released, so the intermittently flooded method is more conducive to water efficiency, improving rice yield and reducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.\r\nThe implementation activities of the project include promoting intermittently flooded technology, technical training for the farmers, facility repair and replacement, etc. According to the needs of rice growth, farmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water resources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic conditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice paddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in the rainy season.\r\nThe project is expected to reduce GHG emissions by 416,395 tCO2e in the first seven-year period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 59,485 tCO2e.

1 Project Details
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
This project leverages carbon finance to avoid mosaic conversion of tropical forests and therefore
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The project employs a Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and
Degradation (REDD) project methodology to determine the magnitude of these emissions reductions.
Through a combination of forest protection and sustainable development activities, this project is
estimated to avoid the emission of 2.5 Million metric tonnes of CO e over the project lifetime that 2
would have resulted from deforestation of
approximately 50% of the project area
over the next thirty years.
The Chocó-Darién Conservation Corridor is
located in the Darién region of northwest
Colombia within the administrative
jurisdictions of the Department of Chocó
and the Municipality of Acandí. The
Colombian Darién is part of the Chocó
biogeographic region, recognized as one of
the most biodiverse regions in the world
for its strategic geographic location and
high levels of species endemism.
The project is additional because the
project activities would not have been
possible without carbon financing. The
project baseline is an extension of actual
deforestation that was occurring
aggressively in the reference area adjacent
to the project area.
1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
The project falls under VCS Sectoral Scope 14 - Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses under project

Selabam Hydropower Extension Project (hereafter referred to as “the project”) is developed by
EDL-Generation Public Company in Champasak province (or called as Champasak). It is a
province located in the southwest of the southern Lao PDR. The project site is about 38.5 km far
from Pakse to north. The primary purpose of the project is to generate electricity to the Lao Power
Grid.
Total installed capacity of the project is 8 MW, provided by two (2) Kaplan turbine with each unit
capacity of 4MW. Project is commissioned on 14-December-2022 with an average annual output
of 22,640 MWh.
The project is expected to constantly contribute clean energy to the Lao Power Grid. It not only
conforms to the present situation, but also can adapt to future changes in the electricity market.
The baseline scenario of the project is continuation of the present situation, i.e., electricity
supplied from the power grid. By displacing part of the power generated by thermal power plants,
the project is therefore expected to reduce total emission reduction of 73,566 tCO e during the 2
first crediting period with average annual emission reduction of 10,509 tCO e per year. 2
The project is not only supplying renewable electricity to grid, but also producing positive
environmental and economic benefits and also, promotes the local sustainable development in
the following aspects:
• During the construction period, plenty of job opportunities were provided to local
residents,
• The infrastructure has been greatly improved. The enhancement of the transportation
and electricity system brings substantial benefits to local villagers;
• The use of fossil fuel will be reduced because of displacement by grid electricity, this
reduces the fossil fuel-based electricity generation;
• Provide clean & cheap electricity in this region, promote the sustainable development in
this region and slowing down the increasing trend of GHG emissions.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The Hydroelectric Project El Edén (hereafter, the project activity or project) is implemented by Central
Hidroeléctrica El Edén S.A.S E.S.P (hereafter, the project proponent).
The project activity is a hydroelectric power plant that utilizes water from the Río La Miel (“La Miel river”),
located in the river basin “La Miel” in the east of the Department of Caldas, Colombia (hereafter, the Host
Country), about 125 kilometres from the City of Cali close to the municipalities of Pensilvania, Marquetalia
and Manzanares.
Before the implementation of the project activity, no power plant is installed at the project site. The energy
that will be generated by the project is currently dispatched by other power plants that are connected to
the national grid, and that include fossil fuel power plants. Hence, the baseline scenario and the scenario
prior to project implementation are the same and the project will help to reduce thermal power generation
in the National Interconnected System (SIN1) by providing renewable energy to the grid.
The project activity is a run-of-river hydroelectric plant that includes the construction and installation of a
concrete weir and intake, a desander, channel, forebay/settling tank, high-pressure penstock,
powerhouse and discharge channel. Two Pelton turbines with 10.115 MW and two synchronous
generators with 11,174 kVA each2 will be installed. Each generator will be connected to a transformer to
increase the voltage from 6.6 kV to 35 kV at the project site. The installed capacity of the plant at the
interconnection point will be around 19.5 MW (this is based on the design and can vary slightly at real
conditions).
The electricity generated by the project is expected to be around 104.5 GWh per year, which will be
delivered to the SIN. It will help to reduce thermal power generation in the SIN by providing renewable
energy to the grid. Thus, it will contribute to sustainability by increasing the share of renewable energy
and reducing GHG emissions. The expected average annual emission reductions are 32,102 tCO during 2
a renewable 10-years crediting period.
Moreover, the project activity will facilitate the achievement of electricity demand required for the social
and economic development of the country based on a renewable energy source. The project will
contribute to the region’s sustainable development in the following ways:
The project will decrease emissions of sulphur oxides (SO ), nitrogen oxides (NO ), carbon x x
monoxide, particulate matter, other pollutants, as well as carbon dioxide associated with the
combustion of fossil fuels.
The project will reduce the dependence on fossil fuels, which are non-renewable and limited in
supply.
During construction, the project will provide employment opportunities. To the extent practical,
these jobs will be filled by local residents. Besides, employment will also be generated for
operation and maintenance activities.

Project Description: VCS Version 4.2
1.11 Description of the Project Activity
- The Rio Manito Grouped REDD Project is a grouped project that consists in the
implementation of conservation measures for avoiding unplanned deforestation within the
Project Area.
- Instances adopt forest conservation measures such as recruitment and management of
surveillance teams to monitor on-site suspicious and/or illegal activities and control of
invasions within the project area. Other mitigation actions proposed by the Project in order
to avoid unplanned deforestation will be carried out by strengthening surveillance in the
area, mapping the local deforestation patterns, setting partnerships with educational and
research institutions, and through providing benefits to surrounding communities, aiming to
minimize invasions and illegal deforestation, offering alternative income, education and
professional training.
- Therefore, besides forest conservation, the present project aims to improve and quantify its
social and environmental activities that benefit the local communities, through application
of the SOCIALCARBON® Methodology. This methodology measures the contribution of
carbon projects towards sustainable development. The SOCIALCARBON® Methodology is
based on six main indicators: Biodiversity; Natural; Financial; Human; Social and Carbon
Resources and aims to deliver high-integrity benefits in each in order to improve social and
environmental conditions in the project region.
- The implementation of REDD + SOCIALCARBON mechanisms promotes sustainable
development through forest conservation resulting in the permanence of carbon stocks,
while reducing pressure for timber from other forest areas. In this way, biodiversity
conservation and development of the local economy can be achieved simultaneously.
- All the aforementioned measures are expected to result in net GHG emission reductions by
preventing illegal deforestation agents to advance with their activities, as well as by
retrieving their practices and, therefore, protecting and even restoring the carbon pools.
- It is important to highlight that this project is not located within a jurisdiction covered by a
jurisdictional REDD+ program.

Project Description: VCS Version 4.2
1.13 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
Prior to the initiation of the project, several conditions exist that are unsustainable and
contribute to the emission of greenhouse gases. A significant one is crop burning. Crop burning
is a common practice in sugarcane farming in the area. This is typically done to remove the
excess leaves and stems after the harvesting of the sugarcane. This process results in the
release ofsignificant amountsofGHGsanddepletessoilfertility.
Secondly there are inefficient farming practices such as overuse of fertilizers, pesticides, and
irrigation, which can also contribute to GHG emissions. Overuse of fertilizers leads to the
release ofnitrousoxide, whileinefficient irrigationpracticescanlead tothewasteofenergy.
All this is connected to a lack of awareness among farmers about the harmful effects of crop
burning andother inefficient farmingpractices.
The project has not been implemented to generate GHG emissions for the purpose of their
subsequent reduction, removal or destruction. Instead, the project aims to reduce GHG
emissions by addressing the conditions mentioned above. And to demonstrate this, the project
will promote sustainable farming practices, and conduct awareness campaigns to inform
farmers about the harmful effects of crop burning and the importance of sustainable farming
practices. The project will establish a monitoring and reporting system to track the project's
impact on reducing GHG emissions. Overall, byimplementing these strategies, the project aims
to address the underlying conditions that contribute to GHG emissions in the sugarcane
farmingindustry.

1.13 Conditions Before Project Initiation
Before the project, the economic development of the project area was relatively poor, and the
local farmers lacked advanced irrigation technologies such as intermittent flood irrigation. The
intermittent irrigation method requires that in the process of rice cultivation, irrigation and
drainage can be controlled by ditches and valves according to the growing needs of rice. The low
economic level leads to the low income of farmers, which means that farmers do not have the
additional financial capacity to afford the construction of cement ditches that can implement
controlled irrigation and drainage. Therefore, the project has not yet been implemented to
generate greenhouse gas emissions for subsequent reduction, removal, or destruction.

Without the project, there would be no ditches, pumps, valves, and reservoirs to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional continuously flooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was cultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded conditions can emit a large amount of methane because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittently flooded method is more conducive to saving water, increasing rice yield, and reducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.', 'project_state_province': 'Hainan', 'project_country': 'China', 'project_latitude': 18.7, 'project_longitude': 109.08}","4","3","5","5","3","0.17","745","-"

Sustainable Development
The National CDM Authority (NCDMA), which is the Designated National Authority (DNA) for the
Government of India (GOI) under the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), has mentioned four
indicators for the sustainable development in the interim approval guidelines for Clean Development
Mechanism (CDM) projects from India. Thus, the project’s contribution towards sustainable development
has been addressed based on the following sustainable development aspects:
Social Well-being: Project activity instances of this grouped project are reducing specific fossil fuel
consumption per unit of output generation by adopting energy efficiency measures in existing steam
turbines. Hence, helps in reserving the fossil fuel resource and reducing the dependency up to a certain
extent. Project activity instances will boost country’s energy security by contributing in efficient way. Also,
helps in reducing GHG emission associated with the operation of fossil fuel fired captive power plant.
Economic Well-being: The project activity will also create business opportunities for contractors,
technology consultants and suppliers in terms of retrofit/modification and supply of existing turbine. Thus,
project activity would bring economic benefits for the local community and would lead to sustainable
economic and industrial growth in the region and country.
Environmental Well-being: The project activity instances are reducing fossil fuel consumption per unit of
baseline output generation thus reducing the GHG emission associated with the generation through
energy efficiency measures, thus help in reduction in further exploitation and depletion of fossil fuels. The
electricity generated from the project activity would help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and other
associated pollutants from fossil fuel based thermal power plant; equivalent of which would have been
emitted in absence of the project activity.
Technological Well-being: The project activity employs the energy efficiency measures by retrofitting in
existing steam turbines which reduces the specific fuel consumption in fossil fuel fired captive power
plant. Thus, encouraging the captive power generating industrial units for adopting such measures which
will enhance energy efficiency in the industry and helps nation to grow in sustainable manner.
Further Information
The initial project instance is coming in First-of its-kind WEG facility.

"What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?","Based on the information provided, the project sector mentioned in the document is Renewable Energy. The alternative scenarios discussed include the construction of a power plant using other sources of renewable energy with equivalent electricity generation. Although a wind farm or biomass power plant is mentioned as a possible alternative, they are not considered feasible due to factors such as costly capital investment and uncertainty regarding their availability in the area. Therefore, the project focuses on renewable energy generation.","PROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM PDD) - Version 03.1.

B.5. Description of how the anthropogenic em issions of GHG by sources are reduced below 
those that would have occurred in the absence of  the registered CDM project activity (assessment 
and demonstration of additionality):  
>> 
This section will demonstrate the additionality of the project in accordance with the “Tool for the 
demonstration and assessment of Additionality, Version 03”. 
 
Step 1. Identification of Alternative to the project  activity consistent with current laws and regulations  
 
Sub-step 1a. Define alternatives to the project activity 
 
According to the status of China Power Grid, four alternative scenarios were c onsidered for the proposed 
project: 
Alternative Scenario (a), The proposed project ac tivity undertaken without being registered as a CDM 
project activity; 
Alternative Scenario (b), Construction of a fuel-fi red power plant with equivalent amount of annual 
electricity generation; 
Alternative Scenario (c), Construction of a power plant using other sources of renewable energy with 
equivalent amount of annual electricity generation; and 
Alternative Scenario (d), Continuation of the current s ituation. Electricity will con tinue to be generated by 
the existing generation mix operating in the grid. 
 Alternative scenario (c), power plant using other sour ces of renewable energy with equivalent amount of 
annual electricity generation could be a wind farm  or a biomass power plant in current technology 
conditions. A wind farm is not commercially viable due  to costly capital investment. There are some wind 
farms in the same area, however, some wind farms had been registered as CDM projects
2 and some wind 
farms are in the processes of registering as CDM project3. And it is not know there is a biomass power 
plant in the same area. So the altern ative scenario (c) is not considered as a feasible alternative scenario to 
the proposed project.  
Outcome of sub-step 1a : The realistic and credible alternative scenarios are scenario (a), (b) and (d). 
 Sub-step 1b. Consistency with mandatory laws and regulations: 
 
In the context of the Chinese power sector’s transf ormation to a market-oriented system, whether to 
invest in a power generation project is an indivi dual power project developer’s decision based on the 
project return and risk profile
4. There are no laws compelling the project developer to develop 
hydroelectric plants, thus alternative scenario (a) and (d) are in line with all applicable laws and 
regulations. 
 The main sectoral policy relevant to this project activ ity is the promotion of renewable energy in China, 
the Renewable Energy Law of the People’s Repub lic of China, which came into effect on 1
st January 
2006. This law demonstrates the Chinese Government’s  commitment to the development of renewable 
energy as part of the overall energy developmen t strategy, and encourages grid-connected power 
generation from renewable sources. However, there are no direct incentives such as financial grants 
higher tariffs or subsidised loans available for these ty pes of project. In addition to that, moves to increase
