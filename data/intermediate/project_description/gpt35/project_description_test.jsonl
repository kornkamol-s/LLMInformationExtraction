Identification of alternative land use scenarios\na. Continuation of the pre-project land use as private wildlife sanctuary:\nPrior to the implementation of the REDD project on Rukinga, the Project proponents had\nspent a significant and unsustainable amount of money over the last ten years financing\nactivities to attempt to protect the forest from destruction. Those activities provided no\nsignificant sources of income from the land to offset the land protection costs, and\ntherefore this project would eventually have failed financially if carbon funding were not\nmade available.\nb. Uses a in the ten years prior to Project start date:\nCattle Ranching - When the current majority landowners acquired their interest in\nRukinga Sanctuary in 2000, the previous owners were operating a financially\nunsuccessful cattle ranching operation on the land. The area is too dry with no\npermanent water for successful cattle ranching, and there was predation by lions on the\ncattle at a rate that lead to the financial failure of the operation, and eventual sale of the\nland to the majority shareholder of Wildlife Works.\nEcotourism - The prior owners also had an ecotourism facility on the Project area, but as\nevidence that these activities were not financially viable on the land, the slash and burn\nclearing had reached within 200 meters of the ecotourism facility, causing it to fail and\nmove away.\nc. Slash and Burn Agriculture by subsistence farmers:\nPrior to the Project Proponent taking over management of the land in 2005, local people\nhad begun to clear part of the Project area, and have systematically cleared the dryland\nforest from a majority of the Reference area in order to provide land for annual crops.\nThis is evidently the most likely Baseline scenario, as it had been carried out routinely\nthroughout the Reference region, in clear violation of land laws.\n2. Consistency of credible land uses with enforced mandatory laws and regulations:\nAll of the alternative land use scenarios above represent legal land uses, with the exception of\nslash and burn agriculture, which essentially consists of squatting on privately owned land; illegal\nunder Kenyan law. However, there is overwhelming evidence that this law had been\nsystematically unenforced, as greater than 30% of the area of the administrative unit that\nencompasses the project area had been deforested in the ten years prior to the Project start date.\nThus, all the land uses above are credible.\n3. Investment Analysis \u2013 Simple Cost Analysis:\nPhysical protection of the Project area, and provision of deforestation mitigation activities, such as\nschool building, scholarships, ranger patrols, reforestation of deforested indigenous forests etc.\nfor the community cost the Project Proponent approximately $300-400,000 per year in the years\n\u00a9 Wildlife Works Carbon, LLC 2010 50\n\nKasigau Corridor REDD Project Phase I \u2013 VCS PD Requirements\nprior to implementation of the VCS AFOLU project. There exists no significant income to offset\nthese costs. In the absence of active protection, both physical and that created by partnering with\nthe communities to create economic alternatives, it is clear the land in the Project area would be\ncleared aggressively for subsistence agriculture, as that was in fact what was already happening\nprior to our arrival. Slash and burn agriculture faces no economic barriers, and is therefore once\nagain the most likely Baseline scenario.\n4. Common Practice Analysis\nIt is common practice to protect wilderness in Africa, and to provide sustainable development\nsupport for rural African communities, but that common practice is typically funded by\ngovernments or donor agencies, and not by financial return from the project activities. It is NOT\ncommon practice for private companies that are not donor funded, such as the Project proponent\nto protect forested wilderness in Africa for financial return, in the absence of AFOLU revenues.\nThe Project proponent\u2019s Rukinga Sanctuary project is the first AFOLU Project Activity of its type\nin Kenya, and one of the very first in Africa.\nSummary of Additionality Test\nIn summary;\n\uf0b7 the Kasigau Corridor REDD project is not the only credible alternative land use consistent with\nenforced mandatory applicable laws,\n\uf0b7 one of those alternative land uses, that of Slash and Burn Agriculture is by far the most likely\nbaseline land use,\n\uf0b7 the Kasigau Corridor project passes the Investment Analysis Test as it is not a financially viable\nland use without the AFOLU VCS project revenues\n\uf0b7 and the project activities are NOT common practice.\ntherefore it is additional under the rules of VT0001 Tool for the Demonstration of Additionality in VCS\nAFOLU Project Activities.\n\u00a9 Wildlife Works Carbon, LLC 2010 51\n\n[['', '', '', '', '2005', '', '', '2006', '', '', '2007', '', '', '2008', '', '', '2009', '', '', '2010', ''], ['Linear Model (%) 3.16% 6.33% 9.49% 12.66% 15.82% 18.99%', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['AGLT 50,776 50,776 50,776 50,776 50,776 50,776', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['BGLT 20,310 20,310 20,310 20,310 20,310 20,310', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['AGST 0 0 0 0 0 0', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['BGST 0 0 0 0 0 0', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['AGNT 8,556 8,556 8,556 8,556 8,556 8,556', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['BGNT 3,422 3,422 3,422 3,422 3,422 3,422', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['SDW 0 0 0 0 0 0', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['LDW 0 0 0 0 0 0', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['WP 0 0 0 0 0 0', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['SOIL 119,709 155,515 166,225 169,429 170,387 170,674', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], ['Total Emissions 202,774 238,580 249,290 252,494 253,452 253,739', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]]\nKasigau Corridor REDD Project Phase I \u2013 VCS PD Requirements\nSection 8 Baseline Emissions\nBaseline emissions are calculated as the carbon pools measured in the project area, which are applied to\nthe cumulative deforestation model (determined by sampling historical imagery).

{"input":"Question: What is the project province, country, latitude, and longitude of this project?\n\nContext: 2.1.1 Summary Description of the Project (G1.2)\nThe PLUM Peat and Mangrove Conservation and Restoration Project (PLUM Project) is a conservation\nand restoration project of peat and mangrove forests located in Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia.\nThe project is implemented on a 23,665-hectare forest concession with Forest Utilization Business License,\nheld by PT Pagatan Usaha Makmur (PT PUM) for 60 years. The project will implement activities to conserve\nand restore the peat and mangrove forests in the project area while delivering positive impact on the\ncommunity and biodiversity. Among others, the project will implement forest patrols, fire prevention, and\nbiodiversity monitoring activities to prevent forest loss and protect biodiversity. Peat ecosystems will be\nrestored by blocking canals and rewetting the area to avoid further peat drainage. Approximately 15,088\nha of degraded land will be restored through reforestation and Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR).\nThe eastern part of the project is a peatland forest area located in Katingan Regency, Katingan Kuala Sub-\ndistrict, adjacent to the Sebangau National Park. The western part of the concession is located in East\nKotawaringin Regency, Pulau Hanaut Sub-district, and mostly consists of mangrove forests (Map 2-1).\nBased on the conducted biodiversity assessment, the concession provides important habitat for 31\nthreatened species, including the Bornean orangutan, the Proboscis monkey, and the Bornean white-\nbearded gibbon. The area is also important for at least 17 migratory bird species from three families.\nThe project will provide tangible benefits to local communities living in the surrounding area by working to\nimprove local livelihoods, health, education, and well-being. For example, the project will assist local coffee\nfarmers and honey producers to improve harvesting, processing, and market access. The project will\nsupport the establishment of women\u2019s groups in the target villages to promote economic opportunities for\nwomen; and implement interventions that improve health and sanitation in the 13 target villages.\nPrior to PT PUM receiving its principal PBPH license in 2022, the project area was planned to be developed\nas an oil palm plantation along with two other companies adjacent to the area. All three companies were\nowned by a company group named PT Agro Inti Semesta (PT AIS). Additionally, in 2022, an approval to\nconvert forest land into oil palm plantation was given to another oil palm company located along the western\nboundary of PT PUM. Without the PLUM Project, it is highly likely that PT PUM\u2019s area would have been\ndeveloped into an oil palm plantation by PT AIS.\nThe project will generate GHG emission reductions or removals by implementing activities covered by the\nVM0007 REDD+ Methodology Framework including (1) Avoiding Planned Deforestation (APD), (2)\nAfforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR), (3) Restoration of Wetlands Ecosystems (RWE) on\nPeatland and Tidal Wetlands, and (4) Avoiding Planned Wetland Degradation (APWD) on Peatland and\nTidal Wetlands. It is estimated that the project will generate a total net Verified Carbon Unit (VCU) volume\nof 69,999,940 tCO e over 60 years of crediting period or 1,166,666 tCO e per annum (Table 3-44). 2 2\nThe project\u2019s goal is to conserve the remaining forest, restore ecosystem function, protect biodiversity, and\nimprove the well-being of communities to become resilient to climate change. In conclusion, it is expected\nthat the PLUM Project will contribute to preserving the integrity of the Peat Swamp and Mangrove Forest\nlandscape and biodiversity in the area while improving the well-being of local communities.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 16\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3","question":"What is the project province, country, latitude, and longitude of this project?","context":"2.1.1 Summary Description of the Project (G1.2)\nThe PLUM Peat and Mangrove Conservation and Restoration Project (PLUM Project) is a conservation\nand restoration project of peat and mangrove forests located in Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia.\nThe project is implemented on a 23,665-hectare forest concession with Forest Utilization Business License,\nheld by PT Pagatan Usaha Makmur (PT PUM) for 60 years.

The western part of the concession is located in East\nKotawaringin Regency, Pulau Hanaut Sub-district, and mostly consists of mangrove forests (Map 2-1).\nBased on the conducted biodiversity assessment, the concession provides important habitat for 31\nthreatened species, including the Bornean orangutan, the Proboscis monkey, and the Bornean white-\nbearded gibbon. The area is also important for at least 17 migratory bird species from three families.\nThe project will provide tangible benefits to local communities living in the surrounding area by working to\nimprove local livelihoods, health, education, and well-being. For example, the project will assist local coffee\nfarmers and honey producers to improve harvesting, processing, and market access. The project will\nsupport the establishment of women\u2019s groups in the target villages to promote economic opportunities for\nwomen; and implement interventions that improve health and sanitation in the 13 target villages.\nPrior to PT PUM receiving its principal PBPH license in 2022, the project area was planned to be developed\nas an oil palm plantation along with two other companies adjacent to the area. All three companies were\nowned by a company group named PT Agro Inti Semesta (PT AIS). Additionally, in 2022, an approval to\nconvert forest land into oil palm plantation was given to another oil palm company located along the western\nboundary of PT PUM. Without the PLUM Project, it is highly likely that PT PUM\u2019s area would have been\ndeveloped into an oil palm plantation by PT AIS.\nThe project will generate GHG emission reductions or removals by implementing activities covered by the\nVM0007 REDD+ Methodology Framework including (1) Avoiding Planned Deforestation (APD), (2)\nAfforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR), (3) Restoration of Wetlands Ecosystems (RWE) on\nPeatland and Tidal Wetlands, and (4) Avoiding Planned Wetland Degradation (APWD) on Peatland and\nTidal Wetlands. It is estimated that the project will generate a total net Verified Carbon Unit (VCU) volume\nof 69,999,940 tCO e over 60 years of crediting period or 1,166,666 tCO e per annum (Table 3-44). 2 2\nThe project\u2019s goal is to conserve the remaining forest, restore ecosystem function, protect biodiversity, and\nimprove the well-being of communities to become resilient to climate change. In conclusion, it is expected\nthat the PLUM Project will contribute to preserving the integrity of the Peat Swamp and Mangrove Forest\nlandscape and biodiversity in the area while improving the well-being of local communities.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 16\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3","groundtruth":"{'project_state_province': 'Central Kalimantan', 'project_country': 'Indonesia'}"}

Type and category(ies) and technology\/measure of the small-scale project activity:\nSince the capacity of the wind farm project is 9 MW, which is less than the maximum qualifying capacity\nof 15 MW, the project falls under the UNFCCC small-scale CDM project activity categories under Type-I\nwith project activity being renewable electricity generation for a grid.\nSectoral Scope: 1 \u2013 Energy Industries (renewable-\/non-renewable sources)\nType: I -Renewable Energy Projects\nCategory: I.D \u201cGrid connected renewable electricity generation\u201d\nAs per paragraph 1 under Category I.D of Appendix B of the UNFCCC-defined simplified modalities\nand procedures (M&P) for small-scale CDM project activities (Version 10: 23rd December 2006)\nType I.D \u201ccomprises renewables, such as photovoltaics, hydro, tidal\/wave, wind, geothermal, and\nbiomass, that supply electricity to an electricity distribution system that is or would have been supplied by\nat least one fossil fuel or non-renewable biomass fired generating unit\u201d. The project is a grid-connected\nwind based power plant and qualifies as a Category I. D project activity.\nThe technology consists of conversion of the energy available in the wind flow to mechanical energy\nusing a wind turbine. By connecting the turbine to a generator, the mechanical energy is converted into\nelectricity energy. Therefore, in this process, there are no greenhouse gas emissions or burning of any\nfossil fuels.
