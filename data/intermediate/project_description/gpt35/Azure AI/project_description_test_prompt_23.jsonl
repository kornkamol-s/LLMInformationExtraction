The project activity has installed 25 MWp\ngrid connected solar power project. The project activity will supply power to the regional NEWNE\ngrid and hence replaces the equal amount of power which would have otherwise been generated\nby grid connected carbon intensive power plants.\nThe process of generating power through solar energy is a clean technology, as there is no fossil\nfuel fired or no green house gases are emitted during the process. The generated power from this\nproject activity is supplied to the NEWNE grid. The project participant has signed Power Purchase\nAgreement (PPA) for 25 years period, with Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL). The solar\nmodules used in the project activity are of 230Wp, 235Wp and 240Wp. A total of 107,712\nnumbers of solar modules of varying module capacity are used in the project activity.\nThis is a CDM registered verification project. The reference number of the project is 7373 and\nregistration date on 09th November 2012 (Date of registration action 29th January 2013).

{"input":"Question: What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?\n\nContext: \n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\n1 PROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nThe project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice\ncultivation is conducted in Changxing County under the jurisdiction of Huzhou City,\nZhejiang Province of China, which have a total acreage of 12,243 ha for single-cropping\nrice. Without this project providing ditches to conduct intermittent flooded method, the\ncontinuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated\nby continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice\nsoil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH ) because of 4\nanaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water\nconservation, production increase and methane emission removal than the continuously\nflooded.\nThe methane emission is expected to be less under the project scenario than under the\nbaseline scenario.\nWith the project implementation, the cement ditches, reservoirs and relevant technical\ntraining are provided for these farmers to help them conduct the intermittent flooded water\nregime during rice cultivation, which replaces the traditional continuously flooded method.\nDuring rice cultivation, controllable irrigation and drainage according to rice growth\nrequirements can not only save water resources, but also reduce methane emission from\nsoil organic matter under anaerobic conditions (in the flooded state). In this case, the CH 4\nemission can be declined by an average of 48%1. Hence, this project activity is estimated\nto reduce 4.88 tCO e\/ha. 2\nThe implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to\n418,621 tCO e in the first seven-year period with an average annual GHG emission 2\nreduction of 59,803 tCO e. 2\nThis project aims to:\n- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;\n- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;\n- Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers;\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\n1 Dr. Reiner Wassmann (2016).

As a framework of the FWL, \u201cThe National Constitution\u201d (La Constitucion Politica del\nPeru) provides that natural resources are patrimony of the nation, stating that by Institutional Law it would\nbe determined mechanisms through which private owners can be granted with natural resources\u2019 rights of\nuse.. \u201cThe Institutional Law for the Sustainable Use of Resources\u201d (Ley Org\u00e1nica para el\nAprovechamiento Sostenible de los Recursos Naturales, Ley No. 26821) states in Article 4 that \u201cthe fruits\nand products of natural resources ... are owned by the holders of the right of use of such fruits and\nproducts\u201d .\u201d This right of use is included in a number of legal instruments, depending on the natural\nresource the private owner wants to use.\nThe applicable Law for the use of forestry and wildlife resources is the Forestry and Wildlife Law (Ley\nForestal y de Fauna Silvestre) \u2013 Law 27308. Under this law, and its regulation, forestry plantations\nlocated in private property which contain natural resources (i.e. timber-related and non timber-related\nresources, such as environmental services) can be used by the owner of such private property. Under\nthis law, there are two procedural conditions required by the owner to start using its forestry resources:\nthe registry of their land as a forest plantation, and the acquisition of a forestry permit (the later requires\nthe submission of the land ownership\/title documentation to a governmental agency).\nHowever, Peru has seen the development of the New Forestry and Wildlife Law (Nueva Ley Forestal y de\nFauna Silvestre \u2013 NLFFS) \u2013 Ley 29763. This new law will come into force when its Regulation is\npromulgated, and at that stage the NLFFS will supersede the current Law no. 27308. The NLFFS\nchanges the requirements slightly on forestry plantations located on private lands, providing the\nconstituent right of the owner to use all natural resources that his plantations contains. This mean that the\nonly obligation that remains under this law for private-owned forestry plantations is the registration before\nthe government agency.\nThere is also now a precedent in Peru established by other reforestation projects certified by the VCS and\nother carbon standards, of recognising right of use of carbon offsets by owners of private lands.\n1.12 Ownership and Other Programs\n1.12.1 Right of Use\nProject Requirements\nOnly farmers who have full title to their land (Derecho de Propiedad) can participate in this VCS Grouped\nProject, as only they would have the right to obtain a forestry permit under Peruvian Law, which is\nrequired to be able to obtain the rights to environmental services. Whilst a number of farmers may have\nanother type of rights over the superficial land recognized under Peruvian law, such as \u201cpossession\u201d or\n\u201cright of superficial-land use \u201d (\u201cDerecho de posesi\u00f3n\u201d or \u201cDerecho de uso y habitaci\u00f3n\u201d) they can not\nparticipate in this project until they obtain full title (Derecho de Propiedad) , given that their rights are not\nenough to obtain a forestry permit as described above.\nDocumenting private land title\nIn accordance with the requirements of the VCS Standard Plant your Future has checked that all farmers\nparticipating in the scheme who will be included in the first instances in Loreto and Ucayali have full title,\nincluding documentation and listing with the \u2018public registry\u2019.\nv3.1 32\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nCopies of titles and signed legal agreements are available on request by the auditor.\nThis corresponds to the following right of use requested by the VCS Standard under requirement 3.11:\nA right of use arising by virtue of a statutory, property or contractual right in the land, vegetation or\nconservational or management process that generates GHG emission reductions and\/or removals (where\nsuch right includes the right of use of such reductions or removals and the project proponent has not\nbeen divested of such right of use).\nTransfer of the emission rights\nThe project instances demonstrably complies with VCS Standard Requirement 3.11:\nAn enforceable and irrevocable agreement with the holder of the statutory, property or contractual right in\nthe land, vegetation or conservational or management process that generates GHG emission reductions\nor removals which vests the right of use in the project proponent\nEvery farmers participating in the programme in the first instances in Loreto and Ucayali has signed or will\nsign a contract with Planta tu Futuro setting the conditions of their participation in the program, in which\nthey agree to transfer all of their rights of use over carbon emission reductions generated by the forestry\nplantation\/agroforestry systems to the Civil Association Planta tu Futuro. Planta tu Futuro will take\nresponsibility for the certification of the carbon credits, as well as their sale.\nPlant your Future, in conjunction with partners, has carried out an extensive consultation and capacity\nbuilding process with the smallholder farmers in relation to the legal agreements transferring the carbon\nrights. The concept of carbon rights, carbon offsets and carbon markets was novel to farmers, and\nfarmers had limited knowledge of how carbon certification and commercialisation works. Plant your\nFuture has developed a series of training workshops and take home materials to explain these concepts\nto farmers. Farmers have had the opportunity to participate in a range of large group, small groups and\nindividual workshops and meetings to discuss the issue of the carbon rights. Participation by farmers in\nthe scheme is entirely voluntary, and the programme has been designed with farmer decision making at\nthe centre of the project since its inception. The legal agreement has also undergone an extensive\nreview process from partners and donors, including a revisions process by a third party Peruvian legal\ninstitution to ensure equity and clarity for the smallholders was being given. Third party representative\nhave been present at all plenary workshops to witness transparent information exchange between\nfarmers and Planta tu Futuro representatives e.g. representatives from ProNaturaleza and from the donor\norganisation Instituto Interamericano de Cooperacion por la Agricultura (IICA).\nCopies of this contract are available on request by the auditor.\n1.12.2\nEmissions Trading Programs and Other Binding Limits\nThe GHG reductions or removals generated by this project will not be used for compliance with\nan emissions trading program or to meet biding limits on GHG emissions.\n1.12.3 Participation under Other GHG Programs\nThe project is not seeking registration under any other GHG program.\nv3.1 33","output":"{'organization_name': 'Plant your Future', 'email': 'jennyhenman@plantyourfuture.org.uk', 'country': 'United Kingdom'}"}

It is connected to Antananarivo\nInterconnected Network, and distant by approximately 30 km of the city of Antsirab\u00e9.\nIts geographical coordinates are 47\u00b008\u2019 E - 20\u00b012\u2019 S.\n1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation\nSHPP has a very special role for the future development of the electricity sector in Madagascar\nbeing a first mover in various senses. It has been the first hydro power project implemented in\nMadagascar for 25 years and it is the first privately owned hydro power project at all. It is also the\nfirst project ever registered under the Clean Development Mechanism in Madagascar.\nThe electricity displaced by the project is the electricity generated within the interconnected RI\nTANA, which represents around 70% of national electricity consumption. According to the\nMadagascar Action Plan (MAP) 2007-2012, the current trend in the energy sector is the\ndevelopment of fossil fuel power plant. Simultaneously, there has been a decrease in the\nproportion of hydroelectric power generation leading to a greater reliance on thermal production.\nThermal production accounted for 21% of total power generation in 1997 but rose to 35% by\n2004.\nSo, continuation of current practice for power generation in Madagascar involves a significant\nshare of fossil fuel consumption, including in capacity additions to meet the demand increase, as\nreflected by the rather high Combined Margin emission factor of 0.6456 tCO \/MWh calculated in 2\nsection 3.1.\n1.11 Compliance with Laws, Statutes and Other Regulatory Frameworks\nThere are no restrictions regarding the local regulations and policies preventing the\nimplementation of the project, which is in line with the regulatory or legal requirements existing for\npower plants:\n\u2022 Law No. 98-032 of 20 January 1999 ended the monopoly of JIRAMA (State Water and\nElectricity Corporation) by opening up electric power generation, transmission and\ndistribution to competition. This law authorizes the intervention of private operators\nthrough the award of concessions or permits. They are awarded through a bidding\nprocess based on a Development Master Plan.\n\u2022 The Least Cost Development Plan for the Grid, Hydropower Projects and other Energy\nSources was elaborated for the Ministry of Energy and Mines by Hydro Qu\u00e9bec\nInternational, in May 2005. It covers in detail the opportunities for electricity generation\nfrom hydro and thermal power plants in Madagascar.

Longyuan Mulilo De Aar Wind\nPower (RF) (Pty) Ltd is the wind farm developer. An EPC contract was signed on 06\/02\/20154\nand the wind farm started commercial operation on 31\/10\/2017 and the produced electricity is\nsupplied to the national grid of the RSA.5\nThe energy system of the RSA is dominated by coal-fired power plants and is managed by the\nstate-owned company Eskom which is in charge of generation, transmission and distribution of\npower to end-users. The energy system of the RSA is integrated into the grid of Southern African\nPower Pool (SAPP), where South Africa is represented by Eskom.6\nThe greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the electricity generation at the wind farm will amount\nto zero. The reduction of GHG emissions as a result of the project implementation will be\nachieved due to reduction of CO2 emissions from combustion of fossil fuel at the existing grid-\nconnected powered plants and plants which would likely be built in the absence of the project.\nThe total GHG emission reductions at the end of the crediting period are expected to be\n2,867,520 t CO2e, annual average GHG emission reductions are 286,752 t CO2e\/year.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThis project falls under sectorial scope: Energy (renewable\/non-renewable).\n1 Final EIA report, Chapter 2: Project Description, page 12, November 2010\n2 Garrad Hassan, Technical Due Diligence of the De Aar Wind Farm in South Africa, Section 1:\nIntroduction, page 7, 26\/07\/2013\n3 AECOM, De Aar Maanhaarberg Wind Farm, Environmental Exclusion Zones, page 1, 13\/06\/2017\n4 EPC contract, Signature page, page 210, 06\/02\/2015\n5 Eskom, Notice of Commencement of the Facility (Maanhaarberg \u2013 96.48 MW), page 1, 30\/10\/2017\n6 http:\/\/www.sapp.co.zw, SAPP SADC Grid Map, main website page\nv3.3 3\n\n[['Organization name', None, None, 'Blue World Carbon Asset Management (Pty) Ltd (Primary project\\nProponent)'], ['', 'Contact person', '', 'Ilya Goryashin'], ['', 'Title', '', 'General Manager'], ['', 'Address', '', 'http:\/\/www.blueworldcarbon.com'], ['', 'Telephone', '', '+27790908139'], ['', 'Email', '', 'Ilya.goryashin@blueworldcarbon.com']]\n[['', 'Organization name', '', 'Longyuan Mulilo De Aar Wind Power (RF) (Pty) Ltd'], ['', 'Contact person', '', 'Bertus van Niekerk'], ['', 'Title', '', 'Project Manager'], ['Address', 'Address', None, '1st Floor, Mazars house, Rialto road, Grand Moorings Precinct, Century\\nCity, 7441'], ['', 'Telephone', '', '+27715705168'], ['', 'Email', '', 'bertus@mulilo.com']]\n[['', 'Organization name', '', 'Longyuan Mulilo De Aar Wind Power (RF) (Pty) Ltd (Longyuan Mulilo)'], ['', 'Role in the project', '', 'The project owner and the wind farm developer'], ['', 'Contact person', '', 'Bertus van Niekerk'], ['', 'Title', '', 'Project Manager'], ['Address', 'Address', None, '1st Floor, Mazars house, Rialto road, Grand Moorings Precinct, Century\\nCity, 7441'], ['', 'Telephone', '', '+27715705168'], ['', 'Email', '', 'bertus@mulilo.com']]\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nProject type is Renewable energy.

Born in Austria\nin 1920, she was one of the few women at that time to have the title of Agronomist. She moved to Brazil in\n1948 where she dedicated her professional and personal life for \u2018ecological agriculture\u2019 (agroecology)\nstudies, becoming a pioneer in the country. She taught in Brazilian Universities and became known for her\ndedication for soil science and its contribution for food production and nature resilience. Ana Maria\nPrimavesi has written many books and inspired many scientists and farm producers. Her legacy teaches\nabout the importance of learning and respecting natural resources as living organisms, nature laws and\nprocesses12.\nThe grouped project geographical scope encompasses two Brazilian biomes, that are biodiversity\nhotspots: Atlantic Forest and Cerrado,13. The present Program will be developed as a grouped project within\nBrazil\u2019s degraded land, conventional cropland, or grassland, and the purpose is to restore ecosystem\nservices and improve rural livelihoods through two main project activities: implementation of forest\nrestoration and agroforestry systems. Estimates are that Brazil has at least 200 million of hectares of\ndegraded lands spread all over its ecosystems, but more concentrated in the regions of more intense\nhuman occupation \u2013 which is the case of both Biomes. Both project activities increase carbon stocks in\nliving biomass and soil by establishing, restoring and\/or increasing vegetation cover, mainly woody\nvegetation. That said, the grouped project climate\u2019s objective consists in the increase of trees and\/or\nhectares of natural vegetation cover establishment. In addition, Ana Primavesi program aims to build the\nground for a transition to more sustainable farms and agroecological productive models in Brazil.\nFurthermore, the implementation of project activities will improve fauna and flora biodiversity since\nproject activities will be developed based on highly diverse systems, scientific and legal species\nrecommendation for each ecosystem, prioritizing endangered species whenever possible.\nIt is important to stress out that Brazil is a country of continental dimensions and with a large diversity\nof forest typologies. The forest definition broadly applicable in Brazil is that reported to the FAO for the\nGlobal Forest Resources Assessments (FRA), reproduced below: \u201cForest is defined as land spanning more\nthan 0.5 hectare with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able\nto reach these thresholds in situ. Land not classified as \u201cForest\u201d, spanning more than 0.5 hectare; with trees\nhigher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of 5-10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ; or\n12 In Ana Primavesi words: \u201cWe are aware that where technique clashes with natural laws, nature prevails and\ndominates. We must therefore recognize and accept these limits, doing as much as possible in favour of our land.\nAgriculture is beautiful and we love it even more the more we get to know nature. We ended up with the idea that the\nearth is just a food factory. The earth is not a factory and does not produce unlimitedly. Let us love our land and try to\nknow what it can produce when we treat it kindly. Everything goes better when done with love! Let us take our shovel,\nask our land what it lacks and then treat it properly within the limits that nature imposes on us, and the former\nexuberance will return to our fields and prosperity to our homes.\u201d\n13 de Lima, R.A.F., Oliveira, A.A., Pitta, G.R. et al.

Regarding communities\u2019 objectives,\nproject activities intend to increase the provision of ecosystem services within farms and communal lands,\nnotably quantity and quality of water, soil quality and protection, and biodiversity\u2019s habitats; as well as\nsupport subsistence farming and enhance food commercialization possibilities through agroforestry\nsystems. The later shall increase farmers\u2019 income; support organic and quality food production; work with\nleaders farmers, improving leadership and vocational skills; and encourage participation of women and\nyouths in decision and implementation process.\nForest restoration techniques will be implemented according to local conditions and national\nrecommendation of species for each ecosystem. On the other hand, the development of agroforestry\nsystems will consider the landowner work conditions (inputs and machinery) and desire, as well as\nenvironmental conditions, scientific and legal recommendations, and commercialization possibilities for\nchoice of species.\nThe first Project Activity Instances (PAIs) are located in Atlantic Forest and Cerrado (Brazilian savannah)\nand consists of grassland and degraded pasture to be converted into agroforestry systems and restored\nareas. Atlantic Forest and Cerrado are the two most degraded ecosystem in the country and urge the\nimplementation of forest restoration and creation and replication of new agriculture productive models. It\nis estimated that approximately 60% of Cerrado\u2019s surface suffers from some level of degradation15, and the\nsurface covered by native vegetation is subject to degrading factors or are isolated from each other16,\nreducing its resilience potential. Concerning Atlantic Forest, it is estimated that only 12% of its native\nvegetation surface is left17. For the first three PAIs, the grouped project is expected to generate 371 tCO2e\nin average per year and total of 12.988 tCO2e over 35 years for the first project instances. Overall, the\ntarget objective is to scale the project up to 2 000 hectares, totalling 10.869,62 tCO2e in average per year\nand a total of 380.437 tCO2e over 35 years.\n2.1.2 Project Scale\n14 Forest Levels Emissions Levels, 2018, Available at: https:\/\/redd.unfccc.int\/files\/2018_frel_submission_brazil.pdf\n15 Available on: http:\/\/www.observatorium.ig.ufu.br\/pdfs\/3edicao\/n7\/2.pdf\n16 Available on: https:\/\/agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br\/geral\/noticia\/2018-06\/desmatamento-e-ocupacao-desordenada-\nameacam-conservacao-do-cerrado\n17 Available on: https:\/\/cms.sosma.org.br\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Relatorio_21_julho.pdf\n14\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3","output":"{'project_name': 'Ana Primavesi \u2013 Sustainable Farming and Restoration Program', 'project_summary': 'Ana Primavesi is an initiative to support the ecological transition in the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes in Brazil.

The objective of the project, is to\ngenerate zero emission electricity to be fed into the interconnected national grid. Due to its\nsignificant contribution to climate change mitigation and sustainable development in the region, this\nproject is expected to fulfil the requirements of VCS rigorously.\nSena HEPP, which is comprised of the construction of a green field 21.4 MWe1 hydroelectric power\n2 plant located in the Aras river basin in Turkey\u2019s Eastern Anatolia Region. The plant has been\nprojected to comprise a regulator, a head race channel, a headpond, two penstocks and a power\nhouse. The power house building has been planned to consist of two units having outputs of\n10.718 MWe each.\nIt is stated in the second feasibility report dated (the most up-to-date one) April 2011 that the\nelectricity production of the proposed project is going to be 67.89 GWh\/year, with a plant load\nfactor 36%3. Throughout the report the second feasibility report results were used except for the\nIRR section where the first feasibility report dated April 2010 was used as it had been the available\none at the investment decision time. Since the project activity is a clean energy project, it reduces\ngreenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions that would have otherwise occurred in the absence of the\nproject activity by avoiding electricity generation from fossil fuel sources. In the baseline scenario,\nthe electricity delivered to the grid by the project would have otherwise been generated by the\noperation of grid-connected power plants. Since Turkey\u2019s grid mainly consists of thermal power\nplants, this would have resulted in GHG emissions. However, in the project scenario, the project\nwill generate electricity from hydro power and will result in emission reductions in parallel with its\nelectricity generation figures.The average annual emission reductions of the proposed project for\nthe crediting period are estimated to be 38,179 tonnes of CO e (tCO e). The emissions are 2 2\ncalculated by using the Turkish combined margin emission factor of 0.562 tCO \/MWh as we 2\ncomputed.\nSince the Project activity is intended to generate clean electrical energy through sustainable means\nin a system already overwhelmed by thermal power production plants, it may well be asserted that\nthe project activity shall contribute to the climate change mitigation efforts by displacing an\nequivalent amount of carbon-intensive grid electricity and reducing the dependency on fossil fuels.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThis is a voluntary project, but it follows the CDM rules.\nAccording to Annex A of the Kyoto Protocol, the Project fits in:\nSectoral Scope Number: 1\nSectoral Scope: Energy Industries -Renewable Energy\nThe project is not a grouped project.\n1 In the second feasibility report dated April 2011, the installed capacity is stated both as 22.1 MWm and 21.4 MWe\n2 http:\/\/www.eie.gov.tr\/turkce\/YEK\/HES\/hidroloji\/havzalar.html\n3 The plant load factor is not stated in the second feasibility report but is calculated as 67,890 MWh \/ 21.436 MW \/\n8,760 h = 36%.
