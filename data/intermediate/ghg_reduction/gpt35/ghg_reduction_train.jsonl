A detailed financial plan for managing the Makira project over the\nentire project period can be found in annex 6. Projections for expenses in this plan are based on the\nMakira management plan developed by WCS and approved by MEF in 2010, while expected\nrevenues are based on current negotiations with potential buyers and experience from previous sales.\nFirst sales of emission reduction carbon credits, marketed through the Conservation International\nCentre for Environmental and Leadership in Business, were approved by the Ministry of Environment,\nWater and Forests in early December 2004 and again in 2008 (cf section 1.12.3).\n1.7 Project Scale and Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals\nThe implementation of the project will generate an estimated 38,016,930 tons of CO equivalents in 2\nemission reductions (t CO -e) over the 30-year crediting period (cf. table 1). This corresponds to 2\nannual emissions reductions of 1,267,231 tons of CO equivalent per year and the Makira project can 2\ntherefore be considered as a VCS mega project (more than 1,000,000 t CO -e\/y emission reductions). 2\nIn order to account for non-permanence risks associated with the Makira AFOLU project and in\naccordance with the VCS permanence risk assessment tool, 13% of the estimated net change in the\nproject\u2019s carbon stocks (baseline stocks minus stocks in the project case) will be set aside in a risk\nbuffer account and not sold (cf. section 3.5 and annex 5). This amounts to a total set aside of\n5'517'948 tons of CO equivalents or an annual mean of 183,932 tons of CO equivalents. 2 2\nMakira Forest Protected Area Project; Project Description; version 9.0 16\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n1.8 Description of the Project Activities\n1.8.1 Identification of activities\nActivities of the project are geared towards the reduction of deforestation and forest degradation in the\nprotected area, but also in the protection zone. According to the threats analysis, the following drivers\ncan be isolated:\n1.8.1.1 Drivers of deforestation and forest degradation\n\u2022 Direct drivers of deforestation:\nConversion of forest to agricultural land (tavy) in small-scale subsistence systems. o\nConversion of forest to pastures by use of fire. o\n\u2022 Direct drivers of forest degradation:\nIllegal logging of precious timber (mainly ebony and \u201cbois de rose\u201d) o\nIllegal mining in small-scale operations o\nMore details on these drivers of deforestation and forest degradation are provided in the threat\nanalysis in section 10.3.\nBesides these direct drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, a number of factors influencing\nthe mentioned direct causes can be identified. These factors essentially determine the intensity and\nthe localisation of deforestation and forest degradation activities.\n\u2022 Main factors influencing deforestation:\nRapid population growth leads to increased land needs for subsistence agriculture and in o\nconsequence to increased deforestation.\nAccess for deforestation agents is usually easier along the forest edge and next to already o\ndeforested areas, as well as close to transport axes such as roads and forest tracks. Rivers\ndo not play a significant role in transport, as they are not navigable in the project area.\nLow agricultural productivity does not allow compensating for increased demand and leads o\nto faster agricultural rotation on deforested lands and eventually to complete abandonment\nof the lands in favour of newly deforested lands.\nInsecure land tenure leads often to \u201cprophylactic\u201d deforestation in order to gain traditional o\nland tenure without immediately using the deforested lands for agriculture.\nInsufficient control and law enforcement makes forests an open access resource which s o\nthere for the first to be taken.\nAlthough harvesting of forest products often contributes significantly to the livelihoods of o\nlocal populations, the immediate value of a standing forest is perceived smaller than the\nvalue of croplands covering more basic subsistence needs.\n\u2022 Main factors influencing forest degradation:\nRapid population growth increases the needs for local income generating activities like o\nlogging and harvesting of other forest products leading to increased forest degradation.\nRevenue of households can impact directly on forest degradation, especially if a former o\nrevenue source disappears and is replaced by illegal harvesting of high-value forest\nproducts (precious timber).\nLack of control and open access of forests exacerbated by corruption linked to the very high o\nprices achieved by precious timbers from Madagascar can increase forest degradation from\nillegal harvesting of forest products.\nMakira Forest Protected Area Project; Project Description; version 9.0 17"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2034: 2878124.0, 2033: 2810251.0, 2032: 2742378.0, 2031: 2674505.0, 2030: 2606631.0, 2029: 2062648.0, 2028: 2007344.0, 2027: 1952040.0, 2026: 1896736.0, 2025: 1841432.0, 2024: 1439436.0, 2023: 1394677.0, 2022: 1349917.0, 2021: 1305157.0, 2020: 1260397.0, 2019: 954831.0, 2018: 919426.0, 2017: 884021.0, 2016: 848616.0, 2015: 813211.0, 2014: 613035.0, 2013: 573003.0, 2012: 529796.0, 2011: 482533.0, 2010: 430086.0, 2009: 292979.0, 2008: 229815.0, 2007: 155842.0, 2006: 68060.0}"}]}

The project\u2019s contribution to the AFOLU pooled buffer\naccount is then calculated from annual project removals due to changes in soil carbon in\nproportion to the non-permanence risk rating determined using the VCS AFOLU Non-Permanence\nRisk Tool (equations 61\/62). This buffer contribution is then subtracted from net GHG emissions\nreductions and removals eligible to calculate the project\u2019s final issuance of verified carbon units\n(VCUs, VM0026 equation 60). These calculations can be found in the \u2018Ex Ante Emissions and\nRemovals\u2019 tab of the workbook \u2018MIG Validation Emissions and Removals Calculations.xlsx\u2019 and\nthey are also summarized in Table 10.\nOr\n64"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2018: 2973.536986, 2019: 34980.68433, 2020: 34734.98143, 2021: 34467.08767, 2022: 34208.15342, 2023: 33930.99606, 2024: 33673.80121, 2025: 33395.15342, 2026: 33126.32329, 2027: 32851.92427, 2028: 32602.31683, 2029: 32332.91781, 2030: 32073.00274, 2031: 31806.92929, 2032: 31565.75564, 2033: 31304.59726, 2034: 31052.76712, 2035: 30795.75703, 2036: 30561.20188, 2037: 30308.27671, 2038: 27529.83562}"}]}

The resulting waste heat would further reduce GHG\u2019s as it would replace fossil fuels so far used\nfor heating the stalls and the administration building.\nIf the proposed project is not developed, all greenhouse gases from the anaerobic lagoons will be emitted to the\natmosphere, and no emission reductions will occur.\nA.4.4.1. Estimated amount of emission reductions over the crediting period:\n>>\nAccording to the methodologies described in section B.2, the proposed project activity is expected to reduce 2.180\ntonnes of CO equivalents per annum. This would result in a total reduction of 20.430 tonnes of CO equivalents 2 2\nover the crediting period, as per the boundary definition given and thus not including e.g. reductions due to\nrenewable energy fed into the public grid system.\nFigure 7 - Estimated Emission Reductions per year\nThe emission reductions of phase 2 with the addition of a further 300 or 500 kWel generation capacity and the use of\nmore waste co-ferments is not described in the below table.\nThe project operation is scheduled to commence in several stages with the fermenters only slowly being loaded to\nfull capacity. Due to this the omitted emissions in the first year of operation do not reach the design point, mostly\nbecause the manure amount which can be handled by the plant in the initial phases is lower than the design mass\nflow after full commissioning.\nThis template shall not be altered.

Confirmation that the proposed small-scale project is not a debundled component of a larger\nproject:\n>>\nThe project participant is not participating in any other registered project activity (neither small-scale, nor large-\nscale) in the same project category or same technology\/measure. The project participant is however sharing\ninformation with a group of other biogas power plant operations on an informal basis, and some of these projects are\nsituated in the same region. But every project does have its own operator as well as its independent installation with\ndifferent technology, substrate input mix, and energy and digestate usage concept.\nBased on provisions for joint implementation small-scale projects (version 01) of the JISC, section 2.\/Debundling,\nthe project is a true stand-alone project. Hence, the project cannot be considered as being \u201cdebundled\u201d.\nA.5. Project approval by the Parties involved:\n>>\nThe stakeholder responsible for the formal approval of the biogas power plant is the provincial government of the\nProvince of North Brabant. The biogas power plant was formally and finally approved by the said authority on\nDecember 1st 2005 (date of building permission).\nOnce the draft determination report on the project activities is available, the necessary request to issue a host country\nLetter of Approval will be made to the relevant Dutch authorities. Received written approvals by the Parties\ninvolved, including the necessary acceptance of the project activities as JI project, will be attached to the final PDD.\nShould such JI approval be denied by the Dutch authorities, the carbon credits generated from the emission\nreductions verified from the project activity shall be undertaken as domestic GHG offset aiming for the voluntary\ncarbon market.\nSECTION B. Baseline\nB.1. Description and justification of the baseline chosen:\n>>\nAccording to Decision 10\/\u0421\u041c\u0420.1 paragraph 4 (a), the participants in JI projects may apply Baseline and\nMonitoring methodologies approved by the CDM Executive Board.\nTherefore, the following approved CDM baseline methodologies for small-scale project activities shall be used for\nthis project :\n\u2022 AMS-III.D Methane Recovery\n\u2022 AMS-I.C Thermal energy for the user\nThe arguments for applicability of the AMS-III.D. methodology to this small-scale JI project activity are as\nfollows:\n\u2022 The Project activity is the installation of a methane recovery and combustion system to an existing\nagricultural source of methane emissions\n\u2022 The source of the emissions is manure and agricultural wastes\n\u2022 The estimated emission reduction is less than 60.000 t CO \/a 2e\nThe arguments for applicability of the AMS-I.C. methodology to this small-scale JI project activity are as\nfollows:\n\u2022 The Project activity is the installation of a renewable energy supply device that supplies individual users\nwith thermal energy that displace fossil fuels.\n\u2022 The thermal energy is used for space and water heating\n\u2022 The generation capacity \/ the thermal capacity of the CHP motor is less than 45, and even less than 15 MWth\nThis template shall not be altered.

The annual estimated emissions reductions\nare 1358857 tonnes of CO2e.\n2\n\nVCS Project Description Template\nThe project activity falls under the Mega Project category as it exceeds the limit\nof 1,000,000 tonnes CO2 equivalent emissions reductions per year.\n1.4 A brief description of the project:\nThe project activity is Phase-I grid connected 445 MW natural gas based\nCombined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP). The power plant comprises of 2 x 140\nMW natural gas-run turbines, two heat recovery steam generators and a 165 MW\nsteam turbine. It is a green field project developed by Konaseema Gas Power\nLtd, hereinafter called KGPL, located at East Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh,\nIndia.\nThe generated power will be exported to the Andhra Pradesh power grid (part of\nthe southern grid of India) and this is ensured by the Power Purchase Agreement\n(PPA) signed with State government owned Andhra Pradesh Transmission\nCorporation of India Ltd. (APTRANSCO). The project activity will meet the\nbase load requirement of the southern grid.\nIn the absence of the project activity the same quantity of power would have\nbeen produced from Green House Gases (GHGs) intensive fossil fuel i.e coal.\nSince natural gas is energy intensive fuel it emits less GHGs comparatively for\nthe same quantity of power generated using coal. Thus the project activity would\nhelp in reducing GHGs emissions into the atmosphere by the combustion of\nrelatively cleaner fuel.\nThe project activity involves highly sophisticated and technologically superior\nequipment, for example the gas turbine is equipped with hybrid burners that emit\nlow NOx and it has got extended maintenance intervals which means increased\navailability of the equipment.\n1.5 Project location including geographic and physical information allowing\nthe unique identification and delineation of the specific extent of the\nproject:\nThe project site is at Devarapalli village (Latitude: 17\u00b0 01\u201f 60\u201f N; Longitude:\n81\u00b0 32\u201f 60\u201f E) which is located in Kothapeta Mandal at a distance of 4 km\nfrom Ravulapalem. The site is located adjacent to the highway connecting\nRajahmundry and Amalapuram. The nearest town is Rajahmundry, which is at a\ndistance of 35 km and is well connected with major cities like Hyderabad,\nChennai, Calcutta, and Visakhapatnam by rail and road. Nearest Airport to the\nplant is Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh.\n3"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2019: 1358857.0, 2018: 1358857.0, 2017: 1358857.0, 2016: 1358857.0, 2015: 1358857.0, 2014: 1358857.0, 2013: 1358857.0, 2012: 1358857.0, 2011: 1358857.0, 2010: 1358857.0, 2009: 1358857.0}"}]}

Furthermore, as mentioned\nin section 4.4.1.1, the total uncertainty in the combined carbons stocks and greenhouse gas sources in\nthe REDD baseline was determined to be 10.61%. Therefore, the cumulative uncertainty in the REDD\nbaseline scenario is 10.61%. The Ex Post uncertainty in the REDD project scenario was set to zero,\nsince no ex post (re-)measurements of carbon pools or GHG sources have been made. Uncertainties\nwill be reassessed when carbon pools are re-measured.\n5.6.1.2 WRC Uncertainty\nUsing the standard error data for the peat emission factors provided by the IPCC (IPCC Wetlands\nSupplement 2013, see Appendix 6) the uncertainties of CO and CH emissions from microbial 2 4\ndecompositions of peat and Dissolved Organic Carbon from water bodies were calculated in both the\nbaseline and project scenario. The uncertainty of CH emissions from water body was set to zero since 4\nit was conservatively excluded from all emission calculations. The uncertainty of GHG emissions from\nuncontrolled peat burning in the project scenario was also set to zero as it was assumed all fires in the\nproject will be prevented. The uncertainty in GHG emissions from peat burning in the baseline scenario\nwas calculated using the dry mass burnt per stratum per year and their standard errors. Since module\nX-UNC doesn\u2019t distinguish between CO and CH emissions from peat burning, emissions from the data 2 4\nwas combined to produce an overall uncertainty in CO equivalent.

The\nproject activity entails installation of two turbine of capacity 43 MW each along with other auxiliary\ndevices implemented at village Jari, Kullu District, Himachal Pradesh. The project activity has the\ncapacity to generate about 370 million KWh per annum and this estimation is based on 95%\npower plant availability for a 90% dependable year based on the hydrological data for the last 24\nyears provided by the Government of Himachal Pradesh. And average power generation based\non actual data of last 10 year is about 320 million KWh per annum. The generated power, after\nmeeting the auxiliary power requirements, the net billable power will is injected to Bajaura\nSubstation which is the part of NEWNE grid.\nThe purpose of the project activity is to generate electricity by using the renewable energy\nsources (water) for a grid system in the state of Himachal Pradesh, India. In the absence of the\nproject activity, equivalent power would have been generated based on the fossil fuel intensive\ngrid. The project activity displaces electricity and green house gases (GHG) emissions currently\nproduced by thermal fossil fuel-burning facilities from the NEWNE grid.\nThis whole process will support climate change mitigation as it would lead to an emission\nreduction of 2755320 tonnes of CO e over the chosen crediting period. 2\nLifetime of the project activity is expected to be 40 years.\n1.9 Project Location\nThe project is located at Jari village in district Kullu of Himachal Pradesh around 25 Km from\nBhunter. The Project activity is uniquely identified as Malana Hydro Project in the region. The\nnearest railway station from the project site is Kiratpur Sahib, about 198 Km from Bhunter.\nBhunter has airport and is well connected to Delhi.\nv3.0 7\n\n\n[['Years', '', 'Estimated', '', '', 'Estimated', '', 'Estimated\\nleakage\\nemissions\\n(tCO e),LEy\\n2', '', 'Estimated net', ''], [None, None, 'baseline', None, None, 'project', None, None, None, 'GHG emission', None], [None, None, 'emissions or', None, None, 'emissions or', None, None, None, 'reductions or', None], [None, None, 'removals', None, None, 'removals', None, None, None, 'removals', None], [None, None, '(tCO e), BEy\\n2', None, None, '(tCO e), PEy\\n2', None, None, None, '(tCO e), ERy\\n2', None], ['2011-12', '275532', None, None, '0', None, None, '0', '275532', None, None], ['2012-13', '275532', None, None, '0', None, None, '0', '275532', None, None], ['2013-14', '275532', None, None, '0', None, None, '0', '275532', None, None], ['2014-15', '275532', None, None, '0', None, None, '0', '275532', None, None], ['2015-16', '275532', None, None, '0', None, None, '0', '275532', None, None], ['2016-17', '275532', None, None, '0', None, None, '0', '275532', None, None], ['2017-18', '275532', None, None, '0', None, None, '0', '275532', None, None], ['2018-19', '275532', None, None, '0', None, None, '0', '275532', None, None], ['2019-20', '275532', None, None, '0', None, None, '0', '275532', None, None], ['2020-21', '275532', None, None, '0', None, None, '0', '275532', None, None], ['Total', '2755320', None, None, '', None, None, '', '2755320', None, None]]\n[['', 'Data Unit \/ Parameter:', '', 'EF\\nBM ,grid, y'], ['', 'Data unit:', '', 'tCO \/MWh\\n2'], ['Description:', 'Description:', None, 'The Build Margin emission factor for year 2009-10 of\\nNEWNE grid'], ['', 'Source of data:', '', 'CEA CO Baseline Database, version 06\\n2'], ['', 'Value applied:', '', '0.812'], ['', 'Justification of choice of data', '', 'The value is taken from the database developed by Central\\nElectricity Authority (CO Baseline database for the Indian\\n2\\npower sector, Version 6.0).

On the other hand, the project activity\nwill improve the local environmental conditions by establishing proper treatment for the renewable\nbiomasses and also by contributing to the reduction of the deforestation rate.\nTable 19. Summary of the environmental impacts\nEnvironmental Laws related to the plant activities\nThe Environmental National Policy, Pol\u00edtica Nacional do Meio Ambiente - PNMA, instituted by the\nBrazilian Law 6.938\/81, establishes that the construction, installation, amplification and operation of any\nenterprise or activity which may exploit natural resources, and are considered potentially pollutant, or\ncapable of degrading the environment, will be possible only if they obtain a previous environmental\npermission; according to the Brazilian Constitution of 1988. One of the tools settled by the PNMA, in order\nto monitor and study the potential impacts generated by these kinds of enterprises, is the Environmental\nImpact Assessment (EIA).\nAn EIA was not required due to the project activity.\nIn addition, the project activity will contribute to the sustainable development of the host country, such as:\n- The use of clean and efficient technologies through the use of biomass waste as fuel. By these means, the\nproject is in accordance to Agenda 21 and with Brazilian Sustainable Development Criteria;\n- A pioneer initiative that encourages throughout the country the development of new technologies that\nsubstitutes the use of usual fuels for renewable biomass which presents an efficient thermal energy\ngeneration potential as shown in the project demonstration.\n46\n\nGE Teobaldo Ceramic - VCS Project Description\n6 Stakeholders comments:\nThe main stakeholders considered in this project are the ceramic industry labour union (SINDICER)112 and\nthe ceramic company employees. A letter was sent to the stakeholders informing about the project. In the\nceramic\u2019s facilities, the letter was posted on the employees\u2019 board which is a visible place with high\ncirculation of employees. The letter was available during 7 days and the comments were expected for a\nperiod of 7 days after the letter has been posted.\nSINDICER sent a letter stating their support to the ceramic of the present project activity on May 28th,\n2009113.\nIn addition, having the ceramic sector association being aware of the project, other local stakeholders will\nbe able to be informed about the proposed project activities, because the ceramic sector association has\ngreat visibility trough different parts of the community, public entities on different levels, like\nMunicipality, State and Federal organizations.\nThe ceramic sector association keeps relationships to local developing agencies, like SEBRAE (Brazilian\nService to support Micro and Small size companies), SENAI (Brazilian Service to support technically\nManufacturing Companies), among others so it will help in the diffusion of project results and practices.\nTill validation time, positive answers were received and the outcomes are available and arrived within the\nvalidation of the project.\n112 This institution is focused in the quality and sustainable management, offering opportunities for the ceramists, their\nbusiness and employees as a result of its services, researches, events and associations.\n113 The letter from SINDICER was evidenced to the DOE.\n47\n\n[['Ceramic', 'Project Start Date'], ['GE Teobaldo', 'October 2008']]\nGE Teobaldo Ceramic - VCS Project Description\n7 Schedule:\n\uf0b7 Project start date: Date on which the project began reducing or removing GHG emissions, i.e. when\nthe project proponent began utilizing renewable biomass.\nTable 20.

Briefly, equations 23, 24 and 25 reflect a deviation in tree height and crown area field\nmeasurements, neither of which was used in direct biomass estimation. Tree biomass was estimated using\nthe Broadbent et al. (2008) regression equation (deviation in eq. 28 and 30) using tree crown areas digitized\nin virtual plots. This model performed better than the allometric model using site\u2010specific data. Biomass\nestimates were then adjusted downward to match ground\u2010based biomass estimates, which are lower than\nIPCC default values for tropical moist forest.\nThe deviation in AIM steps had a negligible effect on baseline calculations since methods used are\nconsistent with prescribed methods.

If this leakage assessment quantifies a portion of\nnon-renewable biomass saved under the project activity that is used as\nthe baseline of other project activity then baseline is adjusted to\naccount for the quantified leakage.\n- Increase in the use of non-renewable biomass outside the project\nboundary to create non-renewable biomass baselines can also be\npotential source of leakage. If this leakage assessment quantifies an\nincrease in use of non-renewable biomass outside the project boundary\nthen baseline is adjusted to account for the quantified leakage.\nIt is expected that the carbon credits incomes will stimulate the use\nof renewable biomass to other ceramic companies presenting a huge\npossibility for sustainable development in the region. Therefore, the\nsources of leakages mentioned above will probably not be applicable as\nit is predicted the project activity will not displace the use of\nrenewable biomass of a non-project user, due to the likely decrease in\nthe use of non-renewable biomass in the region and there is current\ngreat amount of renewable biomasses available locally as described\nbefore. The non-renewable biomass employed which would be employed in\nthis project activity will not be saved for other project activity,\nsince other ceramics was already consuming wood from non sustainable\nforest management (common practice).\nIt will decrease the using of non-renewable biomass, especially due to\nthe incentive of carbon credits.\nTherefore, it can be concluded that this source of leakage, until the\ndate of the project approval, is not considered in this project\nactivity.\nC) If the equipment is transferred from another activity\nor if the existing equipment is transferred to another\nactivity, leakage is to be considered.\nThis leakage is not applicable for this project activity at Ituiutaba\nCeramic as there is no transference of equipment, in spite of new\nequipments had to be acquired.\nDue to all the explanations described above, the present project\nactivity, until the date of the project approval, does not encompass\nany type of leakage.\n4.2 Quantifying GHG emissions and\/or removals for the\nbaseline scenario:\nThe applied methodology does not predict project emissions; therefore, the\nbaseline emissions are equivalent to emission reductions, which is demonstrated\nbelow.\nBy,total = 15,181 tons of ceramic units per year x 0.769 tons of wood\/ton of\nceramic units = 11,674 tons of wood per year\nERy, total = 11,674 tons of wood x 0.9803 x 0.0186 TJ\/Ton x 77.4 tCO2\/TJ =\n16,475 tCOe 2\nTable 16.

For\nexample, if the owner of a farm is also the farmer operating the farm, this farmer is authorized to sign\nthe agreement. On the other hand, when the owner leases the farm to a different farmer to operate it,\nthe structure of the leasing contract determines credit ownership. If the leasing contract makes an\nexplicit indication of the rights to the carbon credits being transferred along with the lease to the farmer\noperating the farm for at least the total duration of the longevity of the project, then the lessee farmer\nmay sign the agreement with Boomitra. Otherwise, the owner must sign the agreement with Boomitra.\n1.8 Project Start Date\nProject Start Date: February 1, 2018\nThe Project start date is February 1, 2018, the approximate time of adoption of the project activities by\nthe first farmers participating in the program, under the educational guidance of ground staff. This start\ndate is substantiated by activity records and farmer engagement records from the ground staff dating\nfrom the start date. It is also substantiated by signed attestations by the farmers of their previous\npractices and transitions to new practices and\/or expanded practices. The project activities initiated by\nfarmers on the land at the start date include the collection of crop residues from the previous growing\nseason for the purposes of improved residue management, in the form of composting and mulching. As\nper the VCS Standard, the date of the start of these crop residue management activities in this project\nconstitutes the date when activities leading to GHG reductions and removals are implemented, and is\nthus the right choice for the start date of the grouped project.\n1.9 Project Crediting Period\nThe duration of the VCS project crediting period is initially 20 years with a possibility for renewal four\ntimes.

SIL is a part of Chennai based Surana group.\nThe Surana Group comprises of Surana Industries and Surana Corporation,\ndedicated to steel manufacturing, jewellery manufacturing and power\ngeneration. Surana Industries Limited has an integrated steel\nManufacturing plant at Gummidipoondi, TamilNadu; an integrated steel\nmanufacturing plant is under implementation at Raichur, Karnataka and\nthey also generate power for captive consumption.\nPurpose of the project activity\nThe purpose of the project activity is renewable electricity generation\nby using a zero carbon intensive source i.e. wind energy in a 12 MW\nwind farm by M\/s Surana Industries Limited.\nDescription of the project\nThe proposed project activity of SIL involves generation, operation and\nmaintenance of wind energy generators at Radhapuram3, Tirunelveli in the\nstate of Tamil Nadu. The proposed project consists of 8 wind turbines\neach with a capacity of 1.5 MW and aims at generating 12 MW of\nelectricity from wind energy. Out of the 12 MW of the power generated\nat the wind farm, 3MW (from two turbines of 1.5 MW each) is proposed to\nbe sold to the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) grid. The rest 9 MW\n(from 6 turbines of 1.5 MW) is proposed to be used for captive\nconsumption after wheeling and banking with TNEB, in SIL\u2019s factory at\nGummipundi.\nThe entire energy generated is evacuated through external overhead\nlines and these lines run through 12 km and are connected to the\nKottaikarungulam substation.\nBaseline scenario\nIn the absence of the project activity equivalent amount of electricity\nwould have been generated by the operation of grid connected fossil\nfuel based power plants or fossil fuel based captive power plant. The\nProject activity will thus reduce the anthropogenic emissions of\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) into the atmosphere associated with the equivalent\namount of electricity generation from the fossil fuel based grid\nconnected power plant.\n1.5 Project location including geographic and physical information\nallowing the unique identification and delineation of the specific\nextent of the project:\n3 Refer Annex 1 for details of the WTGs in the project activity\n3"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2031: 1721159.0, 2030: 1671854.0, 2029: 1622549.0, 2028: 1573244.0, 2027: 1511065.0, 2026: 1463221.0, 2025: 1417780.0, 2024: 1366883.0, 2023: 1321486.0, 2022: 1060113.0, 2021: 845291.0, 2020: 730710.0, 2019: 332621.0}"}]}

All lands belonging to the Project are not located within a jurisdiction covered\nby a jurisdictional REDD+ program. The activities planned shall seek to promote ecological connectivity,\nhabitat management, biodiversity conservation, and poverty alleviation in the area. These goals will be\nachieved by establishing forest corridors using native tree species. The Project will reduce the pressure\non the remaining natural forests and support passive forest protection in the region.\nThe main goals of the Project are: a) improve connectivity and \/ or continuity of forest cover to achieve\npositive outcomes for biodiversity at the community and landscape levels; b) improve rural incomes; c)\nimprove the conditions of conservation and protected area management at the regional level, including\nbetter community resilience to climate change; d) mitigate climate change; e) recover watersheds; and f)\nreduce erosion.\nTo achieve the above goals, the following activities are allowed under the proposed grouped project:\na. Restoring degraded lands for conservation\nb. Restoring degraded lands using agroforestry practices\nRestoring degraded lands for conservation \u2013 activities that involve planting native tree species on non-\nforest lands for the purpose of forest conservation falls under this category. Areas under the Project will\nprotect the selected area for the duration of the Project and beyond, retaining the carbon contained in\nthe existing biomass and sequester additional carbon in the recovered forests.\nThis project seeks to establish, in the first activity instances, 626.29 hectares of forest plantations. The\nProject uses site preparation and tree planting to establish native trees on degraded lands.

The project\narea has a cold temperate zone continental monsoon climate feature, the elevation level is\nbetween 700m and 1,500m, the annual precipitation level is 400-500 mm, while the annual\nevaporation is 1,041.2 mm. As the forest coverage rate is 83.37%, the primary business within\nthe project area is forest industry .The existing commercial forest was mainly comprised of Brich\nand Pinus, all the tree species are native to the project area. According to the timber production\nplan approved by Chao\u2019er forest industry Co., Ltd, prior to the project implementation, all timber\nlogging including commercial harvest & tending and managing was planned annually at the\nbeginning of every year. The harvested trees will be transported to the local lumber market. From\n2010 of the project implementation, the commercial harvest has been cancelled and only tending\nand managing is allowed.\nThe project will converse 11,010ha forest from logged to protected, it is located in Wuyi Forestry\nCentre, a forest centre affiliated to Chao\u2019er forest bureau. The project activity will significantly\nimprove the forest management conditions within the project area, and benefit local ecological\nenvironment. The implementation of the project will not only achieve a reliable measurable\ncarbon sequestration by reducing commercial timer, but also contribute to sustainable\ndevelopment of the local community, host country by means of:\n\uf0d8 As one of the most precious ecological resources, forest is key to biodiversity and all life\nforms. The protection of local forest will enrich the biodiversity and provide more opportunity\nfor adaptive response to natural challenges and economic development (e.g. climate change\nand new medical discoveries);\n\uf0d8 Offer job opportunities. Instead of casual labour demand for forest timber (once a year or\nseveral years), the protected forest will create some employment opportunities for forest\nmanagement. The related training process will improve the skill of the local employees.\n\uf0d8 Meet the strategy development plan of host country and local area. After the implementation\nof the project, the increasing forest coverage rate will benefit the local environmental\ncondition by producing more oxygen and absorb more greenhouse gas.\nThe land parcels of the project are listed as follow:\nOf its 11,010 ha forest land, the brich area is 1,313 ha, and pinus is 9,697 ha, covering a\ndominant percentage, and also a very small fraction of aspen and willow.\nv3.2 6"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2014: 99250.61, 2013: 100282.99, 2012: 101315.37, 2011: 102347.75, 2010: 103380.13}"}]}

If the indicators were less than 10%, leakage is set to zero. The\nmonitoring results provided in the PD indicated cropland and grazing leakage is below the\nthresholds that require further monitoring and that the ex-post leakage can be set at zero.\n5.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\nThe net change in carbon stocks during the monitoring period was -48,837 tCO2e. The net\nGhG emissions reductions can be found at the bottom of the \"PA Summary\" worksheet. It\nreflects the emission reductions calculated from the \"Ex-Post Strata\" worksheet, less the\nPending and Removed PAs.\nTwo non-permanence risk reports were prepared under Section 2.1.3 of the AFOLU Non-\nPermanence Risk Tool, v4.0. Due to the harvesting reported in this PD and the Loss\nReport, 12 PAs were evaluated separately from the remainder. That risk report, Non-\nPermanence Risk Sub-Report KE001-L, failed. But for the reversal in KE001-L, there\nwould have been an increase of 19,505 tonnes in the remainder of the PD and the risk\nreport for the remaining PAs had a risk of 1.0.

Although the land owner was under contract to\nmaintain the trees for 60 years, the family violated the contract and cut down the trees.\nThere were 168,169 trees, in 12 PAs, present during the second verification that covered\nthe monitoring period 01-January-11 to 11-August-2015. This represented 68,342 VCUs that\nwere issued and subsequently sold (less the buffer). While preparing the monitoring reports for\nthe third verification, this loss was first recognized and triggered further investigation on the\nground. The loss of the 68,342 tonnes of removal has been confirmed and has caused a\n48,837 tonne loss for the third monitoring period, 12-August-2015 to 22-May-2020.\n1.2 Date of Loss Event\n12-August-2015 to 22-May-2020\n1.3 Location of Loss Event\nThe PAs are located in the vicinity of Nkubu, Kenya, in Meru County, on the east flank of\nMt.

However, the primary data were obtained only in Cujubim, and the secondary data were\nobtained in the other three municipalities. This choice was made because there is a social and economic\nrelationship between Manoa Farm and the municipality of Cujubim, due to access to the area, the\ncreation of jobs and the destination of raw material (wood), and the fact that the activities of the\ndeforestation agents mainly occur based in the Cujubim region.\nIn addition to the aforementioned relationships, it is also noteworthy that: a) access to the area is\nvia Cujubim; b) the area is contiguous to protected areas, known as Conservation Units, along several\nsegments of its boundaries; c) the settlements for agrarian reform (considered vectors of deforestation)\nare located in the section between Cujubim and Manoa Farm; d) all other areas are forested, privately\nheld, and used for management plans; e) the areas called \u201ct\u00edtulos antigos dos soldados da borracha\u201d\n[literally: \u201cold titles of the rubber soldiers\u201d] are located in the municipality of Cujubim, being used for Forest\nManagement.\nv3.0\n169"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2042: 302499.0, 2041: 326007.0, 2040: 263692.0, 2039: 375768.0, 2038: 374893.0, 2037: 311645.0, 2036: 271125.0, 2035: 304156.0, 2034: 350578.0, 2033: 368358.0, 2032: 349362.0, 2031: 338505.0, 2030: 298158.0, 2029: 355865.0, 2028: 345411.0, 2027: 324113.0, 2026: 329351.0, 2025: 309770.0, 2024: 377742.0, 2023: 301007.0, 2022: 244330.0, 2021: 248388.0, 2020: 217979.0, 2019: 246298.0, 2018: 166406.0, 2017: 230786.0, 2016: 112698.0, 2015: 150485.0, 2014: 132418.0, 2013: 50904.0}"}]}

Category(ies) of project activity:\nAccording to Annex A of the Kyoto Protocol, this project fits in Sectoral Scope 01 (Energy industries \u2013\nrenewable\/non-renewable sources). In addition, according to the project categories defined under VCS\nversion 1 eligible under VCU verification criteria, this project fits into Category 1. Renewable Energy\nA.4.3. Technology to be employed by the project activity:\nThe project activity consists of installation of new equipment that will allow the project developer to\nproduce steam only from biomass residues. These biomass residues will be either a by-product from the\nproject developer core business or bought from third parties (located near the project site). The residues\nwill be burned in the new biomass boiler to produce high-pressure steam. As the production process of\nthe project developer only demands low-pressure steam, a turbine will be installed complementarily to the\nboiler in order to generate electricity from the high pressure steam. This electrical energy will be used in\nthe production process, as well as in other day-to-day activities, displacing grid-generated electricity.\nThe new equipment included in the Project activity consists of the installation of:\n1. A new biomass boiler with capacity of 60 tonnes of steam\/hour; manufactured by Equipalcool,\nmodel 60-v-2-s;\n2. 1 Turbine manufactured by TGM and 1 generator WEG with an installed capacity of 8 MW;\nThis boiler was designed to be fuelled with biomass residues only. It is not expected that any fossil fuel\nwill be used as auxiliary fuel or start up fuel. The lifetime of the old boilers was estimated according to\nthe Brazilian Regulatory Norm number 131. Inspections were carried out to evaluate the actual condition\nof the boilers and was verified that, after undergoing minor repairs, the equipment had a remaining\nlifetime of greater than 30 years.\nAll the equipment and maintenance labour is done by Brazilians. The technology and know-how being\npromoted by this project is environmentally safe and sound, and will further promote such activities in the\nfuture.\nA.4.4 Estimated amount of emission reductions over the crediting period:\nTable - estimated emissions reductions from the project\n1 From Portuguese, Norma Regulamentadora n\u00ba13, from the Brazilian Labour and Employment Ministry.

The total capacity\nof the project is 480 MW. The project is promoted by Azure Power India Pvt ltd with different\nSPVs. The project activity would use solar energy to generate direct current form photovoltaic\nmodules that will be converted into alternating current by inverters. The project activity will install\na new power plant (i.e. solar PV) at a site where no renewable power plant was operating prior to\nthe implementation of the project activity (green-field plant). The generated electricity will be\nsupplied to grid. The project activity follows ACM0002 Version 19.0.\nBaseline Scenario:\nAs per the applicable methodology, a Greenfield power plant is defined as \u201ca new renewable\nenergy power plant that is constructed and operated at a site where no renewable energy power\nplant was operated prior to the implementation of the project activity\u201d.\nAs the project activity falls under the definition of a Greenfield power plant, the baseline scenario\nas per applied methodology is the following:\nThe baseline scenario is that the electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have\notherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of\nnew generation sources into the grid. Hence, pre-project scenario and baseline scenario are the\nsame. The estimated lifetime of the project activity is considered as 25 years for solar technology.\nThis may increase depending on the operation & maintenance of the plant. The Project activity is\na new facility (Greenfield) and the electricity generated by the Project will be exported to the\nIndian Grid. The Project will therefore displace an equivalent amount of electricity which would\nhave otherwise been generated by fossil fuel dominant electricity grid. The Project Proponent\nplans to avail the VCS benefits for the Project.\nEmission Reductions from anthropogenic sources:\nThe solar power generated from the Project will be displacing the electricity generated from\nthermal power stations feeding into Indian grid and will be replacing the usage of diesel\ngenerators for meeting the power demand during shortage periods. Since, the solar power is\nGreen House Gas (GHG) emissions free, the power generated will prevent the anthropogenic\nGHG emissions generated by the fossil fuel based thermal power stations comprising coal,\ndiesel, furnace oil and gas. The estimation of GHG reductions by this project is limited to carbon\ndioxide (CO ) only. 2\nThe commissioning details of the project are as follows:\nv3.1 6"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2026: 852639.0, 2025: 852639.0, 2024: 852639.0, 2023: 852639.0, 2022: 852639.0, 2021: 852639.0, 2020: 852639.0, 2019: 852639.0, 2018: 852639.0, 2017: 852639.0}"}]}

The baseline scenario is\nunconstrained by these barriers \u2013 and is in fact driven by this lack of governance and social\npressures.\n5 QUANTIFICATION OF GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND REMOVALS\n5.1 Project Scale and Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals\nTable 24.

Most of the project activities detailed in table 4 is mainly implemented in the\nleakage management area as well as in the project area as identified by the project proponent and\nrelevant stakeholders. The activities implemented in the leakage management area are in partnership\nwith the agents of the drivers of deforestation.\nThe activities planned to be implemented in the leakage management area\/s to avoid leakage are:\n1. Agricultural intensification and provision of economic alternatives to ensure the well-\nbeing of local communities: This activity is implemented as part of intensifying agricultural\nactivities to avoid the expansion of agricultural land into forest. The major activities will be\nsupport annual individual kebele-level performance grants; support livestock and range\nmanagement measures; support poultry farming activities; support improved cereals and fruit\ntree crop activities;\nThe expected outcomes of such activities implementation are Increase productivity of\nagricultural and decrease forest encroachment. Deforestation and forest degradation\ndecreases rural community household income increased;\n2. Provision of alternative fuel wood and construction poles supply from non-forest\nlands: This is to avoid the continuous cutting of trees from the REDD+ project area for the\npurpose of community fuelwood consumption and for house construction. The project is\nplanning to closely work with rural households to establish plantations, assist establishment of\ncommunity woodlots, improved stoves dissemination to satisfy the fuelwood and construction\nwood demand.\nThe distribution of the fuel efficient cookstoves is mainly to reduce the amount of fuel\nconsumption by rural and urban households in and surrounding the REDD+ project areas.\nThe distribution of the cookstove will be in the leakage management area surrounding the\nproject area\/s. 12,000 Cook stoves has been distributed which reduces the use of the wood\nby 50%.\n3. Implementation of Sustainable Forest management and strengthening enforcement of\npolicies and laws: This is to support and strengthen PFM cooperatives, enhanced forest\npatrols to reduce illegal activities; implement forest fire prevention activities. The existing\nforest law will be enforced against illegal expansion of agricultural land into forest to avoid\nactivity leakage in to the leakage belt.\n88"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2031: 1308481.34, 2030: 1327987.74, 2029: 1348068.18, 2028: 1368666.03, 2027: 1389882.28, 2026: 1411721.87, 2025: 1434206.99, 2024: 1457421.39, 2023: 1481347.84, 2022: 1030872.74, 2021: 1282378.08, 2020: 1304008.16, 2019: 1326324.9, 2018: 1349414.37, 2017: 1373330.63, 2016: 1075455.16, 2015: 1095207.43, 2014: 1115678.86, 2013: 1136938.74, 2012: 1159028.68}"}]}

Planting activities that changing barren land\nsuch as this project is not eligible for the subsidy. Different from forestry in other provinces, forest in\nGuizhou Province is mainly Public welfare forest and stone desertification control forest land.30\nThere were some afforestation and reforestation in the project regions on lands similar to the degraded\nlands of the proposed A\/R CDM project activity, but this in small scales. In Guizhou Province, the\nafforestation activities were was mainly established several years ago by a small number of relatively\nwealthy communities and villagers at a time when there were not many alternative investment\nopportunities. As it was not profitable and there was little market incentive, the activities could not be\nextended by investors. As the forestry industry has developed rapidly in recent years in Guizhou and the\ncost of labour and planting materials including seedling and fertilizers has increased significantly, the\nvillagers and forest companies turn to plant short-rotation and fast-growth species in accessible areas\nrather than planting long-term local species in remote, degraded land, which is not economically\nattractive, due to slow tree growth, low land productivity and high transportation costs. Also, in recent\nyears, large increases in the price of seedling and fertilizers, as well as the cost of labor, has greatly\nreduced the expected economic return.\nAll the above reasons explain that it is very difficult to conduct afforestation activity in these two counties.\nSo that\u2019s why there is no similar afforestation activity in the Guizhou Province. Since there is no similar\nafforestation activity within the common practice boundary, there is no need to conduct common practice\nanalysis for this project. No similar projects in Guizhou Province have successfully applied for CDM\nprojects or CCER projects\nThus, the proposed project is not a common practice.\n3.1.5 Additionality\nAdditionality has been fully analyzed in the above section 3.1.4 Baseline Scenario with \u201cCombined tool to\nidentify the baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality in A\/R CDM project activities\u201d (Version 01).\nBased on above demonstration, the proposed project is additional.\n3.1.6 Methodology Deviations\nNo deviations from the procedures indicated by the methodology have been made.\n3.2 Quantification of GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\n3.2.1 Baseline Emissions\nBaseline net GHG removals by sinks\n30 http:\/\/www.gywb.cn\/content\/2014-12\/10\/content_2003257.htm\nCCB v3.0, VCS 48"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2014: 1961.917808, 2015: 5461.344487, 2016: 12087.68291, 2017: 22503.23288, 2018: 36941.36986, 2019: 55243.62692, 2020: 77653.56486, 2021: 102995.1507, 2022: 131213.3425, 2023: 161218.8764, 2024: 193757.9181, 2025: 226104.0548, 2026: 259048.411, 2027: 291071.4467, 2028: 324145.7313, 2029: 354143.726, 2030: 383173.5068, 2031: 409470.891, 2032: 436243.7118, 2033: 458175.6027, 2034: 478590.137, 2035: 495535.4747, 2036: 513122.1143, 2037: 525175.7534, 2038: 535874.137, 2039: 543134.6811, 2040: 551549.36, 2041: 554485.1507, 2042: 556559.4521, 2043: 555634.182, 2044: 138420.4481}"}]}

As demonstrated in Section 3.1 of the VCS PD, the\nchange in baseline carbons stocks is below the threshold that would require monitoring. Because\nonly the trees planted as part of the project are counted in the estimation of project removals, the\nbaseline carbon stocks are fixed at zero.\n3.2.2 Project Emissions\nEmissions Caused by the Project\nThe emissions caused by the Project are considered zero. As addressed in the PD, this is due to\nthe manner in which the Project is operated, such as: no vehicles, manual labor conducted by the\nsmall-hold farmers on their own land, restrictions on chemical fertilizers, no clearing of baseline\ntrees and minimal disturbance of the ground for planting.\nProject Removal Calculations\nThe following provides the step-by-step procedure used to determine the Project GHG removals:\nStep 1. Because of the difference in species and age of the trees and location, ownership and\nmanagement of the project areas, each project area is monitored. They are documented in the\n\"PA Summary\" worksheet of Appendix 14. The location of each PA was obtained with a GPS and\nis also provided in the \"PA Summary\" worksheet of Appendix 14. The boundary of each project\narea was obtained using a GPS and provided in PD Appendix 03. The area was calculated and\nis listed with each project area in the \"PA Summary\" worksheet of Appendix 14.\nStep 2. The strata for the ex post estimation of the actual net greenhouse gas removals was\ndone by species and year similar to the ex-ante estimate as described in PD Section 3.2.\nStratification was done within each individual project area. The area of a stratum in a project area\n(\"Area of a Stratum (ha)\") was determined by multiplying the area of project area (see Step 1) by\nthe percentage of trees of that stratum in the respective project area. The results are provided in\nthe \"Ex post Strata\" worksheet of Appendix 14.\nStep 3. Where a tree species exceeded 10% of the total tree inventory, it was assigned to a\nMajor Strata. All other tree species were assigned to an \"Other\" strata. Based on the tabulations\nin Appendix 14, there are four major strata: eucalyptus, grevillea, cypress and other.\nStep 4. Step 4. Allometric equations were used to convert DBH values to biomass. An\nallometric equation for each Major Strata was identified. If a species specific equation for a Major\nStrata was unavailable, it used the \"Other\" equation as a default. Allometric equations were\nresearched and the most appropriate ones identified by the Proponent were assigned to the\nmajor strata. Because no better allometric equation could be found for grevillea and cypress,\nthey were assigned to the \"other\" equation. The following is the assignment.\nEucalyptus42: Log Y = -2.43 + 2.58 Log C\n42 DH Ashton, \u201cThe Development of Even-aged Stands in Eucalyptus regnans F.

However, the annual report that AMPA\nmust present to demonstrate that they are doing activities in accordance with the concession purpose will\ninclude the monitoring of activities implemented to avoid GHG emissions due to deforestation and forest\ndegradation. Therefore, when possible, the implementation will be monitored yearly.\nMonitoring of land-use and land-cover change\nMonitoring of land-use and land-cover change will be done yearly using Measurement Reporting and\nVerification (MRV) data generated by the Peruvian government. Forest land cover for the period 2000 \u2013 2017\nis already available at the Geobosques\u2019s website, and it is updated yearly.\nIf the information generated by the Peruvian government is not available for any given year at the time of\nmonitoring, the analysis of change in land use will be done by the project implementer following the\nmethodology used for the construction of the FREL and the Descriptive Memory of the Forest\/Non-forest\nMap (Vargas Gonz\u00e1les et al., 2014).\nMonitoring of carbon stocks and non-CO emissions 2\nAccording to the methodology, monitoring of carbon stocks is mandatory within the project area If there are\nareas subject to controlled deforestation, and if planned harvest or uncontrolled forest fires or other\ncatastrophic events occur, otherwise the average will not change. This project does not consider controlled\ndeforestation or planned harvesting, so carbon stocks will be monitored only in the case of catastrophic event\nhappens.\nv3.3 56\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nMonitoring of impacts of natural disturbances and other catastrophic events\nAs stated previously, if a catastrophic event happens, the areas affected will be monitored to verify carbon\nstock losses.\nMonitoring of leakage\nAs mentioned in section 2.6, there is no leakage area, nor monitoring of it.\nEx-post net anthropogenic GHG emission reductions\nEx-post estimation in the project area will be summarized using the same table format (Table 36 of the VCS\nmethodology VM0015) used for the ex-ante assessment as required in the methodology.\nQuality assurance and quality check procedures regarding the forest cover and forest cover loss are\ndeveloped by the national government through Geobosques according to the \u2018Protocolo de clasificaci\u00f3n de\np\u00e9rdida de cobertura en los bosques h\u00famedos amaz\u00f3nicos\u2019 (MINAM & MINAGRI, 2014). On the other hand,\nthe QA\/QC for the calculation of carbon stock changes is managed internally by a forestry and land use\nexpert. The procedure for the calculation of carbon stock changes includes:\n\u2022 cross-checking descriptions of project activity, emission factors and other estimation parameters\nwith information on the source and sink categories, all following methodology and the FREL for the\nReference Region;\n\u2022 confirming that bibliographical data references are properly cited in internal documentation;\n\u2022 checking that units are correctly carried through from the beginning to end of the calculations;\n\u2022 checking that the conversion factors are correct;\n\u2022 checking that temporal and spatial adjustment factors are used correctly;\n\u2022 checking that there is detailed internal documentation to support the estimates and to enable\nreproduction of the emission reduction estimates;\n\u2022 confirming that estimates are reported for all years;\n\u2022 checking that known data gaps that may result in incomplete emissions estimates are documented\nand treated conservatively; and\n\u2022 comparing current estimates to previous ones, if available. If there are significant changes or\ndepartures from expected trends, the estimates should be re-checked, and the differences explained.\n4.3.2 Task 2: revisiting the baseline projections for future fixed baseline period\nCurrently, the Peruvian FREL has estimations up to 2026; therefore, the baseline will be updated once a\nnew estimate is available, according to the government\u2019s review of agents, drivers and underlying causes of\ndeforestation.\nIn order to identify the positive net impacts of the implemented activities on the climate, the following\nindicators are established37:\n1. By 2023, 90% of the deforestation alert records of the Global Forest Watch technology platform were\nverified and reported.\n37 The first monitoring report for both standards, VCS and CCB, is presenter together with this VCS Project Description.\nFor that reason, the presented indicators are\nv3.3 57"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2026: 79198.0, 2025: 76916.0, 2024: 74634.0, 2023: 72355.0, 2022: 70077.0, 2021: 67801.0, 2020: 65527.0, 2019: 63254.0, 2018: 60888.0, 2017: 58491.0, 2016: 56113.0, 2015: 53775.0, 2014: 56423.0, 2013: 8016.0}"}]}

Whereas, below-ground biomass contributes to 17% and dead-wood\ncontribute with 9%. Therefore, they all represent significant emission sources (above 5%).\nActivities in the baseline scenario lead to a very small production of wood products, as described in the\nbox below, and stock from this pool was estimated for baseline and project scenario. Carbon stock of\nwood products is higher in the project case than in the baseline, that is, more timber is harvested and\ntransformed in wood products in the project scenario when compared to the baseline scenario. Therefore,\ncarbon stock from this pool was conservativelly omited (Please refere to \"AMAPA_baseline_VVB_2013\"\nand \"Tabela Estoque TDR4_2013\").\nDespite Amap\u00e1\u2019s forests are rich in commercially valued species, the logging industry is not\ntraditional in the state and this activity represents a small portion of the local economy (VER\u00cdSSIMO et al.,\n1999). Compared to different states, including its neighbor Par\u00e1, Amap\u00e1 represents only 1% of wood\nharvest volume in Legal Amazon, which does not characterize it as a timber zone (IMAZON; SFB, 2010).\nVerissimo et al. (1999) states that Amap\u00e1\u2019s economy is based on non-wood products, forestry, fishing,\nmining and sales. Not different, such as described in Section 2.5 of the PD, agents of deforestation clear\nlands to take possession and develop small scale agriculture and pastures. Therefore, the conversion of\nforest into non-forest lands in the baseline scenario leads to a lower production of wood products when\ncompared to the project scenario, where the forest is managed with the purpose of wood products\nproduction.\nv3.1! 124\n\n[['', '3.5 Distribution of log production native forests in the main Brazilian states (2005).', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, ''], [None, 'States', None, None, 'Number of\\nCompanies', None, None, '', 'Log', '', '', 'Processed', '', 'Jobs (direct and\\nindirect)', None, None, '', 'Gross', '', None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'consumption', None, None, 'production', None, None, None, None, None, 'Revenue', None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, '(Thousand m3)', None, None, '(Thousand m3)', None, None, None, None, None, '(Million R$)', None, None], [None, '', 'Acre', '', '', '24', '', '', '422', '', '', '193', '', '', '4,641', '', '', '181.96', '', None], [None, '', 'Amap\u00e11', '', '', '48', '', '', '94', '', '', '41', '', '', '1,516', '', '', '32.10', '', None], [None, '', 'Amazonas', '', '', '58', '', '', '367', '', '', '142', '', '', '6,525', '', '', '115.19', '', None], [None, '', 'Maranh\u00e3o', '', '', '54', '', '', '254', '', '', '90', '', '', '3,975', '', '', '59.00', '', None], [None, '', 'Mato Grosso', '', '', '592', '', '', '4,004', '', '', '1,795', '', '', '56,932', '', '', '1,598.36', '', None], [None, '', 'Par\u00e1', '', '', '1,067', '', '', '6,599', '', '', '2,550', '', '', '92,423', '', '', '2,177.61', '', None], [None, '', 'Rond\u00f4nia', '', '', '346', '', '', '2,220', '', '', '925', '', '', '34,825', '', '', '713.49', '', None], [None, '', 'Roraima', '', '', '37', '', '', '188', '', '', '70', '', '', '2,865', '', '', '62.66', '', None], [None, '', 'Legal Amazon', '', '', '2,226', '', '', '14,148', '', '', '5,806', '', '', '203,702', '', '', '4,940.39', '', None], [None, 'Source: IMAZON e SFB, 2010.', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, '1 Includes Macap\u00e1, Laranjal do Jari, Santana, Mazag\u00e3o, Porto Grande e Pedra Branca do Amapari', None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]]\n[['Number of'], ['Companies']]\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n(Step 9.2 VM0015) Calculation of ex ante estimation of total net GHG emissions reductions\nEquation 19 was used as suggested by Methodology VM0015 version 1.1 to estimate ex ante net\ndecrease in Project emissions.

Forest plantation for obtaining\npulp and saw wood and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere were established since October\n2020.\nThe project activity is implemented on degraded land, which is expected to continue to degrade in the\nabsence of the project and hence the land cannot be expected to revert to a non-degraded state without\nhuman intervention.\nForests consist of mostly Eucalyptus grandis plantations (to a lesser extent Eucalyptus dunnii) managed\nwith a rotation length of 25 years. The plantations are established on land previously used for cattle\ngrazing. The implementation of the project activity will not cause any displacement of cattle.\nThe main objectives of the project activity are wood production, land restoration and carbon\nsequestration through afforestation. Forest plantation will be completed by year 5 of the project and\n9"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2020: 5900.630137, 2021: 24880.39726, 2022: 23207.19178, 2023: 22450.57044, 2024: 21604.0597, 2025: 20585.20548, 2026: 19463.30137, 2027: 18297.72307, 2028: 13446.87967, 2029: 3665.931507, 2030: -79306.38356, 2031: -296347.6298, 2032: 16006.19144, 2033: 22512.91781, 2034: 25781.09589, 2035: 26457.54076, 2036: 25726.67842, 2037: 20152.06849, 2038: 8772.205479, 2039: 16443.95744, 2040: -13003.88895, 2041: 26923.08219, 2042: 26688.68493, 2043: 25492.69287, 2044: -837.1312224, 2045: -58789.34247, 2046: 24880.39726, 2047: 23192.77315, 2048: 22478.87069, 2049: 21590.17808, 2050: 20585.20548, 2051: 19451.48892, 2052: 18320.64806, 2053: 13397.80822}"}]}

As addressed in the PD, this is due to the manner in\nwhich the Project is operated, such as: no vehicles, manual labor conducted by the small-hold\nfarmers on their own land, restrictions on chemical fertilizers, no clearing of baseline trees and\nminimal disturbance of the ground for planting.\nThe calculation of the project removals are detailed by PA in Appendix 14. As noted in section\n2.2.2, some of the PAs were removed this verification period. The Verification 2 removals were\n128,245.2 tonnes. The loss of instances was 0.0 tonnes. Additional tonnes sequestered during\nthis period were 48,191.5 bringing the total removals for the PD to 176,436.7 tonnes. Subtracting\nthe Verification 2 tonnes gives the 48,191 tonnes in section 4.4.\nProject removals are as calculated in the \"Project Total\" row (bottom of worksheet), \"CO2 in\nStratum (t)\" column, \"Ex-Post Strata\" worksheet of Appendix 14. The total is provided in Section\n4.4, below.\n4.3 Leakage\nFor ex-post leakage, the methodology requires the monitoring of cropland, domesticated grazing\nanimals and domesticated roaming animals displaced by the project activity during the first\ncrediting period. If the indicators were less than 10%, leakage is set to zero. The monitoring\nresults provided in the PD indicated cropland and grazing leakage is below the thresholds that\nrequire further monitoring and that the ex-post leakage can be set at zero.\n4.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\nThe net GhG emissions reductions can be found in column AW, \"PA Summary\" worksheet. It\nreflects the emission reductions calculated from the \"Ex-Post Strata\" worksheet, less the Pending\nand Removed groves.\nThere is no intent to have vintages issued separately in the VCS registry system. The non-\npermanence risk rating is 2.0 and the required buffer is 10%.

the specific project activities in order to achieve the project\u2019s main goals.\n\uf0b7 The Sustainable Forest Management system that has been applied since the start day of the\nproject within the concessions.\n\uf0b7 The maintenance of the FSC Certification through permanent reviews and audits.\n\uf0b7 The commitment with the responsible trade of forest products, being part of the Global Forest\nTrade Network, program managed by WWF.\nEach of the different items mentioned above, through which the project will achieve its expected\nemission reductions, are explained in detail below:\na) REDD Project activities aiming at reducing deforestation\nThe climate project has two main goals:\na) to reduce the pressure for lands with agricultural and cattle ranching purposes by the local\npopulation in the project area and its buffer zone;\nb) to guarantee the sustainable forestry management of both timber concessions through the\nimplementation of an avoided deforestation project that helps to generate higher\neconomical resources for the management of the area.\nThe strategy to achieve these goals is supporting the development of environmentally friendly\nproductive initiatives that will help the families to improve their livelihood conditions.\nThe activities considered to achieve these goals are the following:\nOutcome 1: Contribute to the sustainable development of rural producers living in the buffer\nzone of the project.\n1.1 Socialization and dissemination of the project goals.\n1.2 Identification and selection of proposals for the environmentally friendly productive\nprojects.\nv3.0 45"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2046: 305469.0, 2045: 311941.0, 2044: 322973.0, 2043: 310258.0, 2042: 361427.0, 2041: 339176.0, 2040:

Summary of baseline and project emissions and project removals, and total net\nemissions and removals with all uncertainty calculations.\n5.7 Exceptional Climate Change Adaptation Benefit\nThe rebuilding of soil organic carbon from the project activities of widespread PR grazing\npractices will likely induce dramatic improvements in the ability of people in the project area to\nadapt to climate change. Recent climate trends in the region[55] suggest a reduction in mean\nprecipitation, with longer periods of consecutive years with either above- or below-average\nprecipitation. The principal defense for pastoralist communities against such projected changes is\nto build heterogeneity in grazing use of the landscape so as to create opportunities for \u201cchasing\u201d\nspatially and temporally variable precipitation within a season and the establishment of grass\nbanks as a hedge against drought. The PR grazing practices are fully expected to restore\nperennial grass cover and increase soil organic carbon. The occurrence of greater soil carbon\nacross the project area would result in the following aids in climate adaptation\n1. Increased infiltration and retention of limited precipitation in shallow soil layers [56,57].\nv3.0 57"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2044: 1839869.0, 2043: 1839869.0, 2042: 1839869.0, 2041: 1839869.0, 2040: 1839869.0, 2039: 1839869.0, 2038: 1839869.0, 2037: 1839869.0, 2036: 1839869.0, 2035: 1839869.0, 2034: 1839869.0, 2033: 1839869.0, 2032: 1839869.0, 2031: 1839869.0, 2030: 1839869.0, 2029: 1839869.0, 2028: 1839869.0, 2027: 1839869.0, 2026: 1839869.0, 2025: 1839869.0, 2024: 1839869.0, 2023: 1839869.0, 2022: 1839869.0, 2021: 1839869.0, 2020: 1839869.0, 2019: 1839869.0, 2018: 1756239.0, 2017: 1672608.0, 2016: 1588978.0, 2015: 1505347.0, 2014: 1335781.0, 2013: 69112.0}"}]}

In such a case, the\ncarbon from the harvested trees will have been debited from the total carbon of the PA\nand only the carbon from the new trees will be counted.\nq. Remove-Member Quit. Some members have quit. Reasons include, they refuse to be\nquantified so they are dropped from the program; they say they have not received any\ncarbon payments; they had a misunderstanding with another member; they felt that\nparticipation was not in their best interest; because they did not want to participate;\nbecause they felt the carbon payment was not adequate and some for undisclosed\nreasons. We do not expect members in this category to change their minds.\nr. Remove-Nursery, not a tree grove. This was a nursery mislabeled a grove.\ns. Remove-Overlap. These are cases where subsequent to validation we learned that the\nPA boundary overlapped with another PA boundary. These PAs have been removed to\navoid double counting.\nt. Remove-Registration Error. These are PAs that the farmers says were not part of\nTIST. The likely cause is the Quantifier misunderstood the farmer during baseline and\ntracked the wrong area.\nu. Remove-Trees Removed. These are PAs where trees were removed because the land\nwas needed for cultivation, home construction, powerlines, road expansion or school\nexpansion. The land is not expected be available in the future as a TIST PA.\nv. Remove-Unauthorized Registration. These are cases where an unauthorized person\nregistered the PA for TIST. Sometimes it is the wife joining and the husband later\nrefusing.\nLoss of a few PAs was discussed in the External Risk section of the Non-Permanence Risk\nReport. It was considered possible but of minimal risk to the carbon asset. Since this\nmonitoring report has determined that the total carbon stocks have increased from the\nprevious one, it is clear that the loss has not caused a loss event or reversal.\n5.3 Leakage\nFor ex-post leakage, the methodology requires the monitoring of cropland, domesticated\ngrazing animals and domesticated roaming animals displaced by the project activity during\nthe first crediting period. If the indicators were less than 10%, leakage is set to zero. The\nmonitoring results provided in the PD indicated cropland and grazing leakage is below the\nthresholds that require further monitoring and that the ex-post leakage can be set at zero.\n5.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\n26"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2004: 375.0, 2005: 1938.0, 2006: 5638.0, 2007: 11163.0, 2008: 14877.0, 2009: 16172.0, 2010: 16362.0, 2011: 16235.0, 2012: 16373.0, 2013: 16455.0, 2014: 16427.0, 2015: 16424.0, 2016: 16307.0, 2017: 15591.0, 2018: 15013.0, 2019: 14689.0, 2020: 15469.0, 2021: 16095.0, 2022: 16125.0, 2023: 16125.0, 2024: 16125.0, 2025: 16125.0, 2026: 16125.0, 2027: 16125.0, 2028: 16106.0, 2029: 16008.0, 2030: 15953.0, 2031: 15960.0, 2032: 16003.0, 2033: 16086.0}"}]}

The owners are seeking an alternative\nwhich will provide them with a comparable income, while protecting and improving\nthe native forests of the region. This will support local biodiversity conservation,\nmaintain watersheds and enhance carbon stocks.\nThe project is located in the Northern Midlands of Tasmania, Australia. Tasmania is\nglobally known for its old growth native forest, endemic species, significant\nbiological diversity and spectacular wild places. Tasmania is home to one of the\nworld\u2019s last great temperate wilderness areas, to the world\u2019s tallest hardwood trees\n(often exceeding 100m in height) and to the largest tract of temperate rainforest in\nAustralia. The exceptional ecological values of Tasmania\u2019s natural landscapes have\nbeen internationally recognized, notably by the IUCN (IUCN 19891), the Tasmanian\nDepartment of Parks, Wildlife and Heritage (DPWH 19902), and the Forests and\nForest Industry Council\u2019s Balanced Panel of Experts (FFIC 19903).\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n1 IUCN (1989) World Heritage Nomination\u2014 IUCN Technical Evaluation 507, Tasmanian Wilderness\n(Australia).

Emission reductions:\nB.6.1. Explanation of methodological choices:\nBy replacing electricity generated by fossil fuel fired power plant connected into North China Power Grid,\nthe proposed project will achieve CO emission reduction. In baseline scenario, the electricity would be 2\notherwise generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants or by the addition of new generation\nsources.\nThe spatial extent of the project boundary includes the project site and all power plants connected\nphysically to the electricity system that the CDM project power plant is connected to. The project\nelectricity system of the proposed project is defined as the North China Power Grid, and the connected\nelectricity system is defined as Northeast China Power Grid. There is electricity import from Northeast\nChina Power Grid to North China Power Grid, i.e., 4244.38GWh, 4514.55GWh and 23423GWh in 2003,\n2004, and 2005 respectively (China Electric Power Yearbooks 2004, 2005 and 2006).\nTo determine baseline scenario emissions, firstly ex ante emission factors of Operating Margin (EF )\nOM,y\nand Build Margin (EF ) were calculated based on the history data of the North China Power Grid,\nBM,y\nwhich include the installed capacity, electricity generation and different types of fuel consumptions of all\nthe power plants connected into the North China Power Grid. Secondly, the baseline emission factor\n(EF ) was calculated as a combined margin(CM) of the Operating Margin (OM) and Build Margin (BM)\ny\nemission factors as described in following three steps. All the calculation is in compliance with\nrequirement of the baseline methodology (ACM0002), the details is listed in the following steps.\nStep 1: Calculation the Operating Margin emission factor (EF )\nOM,y\nCalculation of OM emission factor should be based on one of the four following methods:\n(a) Simple OM, or\n(b) Simple adjusted OM, or\n(c) Dispatch Data Analysis OM, or\n(d) Average OM.\nThe justifications of the choice of methodology to calculate OM emission factor are as follows.\nMethod (c): If the dispatch data is available, method (c) should be the first methodological choice. This\nmethod requires the dispatch order of each power plant and the dispatched electricity generation of all the\npower plants in the power grid during every operation hour period. Since the dispatch data, power plants\noperation data are considered as commercial secret materials and only for internal usage not available\npublicly. Thus, method (c) is not applicable for the proposed project.\nMethod (b): Method (b) requires the annual load duration curve of the power grid and the load data of\nevery hour data during the whole year on the basis of the time order. As mentioned above, the dispatch\ndata and detailed load curve data were not available publicly. Therefore, method (b) is not applicable for\nthe proposed project as well.\nMethod (d): Method (d) will only be used when (1) low-cost\/must run resources constitute more than\n50% of total grid generation and detailed data to apply option (b) is not available, and (2) where detailed\ndata to apply option (c) above is unavailable.

The excerpts from the stakeholder consultation process are detailed below (the original stakeholder\nconsultation details pertaining to each project site have been provided to the DOE):\nQ.1: In what way the project activity contributes to emission reductions?\nResponse 1 from LMWL: Generation of electricity using coal and other petroleum products like natural gas would\nemit carbon dioxide but generation of electricity by using wind mills is a clean process which does not involve\nburning of fuels and therefore generation of CO does not occur. This way the wind mills contribute to CO 2 2\nemission reductions.\nQ.2: The project activity should increase job opportunities to local population:\nResponse 2 from LMWL: LMWL is employing local people for the operation, maintenance and for security\npurposes in their wind farms and are also engaging workmen for cleaning of bushes, fencing work and other day to\nday activities\nQ.3: The project proponent should give a fixed annual income to the gram Panchayat based on number of\nturbines:\nResponse 3 from LMWL: Every year, LMWL pays 1200 INR\/ Wind mill as tax to the gram Panchayat and is also\npaying land tax and building tax every year thus ensuring fixed annual income to the Panchayats based on the\nnumber of wind turbines.\nQ.4. Request to LMWL to improve the basic amenities in their gram Panchayats:\nResponse 4 by LMWL: LMWL representatives assured that the contribution for the improvement of basic\namenities will be made as and when there is a request from the local Panchayats\nQ.5 Request to allow villagers to cultivate in the open space in the wind farms:\n34"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2016: 59205.0, 2015: 59205.0, 2014: 59205.0, 2013: 59205.0, 2012: 59205.0, 2011: 59205.0, 2010: 59205.0, 2009: 57617.0, 2008: 50723.0, 2007: 38016.0}"}]}

Brief explanation of how the anthropogenic emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gas\n(GHGs) by sources are to be reduced by the proposed small-scale project activity, including why\nthe emission reductions would not occur in the absence of the proposed small-scale project activity,\ntaking into account national and\/or sectoral policies and circumstances:\nThe prime objective of the project activity is to generate clean power with zero emissions harnessing the\nwind potential of the site. The power generated by the project activity is being supplied to the Karnataka\nElectricity Board Grid in the absence of which the same power will be fed into the grid through fossil fuel\nbased generation. Hence, the resultant wind power (supplied to the grid) will displace fossil fuels used for\npower generation and hence avoid the GHG emissions, mainly CO associated with fossil fuel based 2\npower.\nThe power plant uses environmentally sustainable available wind source to generate power which does\nnot produce GHG emission. Moreover, this project activity is the only one in the area to be connected to\nthe distribution grid at the H. D. Pura substation which has also contributed to the improvement in the\nelectricity facilities in the nearby areas thus enhancing the quality of life for the local people in the\nvicinity.\nA.4.3.1 Estimated amount of emission reductions over the chosen crediting period:\nThe crediting period of the project activity will start from the date of the registration of the project\nactivity during 2007.\n\n[['2011 \u2013 2012', '14,167'], ['2012 \u2013 2013', '14,167'], ['2013 \u2013 2014', '14,167'], ['2014 \u2013 2015', '14,167'], ['2015 \u2013 2016', '14,167'], ['2016 \u2013 2017', '14,167'], ['Total Estimated Emission Reductions\\n(Tonnes of CO e)\\n2', '1,31,045'], ['Total number of crediting years', '10'], ['Annual Average over the crediting\\nperiod of estimated reductions\\n(Tonnes of CO e)\\n2', '1,31,04.5']]\nCDM-SSC-PDD (version 02)\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board page 9\n2\nA.4.4.

The Project Proponent\nused this tool to assess all relevant risks to the Chyulu Hills REDD+ Project from natural, economic and\nmanagement sources. It was determined that the overall risk level is moderate. Many risks can be\nminimized through the efficacy of Project Activities, community outreach, involvement in Project design\nand operation and experienced management. The Project Proponent has significant experience in the\ndesign and operation of REDD+ projects and Jurisdictional REDD+ approaches. These experiences will\ndrawn upon to mitigate potential risks to the Chyulu Hills REDD+ Project throughout the Project lifetime.\nNon-permanence risk assessment for the Chyulu Hills REDD+ Project was performed using the VCS\nNon-Permanence Risk Tool v3.2 and Risk Report Calculation Tool v3.0. Please refer to Annex 12 \u2013 \u2018Non-\nPermanence Risk Tool\u2019.\n5.6.4 Quantifying Net Emission Reductions Across PAAs\nThere are two PAAs in the Chyulu Hills REDD+ Project, a Forest Project Accounting Area and a\nGrassland Project Accounting Area. NERs are calculated separately for each PAA, and subsequently\naggregated to arrive at total NERs for the Project, for each monitoring period.\n5.6.5 Ex-Ante Estimation of NERs\nEx-Ante NERs are calculated for both the Grassland Project Accounting Area and the Forest Project\nAccounting Area according to the guidance and process detailed in various sections above. Please refer\nto Annex 10 \u2013 \u2018NER Worksheet-Forest PAA\u2019 and Annex 11 \u2013 \u2018NER Worksheet-Grassland PAA\u2019 for\ndetailed NER calculations. The Ex-Ante NERs presented here are based on an initial ecosystem\ninventory performed on the two PAAs. All parameter values have been identified at the time of validation.\nEx-ante estimates for NERs are assumed to be conservative, as they fail to consider additional emission\nreductions due to forest (or grassland) growth within the Project Accounting Areas or further degradation\nwithin the proxy area(s).\nIn the case when ex-ante estimates are used to prove the significance of emissions sources or\nestimate the quantity of NERs over the project crediting period, the project description must\ninclude the following:\nPDR. 118 The projected avoided baseline emissions, project emissions and leakage for each\nmonitoring period and vintage year over the lifetime of the project.\nv3.0 136"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2043: 1111482.0, 2042: 753599.0, 2041: 778692.0, 2040: 810277.0, 2039: 840433.0, 2038: 1217146.0, 2037: 890728.0, 2036: 937763.0, 2035: 960814.0, 2034: 990403.0, 2033: 1355646.0, 2032: 1067120.0, 2031: 1109874.0, 2030: 1140664.0, 2029: 1176751.0, 2028: 1495892.0, 2027: 1251427.0, 2026: 1271327.0, 2025: 1281604.0, 2024: 1287787.0, 2023: 1464819.0, 2022: 1258641.0, 2021: 1226872.0, 2020: 1191836.0, 2019: 1132144.0, 2018: 1153454.0, 2017: 995038.0, 2016: 916396.0, 2015: 831172.0, 2014: 1128485.0}"}]}

Technology to be employed by the project activity:\nGiven that the wind speed at 65m is around 6.81m\/s and the wind disturbance intensity is 0.147, which is\nsuitable for wind turbines of IECIII class, the 850 kW Gamesa58 wind turbine made by Gamesa\nCorporation was finally adopted. Considering various technical and economic factors including\ngeneration, investment and installation, 65m was selected as installation height of the wind turbine for the\nproposed project.\nThe Gamesa Eolica\u2019s G58-850kW is a three bladed, upwind, pitch regulated and active yaw wind turbine.\nIt has a rotor of 58m and uses the Ingecon-W control system concept that enables the wind turbine to\noperate in a broad range of variation of rotor speed and maximizes the power output by choosing the\ncombination of rotor speed and pitch angle.\nAdditional technical details are:\n\u25cf Certified class: Class IIIB\n\u25cf Rotor diameter 58m,\n\u25cf Capacity 0.85 MW,\n\u25cf Cut-in wind speed 3m\/s,\n\u25cf Cut-out wind speed 21 m\/s\n\u25cf Extreme reference wind speed 52.5m\/s\n\u25cf Life time 20 yeaers,\nEach turbine will have a 690V-to-35kV transformer, from which a 35kV line will link into the on-site\n35kV-to-66kV transformer which will be constructed for the proposed project. The proposed project will\nconnect with the 220kV Wenhua substation through the 66kV line, where the power generation of the\nwind farm can be easily transmitted to the NEPG grid, replace partial power generated from fossil fuels\nand reduce GHG emissions.\nA.4.4.

The project is classified as a mega project, as the\nestimated gross emissions reductions over the 30 year crediting period are 48,448,769 m.t. GHG or\non average, 1,614,959 m.t. GHG per year. When accounting for a conservative risk-of-reversal buffer\ndiscount from the annual emissions reduction, Wildlife Works aims to reduce 38,759,015 m.t. GHG or\non average, 1,291,967 metric tonnes per year. Additional tonnes may be deducted for leakage.\n1.4 A brief description of the project:\nThrough a combination of dryland forest protection and extraordinary community sustainable\ndevelopment activities, this project is estimated to avoid the gross emissions of over 48 million metric\ntonnes of CO2e which would have been emitted due to slash and burn deforestation over the 30 year\nproject life, or on average approximately 1,614,959 m.t. per year across the carbon pools of above\nand belowground forest biomass (forest carbon), and soil carbon.\nThe Project Area is home to a fantastic diversity of mammals (over 50 species of large mammal,\nmore than 20 species of bats), birds (over 300 species) and important populations of IUCN Red List\nspecies such as Grevy\u2019s zebra (Equus grevyi), Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), Lion (Panthera leo) as\nwell as over 500 African elephants (Loxidonta africana) seasonally.\nThe project is shown to be clearly additional (under the project financial additionality tool) and the\nbaseline, far hypothetical, is an intelligent extrapolation of empirically measured deforestation that\nwas occurring aggressively in the reference region immediately adjacent to the project area at the\ntime Wildlife Works arrived in the area. This has been demonstrated clearly from historic satellite\nimagery analysis and the fitting of a logistical Cumulative Deforestation Model (CDM) which accounts\nfor resource constraints typical in mosaic deforestation locales.\nWildlife Works also plans to implement, and has in fact has begun many leakage mitigation activities,\nincluding an organic greenhouse, reforestation projects, an EcoCharcoal alternative to \"bush\"\ncharcoal, an organic clothing factory and many other forms of alternative livelihoods.\n1.5 Project location including geographic and physical\ninformation allowing the unique identification and delineation\nof the specific extent of the project:\n3"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2017: 94291.0, 2016: 94291.0, 2015: 1632397.0, 2014: 1629346.0, 2013: 1620128.0, 2012: 1592267.0, 2011: 1508066.0, 2010: 1253588.0}"}]}

The project considers\nthe construction of: a water intake in the Lican River with 8 m3\/s design flow, a pressure penstock with\n238.2 meter head, a daily peak hour reservoir of 102,000 m3 volume and 30,870 m2 area, a power house\nwith two sets of horizontal axis Francis turbines of 8.603 MW each connected to their correspondent\npower generators of 9.090 MW each, a 13.2 to 66 KV power transformer of 18 MVA capacity and 28.45\nkm of a single circuit 66 kV transmission line, which connects the project to the SIC grid through the\nexisting Antillanca substation (formerly Rucatayo substation project). The transmission line voltage may\nbe extended to 110 KV in the future, in order to increase the transmission capacity to allow third party\nprojects interconnection to the SIC grid. Nevertheless, this will not affect the Project installed capacity,\nequipment, annual generation nor its layout.\nAverage annual energy production of the Project is estimated in 92.101 GWh, obtained through a 48\nhydrologic statistical average from years 1959 to 2006, resulting in 57.83% plant factor.\nThe net electricity delivered to the grid will be monitored continuously on by electric meters on site.\nThe Project will help to stimulate the development of Non Conventional Renewable Energy (ERNC)\nindustry in Chile and will contribute to transfer technology and know-how to the country on small\nrenewable zero-emissions developments.\nv3.0 5"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2020: 221461.0, 2019: 221461.0, 2018: 221461.0, 2017: 221461.0, 2016: 221461.0, 2015: 221461.0, 2014: 221461.0, 2013: 221461.0, 2012: 221461.0, 2011: 423845.0, 2010: 334483.0}"}]}

Indicate the lifetime of the project activity(s).\nThe proposed project activity involves the conversion of degraded and degrading lands in to commercial\nbamboo plantations of native timber bamboo, Guadua aculeata.\nGuadua aculeata is native to Nicaragua, and can be found growing naturally within the tropical Atlantic region\nof the country. Guadua bamboo exhibits gregarious and mass flowering, every 60-100 years, and Guadua\naculeata had its most recent flowering 2007-2011. EcoPlanet Bamboo has combined agronomical, forestry,\ncarbon and business and finance expertise in a unique team to realize this project within an area that has\ntraditionally been subject to severe poverty and low opportunities for economic development, combined with a\ntrend of increasing deforestation and continued land degradation.\nAs a raw material bamboo has little to no value. Over the past few years new technologies have become\navailable for the processing of raw bamboo into value added products, in markets where it can take an\nincreasing share of traditional timber products. However, these technologies are still under development, and\nthe market is new and uncertain. As such, there is considerable risk associated with the development of such\ncommercial projects, exacerbated by the rural nature of the project location, and the perceived risk of\nNicaragua for foreign investment.\nEcoPlanet Bamboo has issued innovative new finance mechanisms, in the form of an asset backed bamboo\nbond, to finance the development of these plantations. As such, the company has undertaken considerable\ndebt, and intends to utilize carbon finance to meet these debt repayments and ensure the sustainability of the\nproject.\nIf successful, the proposed project activities will not only sequester and store considerable volumes of\natmospheric CO but additionally reduce pressure on natural forests, and impact positive social change within 2\nthe surrounding areas.\nProject activities include the following:\n\uf0b7 Development of nurseries to supply the necessary seedlings for the reforestation activity\n\uf0b7 Training of skilled and unskilled teams for all aspects of nursery and plantation management\n\uf0b7 Land preparation (including staking and digging of holes) all carried out manually\n\uf0b7 Planting of seedlings and subsequently 5+ years of plantation care and management\n\uf0b7 GIS and mapping of current ecosystems, ex ante and ex post strata\nv3.0 8"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2011: 81973.69399, 2012: 104705.106, 2013: 125118.5589, 2014: 65142.6411}"}]}

If after baseline re-evaluation, a new cumulative deforestation model\nfalls below the old model, this would not constitute a reversal. Rather if credits were generated\nfrom avoided deforestation prior to baseline re-evaluation at a level greater than predicted by the\nnew baseline model after baseline re-evaluation, then the project proponent will not generate any\nnew credits from avoided deforestation until the new cumulative deforestation model reaches the\nprevious level of predicted deforestation that generated these credits.\nAt the end of the project crediting period, the project proponent must estimate the final level of\ncumulative deforestation using the most current baseline model and use this estimate to quantify\nthe total number of cumulative credits per eq. [34] (see above). If this estimate is greater than the\nv3.1 75\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nnumber of credits issued during the project crediting period, then this difference will be subtracted\nfrom the buffer pool.\nv3.1 76\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n4 MONITORING\n4.1 Data and Parameters Available at Validation\nA list of parameters available at validation is provided in Annex 3, provided separately.\n4.2 Data and Parameters Monitored\n4.2A ll variables and parameters referred to in Annex B of VM0009 that are not available at validation are\nmonitored as required by the methodology.\n4.2\n4.2\n4.3 D escription of the Monitoring Plan\n4.2\n4.3.1 O verview\n4.2\nThe procedures described in this section refer to the data needed to calculate the total carbon\n4.2 stock in selected pools within the project area and their uncertainty. These procedures are used\nboth for establishing the initial carbon stock within the project area and the carbon stock at each\n4.2 monitoring event. The project employs permanent sample plots (PSP) coupled with allometric\nequations for estimating carbon stocks in trees. Non-tree biomass and standing dead wood are\n4.2 also measured in the PSP, while carbon pools of lying dead wood is conservatively omitted. Soil\ncarbon is estimated using soil samples collected. These sampling procedures are designed to\n4.2 detect both increases in carbon stocks, such as those that occur as a result of forest growth, and\ndecreases in carbon stocks, such as changes that may take place as a result of degradation or\n4.2 natural disturbance events.\n4.2 Carbon stocks are estimated for the first monitoring period by sampling all plots in all strata. After\nthe first monitoring period, all plots and all strata will be re-measured at least every five years.

In the 1st version of FSR, the equity IRR without CDM is 5.6% which is lower than benchmark\n(8%). Furthermore since the lack of 2MW\/unit wind power turbine supply from the domestic market in\nChina, the project owner change the original plan of the proposed project instead of installation 33 wind\nturbines, with the per unit capacity of 1.5 MW which produced by Gold Wind Company. At 22\/09\/2006, the\nproject owner informed the manufacturer the result of bidding for major equipment.34 It is obviously, the\nchange of major equipment would lead to the influence on IRR of project, and effect the financial attractive\nof proposed project.\nIn order to noticed the detail financial information of proposed project, after the choice period of equipment,\nthe project owner hold a meeting (08\/10\/2006) formally state the decision on starting of project with\nessentiality of CDM, and ask the Research Institute to revise the FSR considering the related changes with\nnew type of major equipment, and apply for the approval of local government again. Other side, according to\nthe result of bidding, the equipment purchase contract has been signed at 11\/2006 before the FSR completed.\nThe 2nd version of FSR is finished at 27\/06\/2007 since the Research Institute spend a lot of time to revise it,\nduring this period, the project owner should start to facilitate the engineering of project at 01\/01\/2007,\nhowever, the project owner considered the FSR revision before the decision to start with the project and the\nequipment purchase contract at the internal meeting.\nThat is why the equipment contract was signed and the construction was started before the 2nd version is\nfinished. In a conclusion, the project owner made the final decision based on the new situation which is\nindicated by 2nd FSR.\nA.4.4 Estimated amount of emission reductions over the chosen crediting period:\nDuring the 7 years of the first crediting period, the total CO emission reductions to be accrued by the 2\nproposed project activity are estimated as 705,040tCO 2e, as shown in Table 1.\nTable 1.

The crediting period will be\nrenewed twice to a total of 90 years.\n1.7 Project Scale and Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals\nThe implementation of the project will bring about an estimated 10,119,729 tonnes of CO 2\nequivalent in emission reductions (tCO e) over the first 10 year fixed baseline period. This 2\nequates to an average 1,011,973 tCO e emissions reductions per year and the project is a 2\nLarge project (>300,000 tCO \/year). 2e\nThe estimated average annual GHG emissions reductions generated by CAZ (after\naccounting for leakage and prior to buffer withholding) are presented below in Table 1. Since\nthe first baseline period is ten years, GHG benefits are shown until 2017.\nTable 1.

CAZ is equivalent to an IUCN category VI protected area1 -\nan area managed mainly for the sustainable use of natural resources (a R\u00e9serve de\nRessources Naturelles in Madagascar\u2019s national legislation). The creation, management and\nzoning of the protected area are presented here. The fundamental hypothesis for this project\nis that local forest-stakeholders must gain a net benefit from the implementation of the\nprotected area if it is to stop deforestation. To achieve this, the project is using the protected\narea as a framework to provide local people with improved rights over the use of the forest\nresources in community use areas, viable alternative livelihoods to deforestation, and will use\ncarbon revenues to pay local people to work on the conservation of the area. These\ncombined activities are intended to encourage more productive land uses over the medium\nand long term.\nThe principal cause of deforestation is Tavy (slash-and-burn cultivation): the combination of a\nco-managed, multiple-use protected area with the suite of development actions will reduce\nTavy and effectively address the key cause of deforestation.\nProtected area creation\nTo ensure ownership of the conservation process, a participatory approach was adopted for\nthe creation of the CAZ protected area. Stakeholders such as ministerial representatives, civil\nsociety groups, local authorities, and community-based organizations participated in the\nsequence of steps that led to the establishment of the protected area.\nInitial Scientific and Technical Planning Workshop\nIn February 2005 a first planning workshop with biologists, foresters, and sociologists who\nhad conducted research in CAZ was held to ensure that the scientific basis for establishing\nCAZ as a protected area was solid. This workshop resulted in an initial proposal for the CAZ\nboundaries that was largely based on biodiversity value. This initial proposed boundary\nremains very similar to the final protected area limit that has been agreed upon following the\npublic consultation process.\n1 IUCN definition: \u201cCategory VI protected areas conserve ecosystems and habitats, together with\nassociated cultural values and traditional natural resource management systems. They are generally\nlarge, with most of the area in a natural condition, where a proportion is under sustainable natural\nresource management and where low-level non-industrial use of natural resources compatible with\nnature conservation is seen as one of the main aims of the area.\nv3.1\n10"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2017: 1730772.0, 2016: 1523275.0, 2015: 1493267.0, 2014: 1328143.0, 2013: 693005.0, 2012: 596188.0, 2011: 422868.0, 2010: 239465.0, 2009: 111993.0}"}]}

The main biodiversity objective of the Project is the preservation of biodiversity, particularly\nmedium-to-large mammals in the project areas. To ensure these climate, community and biodiversity\nbenefits of the Project are maintained and enhanced beyond the project lifetime, the Chaco Forest,\nparticularly the Chaco Forest within the initial project instance, needs to remain as forest. To accomplish\nthis overarching objective, the following measures are needed and designed:\n\u25cf The continuing involvement and support of Quadriz, the landowner(s), universities, the\nParaguayan Government, and local communities are needed to ensure ongoing management\nand monitoring of the project takes place. To this end, Quadriz has hired expert local staff,\nhas training plans in place to ensure staff continuity, and ongoing stakeholder engagement\nplans to help ensure ongoing support;\n\u25cf Ongoing funding is needed to help finance some of the activities beyond the project lifetime,\nsuch as Chaco Med, monitoring community benefits, and monitoring medium-to-large\nmammals using wildlife cameras.

As demonstrated in Section 4.2 of the PD, the change\nin baseline carbons stocks is below the threshold that would require monitoring. Because only\nthe trees planted as part of the project are counted in the estimation of project removals, the\nbaseline carbon stocks are fixed at zero.\n4.2 Project Emissions\nProject emissions are considered zero. As addressed in the PD, this is due to the manner in\nwhich the Project is operated, such as: no vehicles, manual labor conducted by the small-hold\nfarmers on their own land, restrictions on chemical fertilizers, no clearing of baseline trees and\nminimal disturbance of the ground for planting.\nThe calculation of the project removals are detailed by PA in Appendix 14. As noted in section\n2.2.2, some of the PAs were removed this verification period. The Verification 2 removals were\n572,014.6 tonnes. The loss of instances was 129,348.9 tonnes. Additional tonnes sequestered\nduring this period were 252,762.8 bringing the total removals for the PD to 695,428.5 tonnes.\nSubtracting the Verification 2 tonnes gives the 123,414 tonnes in section 4.4.\nProject removals are as calculated in the \"Project Total\" row (bottom of worksheet), \"CO2 in\nStratum (t)\" column, \"Ex-Post Strata\" worksheet of Appendix 14. The total is provided in Section\n4.4, below.\n4.3 Leakage\nFor ex-post leakage, the methodology requires the monitoring of cropland, domesticated grazing\nanimals and domesticated roaming animals displaced by the project activity during the first\ncrediting period. If the indicators were less than 10%, leakage is set to zero. The monitoring\nresults provided in the PD indicated cropland and grazing leakage is below the thresholds that\nrequire further monitoring and that the ex-post leakage can be set at zero.\n4.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\nThe net GhG emissions reductions can be found in column AX, \"PA Summary\" worksheet. It\nreflects the emission reductions calculated from the \"Ex-Post Strata\" worksheet, less the Pending\nand Removed groves.\nThere is no intent to have vintages issued separately in the VCS registry system. The non-\npermanence risk rating is 2 and the required buffer is 10%. The non-permanence risk report is\nAppendix 12.\nv3.4 22"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2032: 26636.0, 2031: 26228.0, 2030: 24523.0, 2029: 24393.0, 2028: 24393.0, 2027: 24370.0, 2026: 24364.0, 2025: 24355.0, 2024: 24105.0, 2023: 24095.0, 2022: 23979.0, 2021: 23834.0, 2020: 23744.0, 2019: 23743.0, 2018: 23467.0, 2017: 23049.0, 2016: 22846.0, 2015: 21769.0, 2014: 21206.0, 2013: 20192.0, 2012: 19629.0, 2011: 19104.0, 2010: 17840.0, 2009: 16886.0, 2008: 13860.0, 2007: 9946.0, 2006: 5061.0, 2005: 1947.0, 2004: 640.0, 2003: 44.0}"}]}

The selected BEF is 3.4 and is based on IPCC default for large trees in broadleaf tropical forests (see\nTable 3A.1.10 of IPCC GPG 2006). Finally, the resultant estimate of harvested wood is converted to long-lived\nwood products per equation 102 of the methodology assuming that all harvested wood products are sawnwood.\nThe selected wood waste fraction is 0.24, oxidization factor is 0.850 and short-lived fraction is 0.2. Assuming that\nall harvested wood products are sawnwood is conservative because sawnwood provides that greatest estimates of\nlong-lived wood products of any wood product category and likely not all wood products from the project area are\nsawnwood.\nThe average carbons stored in long-lived wood products is approximately estimated as 23,627 tCO2e per year.\nThese calculations are presented in Annex N.\n5.6.3 TEST THE SIGNIFICANCE OF GHG EMISSIONS\nNo emissions sources are being claimed as de-minimis and therefore significance cannot be tested.\n5.6.4 QUANTIFYING NET EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS\nNet Emissions Reductions (NERs) are quantified in Annex N and are shown in Table 59 below.

This deviation results in conservative\naccounting of leakage outside the leakage belt because the area weighted average value is less than the\naverage value.\nParameter U will be monitored at least once every 10 years, on re-measurement of forest carbon P,SS,i,pool#\nstocks. While module X-UNC requires that monitoring of this parameter occur every < 5 years, this\nrequirement is inconsistent with the VM0007 pools modules, which specify that stock estimates (from which\nuncertainty is calculated) are assumed valid for 10 years. Therefore, a deviation to module X-UNC is applied\nto permit parameter U to be monitored every < 10 years, putting it into alignment with modules CP- P,SS,i,pool#\nAB and CP-D.\n3.2 Quantification of GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\n3.2.1 Baseline Emissions\nDevelopment of the project baseline emissions from unplanned deforestation, both rate and location, was\nconducted in conformance with the VCS modular REDD methodology VM0007, specifically the BL-UP\nmodule using the simple historic approach. The project meets the applicability conditions of this module as\nset out in Section 3.1.2.\nDefinition of Boundaries\nProject boundaries for the development of the baseline include spatial and temporal boundaries from which\ninformation on the historical rate of deforestation is extracted and projected into the future. The rate of\ndeforestation is derived from the reference region for rate, while the reference region for location is used in\nthe spatial modelling component of the baseline. Finally, the leakage belt is the area surrounding the project\narea, where activity shifting leakage (i.e., deforestation which is displaced from the project area due to\nimplementation of the project activities) is most likely to occur.\nSpatial Boundaries\nReference Region for Projecting Deforestation Rate\nThe reference region for rate of deforestation (RRD) has a total area of 5,011,230 ha hectares41 and is\ndelineated as shown in Figure 3.1. It excludes the project area and leakage belt, and all non-forested areas\nat the start of the historical reference period in the year 2005. Further, the reference region has been defined\nwith knowledge of the drivers of unplanned deforestation in the region.\nA guiding principle in the delineation of the reference region was, to the extent possible within the\nrequirements of the VM0007 methodology, to reflect political boundaries (districts), to facilitate any eventual\nalignment with an anticipated Government of Tanzania jurisdictional REDD framework.\nThe main agents of deforestation in the RRD are small scale farmers who intend on establishing croplands\nthrough conversion of forest land. The proportion of agriculturalist to ranchers is the same in the RRD as is\nexpected in the project area in the baseline case42. Landscape factors (i.e., soil type, vegetation type,\nelevation, and slope) do not drive agricultural decisions for small scale farmers (see Table 3.7).\nMaps of the landscape factors, including forest type, soil type, slope, and elevation that were used to help\ndefine the reference region and ensure similarity to the project area can be found in the project database.\nIncorporation of these landscape factors had little effect on delineating the RRD as almost all land in the\nRRD is suitable for conversion to agricultural land.\nLand tenure was also used to help delineate the RRD. Specifically, national parks, forest reserves, and\ngame reserve were excluded from the RRD as these areas differ from the privately-owned project area.\nComparison of the area covered by landscape factors, transportation networks and human infrastructure\nare detailed in the Table 3.7 below.\n41 The area of the RRD is larger than the minimum required (MREF). The MREF was calculated to be\n240,023 ha.\n42 ibid\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 52"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2026: 240140.0, 2025: 249020.0, 2024: 207148.0, 2023: 170188.0, 2022: 162793.0, 2021: 118927.0, 2020: 115964.0, 2019: 70147.0, 2018: 26443.0, 2017: 3343.0}"}]}

This tool evaluates\nthe displacement of crop cultivation and grazing activities. Section 6 of this tool indicates that\nleakage emissions can be considered insignificant if they meet the following requirements:\n1. Leakage emission attributable to the displacement of agricultural activities due to\nimplementation of an A\/R CDM project activity is estimated as the decrease in carbon stocks\nin the affected carbon pools of the land receiving the displaced activity.\n2. Leakage emission attributable to the displacement of grazing activities under the following\nconditions is considered insignificant and hence accounted as zero:\n(a) Animals are displaced to existing grazing land and the total number of animals in the\nreceiving grazing land (displaced and existing) does not exceed the carrying capacity of the\ngrazing land;\n(b) Animals are displaced to existing non-grazing grassland and the total number of animals\ndisplaced does not exceed the carrying capacity of the receiving grassland;\n(c) Animals are displaced to cropland that has been abandoned within the last five years;\n(d) Animals are displaced to forested lands, and no clearance of trees, or decrease in crown\ncover of trees and shrubs, occurs due to the displaced animals;\n(e) Animals are displaced to zero-grazing system.\nMost of the project areas are emerged salty mudflats either blank (with no vegetation) or with\nshrubby mangrove vegetation. These sites are legally protected and no agricultural activities\nincluding grazing are allowed within these areas. The protection and management of illegal\ngrazing on mangrove sites is part of the NEWS project activities including the promotion of\nalternative livestock fodder sources outside the project areas. Therefore, leakage in the whole\nproject area can be assumed as zero for the duration of the project.\n3.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\nThe ex-ante net anthropogenic GHG emission reductions and removals are calculated using\nequation 6 of the methodology AR-AM0014:\n\u2206C = \u2206C \u2212\u2206C \u2212LK \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc45\u2212\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc40,\ud835\udc61 ACTUAL,t BSL,t t\nWhere:\n\u2206\ud835\udc36 = Net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks, in year t;

TIST Uganda is a constantly growing program that seeks to\nverify subsections of the program whenever possible. Data for this project was pulled from the database\non February 1st, 2020. The program is claiming a February 15th, 2015 start date for this project to include\nthe maximum allowable amount of activity.\nEvidence of the project\u2019s start date can be found in the ages of the trees included in this project. Trees\nare planted virtually every day in TIST Uganda. The oldest trees in the project were 5 years old at the\ntime data was pulled. As such, the best possible estimation for the project start date is February 1st,\n2015.20\nTIST quantifiers are trained to assess the age and species of trees. The program sets an internal goal to\nquantify trees every 18 months. More frequent quantifications than the required 5-year interval allow TIST\nto accurately measure the age of individual trees. These ages are incorporated into our database when\ntrees are young (and easier to ascertain the age of the tree). Through the individual counting and\nmonitoring of trees, the program is able to establish the minimum and maximum age of trees in individual\ngroves. This monitoring takes place in conjunction with consultation of farmers who can speak to the age\nof their seedlings.\nThe TIST database automatically rolls forward tree ages. As such, a data set run on February 01, 2020\nwill include trees planted 5 years (but no more) previously. Thus, the program can assess a February 01,\n2015 start date of the activities that led to the generation of GHG emission reductions.\n2.1.15 Benefits Assessment and Crediting Period (G1.9)\nFebruary 1st, 2015 \u2013 February 1st, 2075\n2.1.16 Differences in Assessment\/Project Crediting Periods (G1.9)\nAccounting periods will be the same between GHG and CCB impacts.\n2.1.17 Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals\n20 Appendix 01, Strata, columns J and L\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3\n23\n\n[['2020', '95,391'], ['2021', '95,147'], ['2022', '95,201'], ['2023', '77,453'], ['2024', '86,458'], ['2025', '89,006'], ['2026', '87,639'], ['2027', '91,275'], ['2028', '91,626'], ['2029', '91,634'], ['2030', '91,636'], ['2031', '91,636'], ['2032', '91,636'], ['2033', '91,636'], ['2034', '91,636'], ['2035', '91,636'], ['2036', '91,636'], ['2037', '91,636'], ['2038', '91,636'], ['2039', '59,699'], ['2040', '78,051'], ['2041', '83,476'], ['2042', '81,490'], ['2043', '88,618'], ['2044', '89,259'], ['2045', '89,259'], ['2046', '89,259'], ['2047', '89,259'], ['2048', '89,259'], ['2049', '89,259'], ['2050', '89,259'], ['2051', '89,259'], ['2052', '89,259'], ['2053', '89,259']]\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3\n24\n\n[['2054', '89,259'], ['2055', '89,259'], ['2056', '89,259'], ['2057', '89,259'], ['2058', '89,259'], ['2059', '89,259'], ['2060', '89,259'], ['2061', '89,259'], ['2062', '89,259'], ['2063', '89,259'], ['2064', '89,259'], ['2065', '89,259'], ['2066', '89,259'], ['2067', '89,259'], ['2068', '89,259'], ['2069', '89,259'], ['2070', '89,259'], ['2071', '89,259'], ['2072', '89,259'], ['2073', '89,259'], ['2074', '89,259'], ['2075', '89,259'], ['Total estimated ERs', '5,271,440'], ['Number crediting years', '60'], ['Average annual ERs', '87,857']]\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\n2.1.18 Risks to the Project (G1.10)\nThe long-term sustainability of TIST is dependent upon a carbon market for afforestation\/reforestation\ncredits. The market for VCS credits exists but, by definition, is dependent upon the entities buying credits\nto voluntarily offset their carbon emissions. An expected US market may or may not materialize and, if it\ndoes, may or may not allow AR credits. As of the date of this PD, the carbon markets appear to be\nexperiencing a modest rebound.\nTIST is different than most AR projects, in that it was created for small-scale subsistence farmers.\nBecause of the rules of CDM, many of the farmers in this PD have project areas too small to meet the\nHost Country definition of a forest. Should VCS, or a possible US program, put the same limitation on\nsize, many of the farmers in TIST will no longer be eligible to participate in the carbon market and will lose\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3\n25"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2015: 19746.26301, 2016: 36325.83808, 2017: 57812.33726, 2018: 82811.03562, 2019: 93537.59726, 2020: 95323.36319, 2021: 95145.58749, 2022: 95196.4137, 2023: 78960.36438, 2024: 85713.25464, 2025: 88769.53166, 2026: 87755.10137, 2027: 90966.18904, 2028: 91617.45116, 2029: 91612.05843, 2030: 91635.83014, 2031: 91636.0, 2032: 91657.26444, 2033: 91614.73556, 2034: 91636.0, 2035: 91636.0, 2036: 91657.26444, 2037: 91614.73556, 2038: 91636.0, 2039: 62411.45753, 2040: 76510.44898, 2041: 82997.13458, 2042: 81658.67397, 2043: 88012.60822, 2044: 89225.27175, 2045: 89238.28715, 2046: 89259.0, 2047: 89259.0, 2048: 89279.71285, 2049: 89238.28715, 2050: 89259.0, 2051: 89259.0, 2052: 89279.71285, 2053: 89238.28715, 2054: 89259.0, 2055: 89259.0, 2056: 89279.71285, 2057: 89238.28715, 2058: 89259.0, 2059: 89259.0, 2060: 89279.71285, 2061: 89238.28715, 2062: 89259.0, 2063: 89259.0, 2064: 89279.71285, 2065: 89238.28715, 2066: 89259.0, 2067: 89259.0, 2068: 89279.71285, 2069: 89238.28715, 2070: 89259.0, 2071: 89259.0, 2072: 89279.71285, 2073: 89238.28715, 2074: 89035.8358, 2075: 7804.065574}"}]}

The plantations of\nthe first project instance i.e. the areas which are to be validated in this PD were made within the\nyears 2009-2011 (total 574.34 ha) following the work plan [see the enclosed Work Plan 1 and\nWork Plan 23]. In addition to the first project instance it is foreseen additional 837 hectares to be\nplanted by the year 2020 as presented in the table 1. Plantation establishment and management\nare described also below. The proposed agro-forestry system will assure a proper management\nof trees in cultivated lands allowing the carbon storage by plants biomass and soils, consequently\nproviding a contribution to the greenhouse effect mitigation and the reversal of soil degradation\ntrend. The lifetime of the project activity will be 25 years.

The natural land conditions did\nnot permit arrival and establishment of forest propagules. The project area is a revenue area,\nobtained from the villagers and secluded from the forest lands. The lands under project\nactivity are locally known as Bhata Lands that have poor water holding capacity; no\nvegetation and are heavily prone to wind and water erosion.\nThus, the major purposes of the project activity are to:\n1. Enhance carbon sink through reforestation.\n2. Reclaim the degraded land in a sustainable manner\n3. Reduce pressure on natural forests of the region\n4. Uplift socio-economic status of native rural\nThe total area under the project activity for plantation is 282.35 ha. Gmelina arborea and\nAlbizzia lebbeck are the principal tree species being planted in 248.35 ha of land.

Errors in each pool shall be weighted by the size of the pool so\nthat projects may reasonably target a lower precision level in pools that only form a small\nproportion of the total stock.\nFor both the baseline and the with-project case the total uncertainty is equal to the square root of\nthe sum of the squares of each component uncertainty and is calculated at the time of reporting\nthrough propagating the error in the baseline stocks and the error in the project stocks.\nTherefore, total uncertainty for LtPF project is calculated as:\n(29)\nWhere:\nU total uncertainty for LtPF Project, dimensionless; total|LtPF\nU total uncertainty for the improved forest management activities in the |PRJ\nproject scenario, dimensionless; and\nU total uncertainty for the baseline scenario, dimensionless. |BSL\nv3.3 44"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2042: 60065.0, 2041: 67224.0, 2040: 75518.0, 2039: 76642.0, 2038: 77920.0, 2037: 85319.0, 2036: 95738.0, 2035: 94920.0, 2034: 86860.0, 2033: 100674.0, 2032: 104378.0, 2031: 114706.0, 2030: 114660.0, 2029: 111259.0, 2028: 129795.0, 2027: 122456.0, 2026: 117240.0, 2025: 111977.0, 2024: 137216.0, 2023: 131428.0, 2022: 106721.0, 2021: 183126.0, 2020: 128434.0, 2019: 130235.0, 2018: 108044.0, 2017: 64367.0, 2016: 74812.0, 2015: 62997.0, 2014: 65837.0, 2013: 67813.0}"}]}

The\nproject is located on Binglang River in Tengchong County, Baoshan City, Yunnan\nProvince, P. R. China. It is the second level of total four levels in the hydropower\ndevelopment plan of Binglang River. The surface area is 0.17 km2 and power density\nis 282.4 W\/m2.\nProject Objective\nThe main objective of the proposed project is to generate power from a hydropower\nstation in Yunnan Province and contribute to the sustainability of power generation of\nthe China Southern Power Grid (CSPG). The proposed project is a grid-connected\nrenewable energy project, from which the electricity generated will mostly supply to\nthe Tengchong Power Grid and be connected to the other level of hydropower grid to\nsupport safe operation and transportation of Baoshan Power Grid, an integral part of\nthe CSPG.\nElectricity generated by the proposed project will displace part of the electricity\ngenerated by fuel fired power plants, and thus reduce CO emissions from thermal 2\npower plants. The estimated annual average GHG emission reduction over the first\ncrediting period is 1,786,147 tonnes of CO e. 2\nContribution to sustainable development\nThe construction of the proposed project will bring prominent environmental and\nsocial benefit, and also contribute to region sustainable development through\nfollowing aspects:\n\uf0d8 Reducing the dependence on exhaustible fossil fuels for power generation;\n\uf0d8 Reducing air pollution by replacing coal-fired power plants with clean, renewable\npower;\n\uf0d8 Reducing the adverse health impacts from air pollution;\n\uf0d8 Reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases, to combat global climate change;\n\uf0d8 Raising the quality of the local power supply and contributing to local\ngovernment with more tax revenues;\n\uf0d8 Contributing to local economic development and employment creation;\n\uf0d8 Investing and exploiting natural resource in southwestern inland areas, in\ncompliance with China western development strategies and the Renewable\n3"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2016: 45722.0, 2015: 183893.0, 2014: 183893.0, 2013: 183893.0, 2012: 183893.0, 2011: 183893.0, 2010: 183893.0, 2009: 183893.0, 2008: 163768.0, 2007: 191267.0, 2006: 98139.0}"}]}

It was considered possible but of minimal risk to the carbon asset. Since this monitoring\nreport has determined that the total carbon stocks have increased from the previous one, the loss\nhas not caused a loss event or reversal.\n3.2.3 Leakage\nFor ex-post leakage, the methodology requires the monitoring of cropland, domesticated grazing\nanimals and domesticated roaming animals displaced by the project activity during the first\nmonitoring period. If the indicators were less than 10%, leakage is set to zero. The monitoring\nresults provided in the PD indicated cropland and grazing leakage is below the thresholds that\nrequire further monitoring and that the ex-post leakage can be set at zero.\n3.2.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\nThe equation for calculating the Net GHG Removals is:\nProject removals \u2013 Baseline emissions \u2013 Leakage = Net Removals\n132,727 \u2013 0 \u2013 0 = 132,727\nTable 3.2.4a: Removals by Vintage\nAs part of the VCS requirements, a risk analysis was conducted.41 Based on the tool, the risk\nrating is an exceptionally low 1.0, qualifying this PD for a 10% buffer.\n41 Appendix 12 Risk Analysis\nCCB v2.0, VCS v3.4 41\n\n[['Year', '', 'Net GHG', '', '', 'Buffer', '', '', 'VCUs', ''], [None, None, 'removals', None, None, 'pool', None, None, 'eligible for', None], [None, None, '(tCO2e)', None, None, 'allocation', None, None, 'issuance', None], ['2015', '10,801', None, None, '1,080', None, None, '9,721', None, None], ['2016', '27,838', None, None, '2,784', None, None, '25,055', None, None], ['2017', '27,762', None, None, '2,776', None, None, '24,986', None, None], ['2018', '27,762', None, None, '2,776', None, None, '24,986', None, None], ['2019', '27,762', None, None, '2,776', None, None, '24,986', None, None], ['2020', '10,801', None, None, '1,080', None, None, '9,720', None, None], ['Total', '132,727', None, None, '13,273', None, None, '119,453', None, None]]\nMONITORING REPORT:\nCCB Version 2, VCS Version 3\nTable 3.2.4b: Buffer by Vintage\n3.3 Optional Criterion: Climate Change Adaptation Benefits\n3.3.1 Activities and\/or processes implemented for Adaptation (GL1.3)\nOver the course of the project, several activities have been implemented to assist farmers in\nadapting to climate change. Below are those activities and how they assisted communities to\nadapt to the probable impacts of climate change.\nDrawdown of CO2: Ultimately, climate change must be addressed through the removal of CO2\nfrom the atmosphere. By planting tree, TIST farmers have removed more than 5M tonnes of\nCO2.\nConservation Farming: TIST trains farmers on climate resilient agricultural techniques.\nEducation of FAO Conservation Farming techniques allows farmers to gather minimal rainfall in\nspecially dug and spaced holes. Even in times of drought or limited rainfall, this technique allows\ncrops to grow. More than 121,449 person-training sessions were conducted in Conservation\nFarming during the monitoring period. TIST farmers have report over doubling of yield.\nTrees: Trees retain moisture and create microclimates on TIST participants farms. Trees provide\nshade to cool farms and introduce new organic matter to restore soil health. This makes farms\nmore productive in adverse conditions. Trees prevent erosion and can serve as windbreaks when\nplanted near structures. Landslides are prevalent in Kenya. There are 714,110 trees in this PD.\nCommunity Organization: TIST farmers organize themselves in local and regional groups that\nshare knowledge in monthly Cluster meetings. These meetings provide an opportunity for farmers\nto share experiences and find locally appropriate solutions to local issues. This organization\nmakes TIST farmers better able to navigate the challenges posed by climate change. There are\n304 active Clusters in TIST Kenya that held 14,712 meetings during the monitoring period.\nCCB v2.0, VCS v3.4 42"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2020: 31719.0, 2021: 47578.0, 2022: 47578.0, 2023: 7930.0}"}]}

Some members have quit. Reasons include, they refuse to be\nquantified so they are dropped from the program; they say they have not received any\ncarbon payments; they had a misunderstanding with another member; they felt that\nparticipation was not in their best interest; because they did not want to participate;\nbecause they felt the carbon payment was not adequate and some for undisclosed\nreasons. We do not expect members in this category to change their minds.\nr. Remove-Nursery, not a tree grove. This was a nursery mislabeled a grove.\ns. Remove-Overlap. These are cases where subsequent to validation we learned that the\nPA boundary overlapped with another PA boundary. These PAs have been removed to\navoid double counting.\nt. Remove-Registration Error. These are PAs that the farmers says were not part of\nTIST. The likely cause is the Quantifier misunderstood the farmer during baseline and\ntracked the wrong area.\nu. Remove-Trees Removed. These are PAs where trees were removed because the land\nwas needed for cultivation, home construction, powerlines, road expansion or school\nexpansion. The land is not expected be available in the future as a TIST PA.\nv. Remove-Unauthorized Registration. These are cases where an unauthorized person\nregistered the PA for TIST.

It was considered possible but of minimal risk to the carbon asset. Since this\nmonitoring report has determined that the total carbon stocks have increased from the\nprevious one, it is clear that the loss has not caused a loss event or reversal.\n5.3 Leakage\nFor ex-post leakage, the methodology requires the monitoring of cropland, domesticated\ngrazing animals and domesticated roaming animals displaced by the project activity during\nthe first crediting period. If the indicators were less than 10%, leakage is set to zero.

Prior to the implementation of the project activity no hydropower plant was operational in the\nlocation where Barra Grande HPP is implemented.\nThe baseline scenario is electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have\notherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new\ngeneration sources, as reflected in the combined margin (CM) calculations described in the \u201cTool to\ncalculate the emission factor for an electricity system\u201d.\nThe clean and renewable electricity delivered to Brazilian Interconnected System by Barra\nGrande HPP provides an important contribution to environmental sustainability by reducing carbon\ndioxide emissions that otherwise would have occurred in the absence of the project. The project activity\nreduces emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) by avoiding electricity generation from fossil fuel sources\n(and CO2 emissions), which would be generated (and emitted) in the absence of the project.\nThe emission reduction provided by the project is the difference between the baseline emissions\nand the project emissions, according indicated in version 17.0 of the Large Scale Consolidated\nMethodology ACM0002 \u2013 Grid-Connected Electricity Generation from Renewable Sources (hereafter\ncalled ACM0002 Methodology).\nHPP Barra Grande will use the hydraulic potential of Pelotas River to generate electricity with an\ninstalled capacity of 708 MW and assured energy of 380.6 MWaverage. All equipment and technologies\nemployed in the project have already been successfully applied to similar projects in the country and in\nthe world. The technology applied in the project is well established in the sector. There are three turbines\nwith an installed capacity of 236MW each, totalizing a maximum installed capacity of 708 MW.\nFrancis turbine are used in the project, which is a well-tested turbine in the world for hydro\nelectrical projects. Each generation unit have three meters. One (1) meter for each turbine located at the\nPower House measures total electricity generation. There are two (2) other meters for each generation\nunit located at the substation, responsible for net electricity measurement.\nNational companies were responsible for construction activities. Constru\u00e7\u00f5es e Com\u00e9rcio\nCamargo Correa was responsible for construction and equipment assembly of the plant. Alstom do Brasil\nwas responsible for equipment supply and Engevix Engenharia was responsible for executive and basic\nproject of the plant, as well as for its substation (supplying and equipment assembly).

As demonstrated in Section 4.2 of the PD, the change\nin baseline carbons stocks is below the threshold that would require monitoring. Because only\nthe trees planted as part of the project are counted in the estimation of project removals, the\nbaseline carbon stocks are fixed at zero.\n4.2 Project Emissions\nProject emissions are considered zero. As addressed in the PD, this is due to the manner in\nwhich the Project is operated, such as: no vehicles, manual labor conducted by the small-hold\nfarmers on their own land, restrictions on chemical fertilizers, no clearing of baseline trees and\nminimal disturbance of the ground for planting.\nThe calculation of the project removals are detailed by PA in Appendix 14. As noted in section\n2.2.2, some of the PAs were removed this verification period. The Verification 2 removals were\n22,846.0 tonnes. The loss of instances was 5,755.9 tonnes. Additional tonnes sequestered\nduring this period were 11,598.3 bringing the total removals for the PD to 28,688.4 tonnes.\nSubtracting the Verification 2 tonnes gives the 5,842 tonnes in section 4.4.\nProject removals are as calculated in the \"Project Total\" row (bottom of worksheet), \"CO2 in\nStratum (t)\" column, \"Ex-Post Strata\" worksheet of Appendix 14. The total is provided in Section\n4.4, below.\n4.3 Leakage\nFor ex-post leakage, the methodology requires the monitoring of cropland, domesticated grazing\nanimals and domesticated roaming animals displaced by the project activity during the first\ncrediting period. If the indicators were less than 10%, leakage is set to zero. The monitoring\nresults provided in the PD indicated cropland and grazing leakage is below the thresholds that\nrequire further monitoring and that the ex-post leakage can be set at zero.\n4.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\nThe net GhG emissions reductions can be found in column AW, \"PA Summary\" worksheet. It\nreflects the emission reductions calculated from the \"Ex-Post Strata\" worksheet, less the Pending\nand Removed groves.\nv3.4 21"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2004: 850.0, 2005: 2486.0, 2006: 2628.0, 2007: 3083.0, 2008: 3578.0, 2009: 3774.0, 2010: 3835.0, 2011: 3431.0, 2012: 2648.0, 2013: 3530.0, 2014: 3277.0, 2015: 3230.0, 2016: 2962.0, 2017: 3190.0, 2018: 3464.0, 2019: 3464.0, 2020: 3265.0, 2021: 3449.0, 2022: 3449.0, 2023: 3449.0, 2024: 3449.0, 2025: 3449.0, 2026: 3449.0, 2027: 2669.0, 2028: 1322.0, 2029: 3119.0, 2030: 2648.0, 2031: 2614.0, 2032: 2992.0}"}]}

All\nthe plots in five counties have been barren and do not change after 1970s and before the project. Thus,\nthe change in carbon stock in baseline dead wood biomass and litter biomass can be negligible. For the\npurpose of this project, because the project is on the barren lands suitable for afforestation, forest floor\nonly bushes and scattered raw wood, to protect diversity, at the time of afforestation retained the original\nshrubs and bulk raw wood, based on the principle of cost effectiveness, the baseline scenario\n, is zero.\nTherefore, set the project baseline carbon variation of zero,\u0394C =0.

Therefore the primary purpose of the Project is the highest CO2 absorption during\nthe lifetime of the Project.\nTo achieve this goal, during the 30 years of the Project no cutting of the plants will be carried\nout.\nAs already explained in \u00a7 1.3 the Project is not developed inside a REDD+ program zone\n(Brazil does not have REDD+ programs in Mato Grosso do Sul).\n1.11.1 Planted Areas\nThe Afforestation Project developed in the FNL Project relates to a total area of 342 ha.\nThis area correspond to the Project Area and is divided in 21 planted parcels of different\nextensions. All the planted parcels are listed in the Table 03 below. In this table are present\ninformation about each parcel.\nTable 03: List of the planted parcels.\n13\n\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\nwhere:\n= Emission of non-CO GHGs resulting from burning of biomass and 2\nforest fires within the project boundary in year t; t CO -e 2\n= Emission of non-CO2 GHGs resulting from use of fire in site\npreparation in year t; t CO2-e\n= Emission of non-CO2 GHGs resulting from use of fire to clear the\nland of harvest residue prior to replanting of the land or other\nforest management. in year t; t CO2-e\n= Emission of non-CO2 GHGs resulting from fire, in year t; t CO2-e.\n= 1.2.3. \u2026 years counted from the start of the project activity\nIt can be stated that:\n\u25aa Fire has not been used for the preparation of the Project area and has been used in the\narea at least once during the period of ten years preceding the start of the A\/R VCS Project\nactivity. Thus = 0.\n\u25aa Project lifetime considers activities of harvesting but does not consider the use of fire to\nclear the land of harvest residue or for other forest management. Thus = 0.\n\u25aa Emission of non-CO GHGs resulting from fire are insignificant.
