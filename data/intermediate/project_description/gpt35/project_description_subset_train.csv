2.2 Applicability of Methodology
The methodology AMS-III.R comprises recovery and destruction of methane from manure and
wastes from household agricultural activities that would be decayed anaerobically emitting
methane to the atmosphere in the absence of the project activity. This project is belongs to the (b)
of 1st applicability criteria of AMS III.R because the management practice of a biogenic waste or
raw material was changed from deep pit storage to biogas digesters. The methodology AMS-I.C
comprises renewable energy technologies that supply individual households with thermal energy
that displaces fossil fuels.
The proposed project activity will change the existing swine manure treatment at the household
level from deep pits to household biogas digesters. The biogas digesters provide biogas for
cooking and other heating needs for households, replacing the fossil fuel coal. The project will
reduce CH4 emission from the slurry stored in a deep pit, and reduce CO2 emission from burn of
coal.
Therefore, this project can satisfy the applicable conditions of the methodologies AMS-III.R
(version 03) and AMS-I.C (version 19) as follows in Table B1 and Table B2.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
The project boundary encompasses also the project electricity system(s) and Heat/steam
generation system that the PO plant is connected to. The spatial extent of the project electricity
system consists of the power plants that are physically connected through transmission and
distribution lines to the project activity and that can be dispatched without significant transmission
constraints. The project is connected to the Glow grid which in turn is connected to the national
grid. Therefore, the national grid is considered as the ultimate connected grid. The spatial extent
for the heat (steam) system is similar, including the heat/steam generating systems that are
physically connected to the project activity and that can be displaced without significant
constraints. The heat (steam) requirements of the project are met by the steam extracted from the
cogeneration plants of Glow grid. As the emissions get accounted in the electricity component
therefore to avoid double counting and applying conservative principle the emission factor for
steam has been considered as zero. The fuel requirement is for incineration purpose. Natural gas
is being used as the fuel.

26,methodology,"3.2 Applicability of Methodology
The selected methodology AR-AM0014 Version 03.0 is applicable since the project meets the following
conditions:
Condition 1: The land subject to the project activity is a degraded mangrove habitat.
Applicability: According to the IPCC GPG LULUCF guidelines of 2003, wetlands are defined as land that is
covered or inundated with water for all or part of the year and does not fall under the category of forest
land, agricultural land, grasslands or settlements. The project lands to be planted or restored to
mangroves are inundated in water at high tide and all affected by environmental salinity; therefore, all
areas included fall into the category of wetlands. As the project land has been deforested for the last 10
years, the existing mangroves have deteriorated, and they are no longer able to match the forest
definition.
Condition 2: More than 90 per cent of the project area is planted with mangrove species. If more than
10 percent of the project area is planted with non-mangrove species, then the project activity does not
69

Project Description: VCS Version 4.1
lead to an alteration of hydrology of the project area and hydrology of connected up-gradient and down-
gradient wetland area;
Applicability: All the lands will be planted with different mangroves species. There will be no non-
mangrove species used in this project. The species that will be used are Rhizophora mucronata,
Rhizophora apiculata, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Bruguiera cylindrica and Ceriops tagal.
Condition 3: Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10% of area.
Applicability: There will not be any harmful site preparation techniques such as chemical or aerial site
preparation in this reforestation project activity. Planting is done manually and involves preparing a small
hole for the roots of the seedling, taking into account the complete structure of the soil. Hence
applicability condition 3 will be met.
Condition 4: A project activity applying this methodology shall also comply with the applicability conditions
of the tools:
Applicability conditions of the tool: “Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate
additionality in A/R CDM project activities” (Version 01)
a) Forestation of the land26 within the proposed project boundary, whether performed with or
without being registered as the ARR VCS project activity, shall not lead to violation of any
applicable law, even if the law is not enforced.
Justification - This project is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations’ requirements as
outlined in section 1.14, hence has met with this applicability condition.
b) This tool is not applicable to small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities.
Justification - ""Small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM"" are those
that are expected to result in net anthropogenic greenhouse gas removals by sinks of less than 16
kilo tonnes of CO per year and are developed or implemented by low-income communities and 2
individuals as determined by the host Party (9/CMP.3). This project will generate more than 16 kilo
tonnes of CO per year, so it is not a small-scale afforestation and reforestation project. Hence the 2
project has met with this applicability condition.
Applicability conditions of the tool: “Estimation of non-CO GHG emissions resulting from burning of 2
biomass attributable to an A/R CDM project activity” (Version 04.0)
a) The tool is applicable to all fires that occur within the project boundary.
b) The greenhouse gas emissions other than CO resulting from a fire in the project boundary must 2
be taken into account for any fire affecting an area greater than the minimum threshold area
specified by the host party for the definition of the forest, provided that the accumulated area
affected by such fires in a given year is ≥ 5% of the project area.
Justification – The land belonging to the project is covered by water and experience high and low tide.
These lands are degraded and under the definition of forest. Burning is not carried out due to wet

Demonstrating Land Eligibility as per VCS Standard Version 4.1
According to the AFOLU Requirements, a project must use an internationally recognized definition of a
forest, such as one based on the UNFCCC host-country threshold or the FAO definition. WIF focuses on
the Myanmar national forest definition, as published in the report 'Forest Reference Level of Myanmar'
(2018)27. According to the definition – Forest is a land with tree crown cover of more than 10% and area
larger than 0.5 hectares (ha). Trees must be able to reach a height of at least 5 meters (m) when mature
in situ.

Project Description: VCS Version 4.1
After receiving a land application letter (Letter No. 16022/ A-10) from the government, the Ministry has
assessed the land's condition before granting the land. According to their findings, the lands leased to
the project fall below Myanmar's forest definition and are severely degraded for the last 10 years.
Since the 1980s, mangroves in the Ayeyarwady delta, including the project site, have been exploited and
deforested continuously. These sites are infertile or extremely degraded, according to the Regional
Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation, and no mangrove will grow unless
restored. As a result, it is impossible that these lands will return to their original state if left by itself.
These lands have been degraded to the point where natural regeneration is unlikely. This is in accordance
with the first phase of the tool and further demonstrated that the land is not managed to counteract
degradation. As a result of being underutilized there is no chance of being temporarily unstocked due to
human action.
The applicable requirement for this VCS project was determined on the AFOLU Specific Matters of the
VCS Standard: 'Activities that change natural ecosystems for the purpose of generating GHG credits are
not eligible for the VCS Program.' The project description must provide evidence that no native
ecosystems were removed to create GHG credits in any ARR, ALM, WRC, or ACoGS project locations (e.g.,
evidence indicating that clearing occurred due to natural disasters such as hurricanes or floods). If the
clearance or conversion occurred at least 10 years before the proposed project start date, no proof is
required. As a result, the assessment period was limited to 10 years prior to the project start date in
accordance with VCS regulatory requirements.
WIF used satellite imagery to prove no forest criteria in addition to the letter provided by the Ministry
confirming the no-forest criteria. Landsat imagery was used to assess the status of land use 10 years
before the project's start date. These maps also indicated that no lands met the forest definition 10 years
before to the project's start date, and that the lands had been degraded. Interviews with local residents
revealed that these areas had been deforested for more than ten years prior to the project's
commencement date.
'Activities that drain native ecosystems or degrade hydrological systems to produce GHG credits are not
acceptable under the VCS Program,' explains Section 3.2.5 of the VCS standard (under AFOLU Specific
Matters). The natural hydrological functions of the area (such as tidal change) are unaffected. Mangroves,
on the other hand, develop in an ecosystem that is balanced by tidal cycles, ensuring that no activities
deplete the original habitat. Hence the project is eligible under the VCS program.",2792,2792_vcs_2792_pd_ver04_2r_prr_clean_20231130.pdf,methodology,{'project_methodologies': ['AR-AM0014']},What is the methodology of this project?,{'project_methodologies': ['AR-AM0014']}

Justification:
The project activity is a renewable source of energy (wind power), which supplies electricity to
an electricity distribution system (grid). The proposed project will export 12.72 MUs per annum
of electricity to the respective grid from a renewable source (Wind Energy); this electricity will
be supplied to the Southern and Northern Region Electricity Grid, where the major part of
electricity comes from non-renewable electricity generation.
(cid:2) If the unit added has both renewable and nonrenewable components, the eligibility limit of 15
MW for a small scale CDM project activity applies only to the renewable component. If the unit
added co-fires (non-) renewable biomass and fossil fuel, the capacity of the entire unit shall not
exceed the limit of 15MW
Justification:
This project activity is has only renewable energy component of installed capacity 81 MW (< 15
MW).
So, in light of the above the applicability of this type & category of methodology to this project
is justified
Technology Used:
In wind energy generation, kinetic energy of wind is converted into mechanical energy and
subsequently into electrical energy. Wind has considerable amount of kinetic energy when
blowing at high speeds. This kinetic energy when passes through the blades of the wind turbines,
it is converted into mechanical energy and rotates the wind blades. When the wind blades rotate,
the connected generator also rotates, the rotor and the generator are connected through the gear
box. The mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy in the generator.
E 48 (800kW) WTGs are developed by ENERCON India Limited; it is an indigenous technology
and hence there is no technology transfer to host country. With a rated power of 800 kW and a
sophisticated rotor blade design, the E-48 wind turbine is the most profitable system within its
class. Together with a choice of different tower versions up to 76 m, the E-48 offers an
economically sound solution to complex sites worldwide.

1.1 Project title:
Protection of a Tasmanian Native Forest (Project 1: Redd Forests’ Pilot)
1.2 Type/Category of the project:
Improved Forest Management (IFM), specifically conversion of logged forests to
protected forests (LtPf)
1.3 Estimated amount of emission reductions over the crediting period
including project size:
The project is estimated to produce 4 956 voluntary carbon units a year for the 25 year
duration of the project, while preventing annual emissions of 6 946 tCO2-e. This
means that the project will prevent total emissions of 173 638 tCO2-e over its
lifetime.
1.4 A brief description of the project:
The project is designed to protect 865 hectares of native Tasmanian forest which
would, if not for the project, continue to undergo selective logging.
This project is on the private land of a family who have owned and logged the land
for over one hundred years. The site is therefore under threat of continued selective
logging with natural regeneration, a land management policy implemented recently
across a significant swathe of the property. The owners are seeking an alternative
which will provide them with a comparable income, while protecting and improving
the native forests of the region. This will support local biodiversity conservation,
maintain watersheds and enhance carbon stocks.
The project is located in the Northern Midlands of Tasmania, Australia. Tasmania is
globally known for its old growth native forest, endemic species, significant
biological diversity and spectacular wild places. Tasmania is home to one of the
world’s last great temperate wilderness areas, to the world’s tallest hardwood trees
(often exceeding 100m in height) and to the largest tract of temperate rainforest in
Australia. The exceptional ecological values of Tasmania’s natural landscapes have
been internationally recognized, notably by the IUCN (IUCN 19891), the Tasmanian
Department of Parks, Wildlife and Heritage (DPWH 19902), and the Forests and
Forest Industry Council’s Balanced Panel of Experts (FFIC 19903).

In the area surrounding the Redd Forests pilot project, less than 30% of the original
vegetation remains, much of it in scattered small remnants in poor condition. The past
two decades have seen major changes in this landscape. There are serious and
continuing problems of vegetation loss and degradation, soil erosion, degraded river
systems, dryland salinity, rural tree decline and denuded north-facing slopes. The
catchments are subject to timber harvesting operations and commercial firewood
harvesting is widespread. Forest ecosystems that have been identified as threatened or
old growth forest continue to be cleared.
Currently, less than 2% of the Northern Midlands bioregion is reserved in protected
area networks. This is in stark contrast to the rest of the state, where 37% are national
parks or other forms of public land. A total of 67,093 ha (56,786 ha forest and 10,307
ha non-forest) have been identified as rare, vulnerable or endangered ecosystems or as
ecosystems with a high conservation priority. In this way, severe degradation and loss
of biodiversity will continue unless new initiatives allow for improved land
management practices, including forest conservation. The creation of the Redd
Forests’ pilot project aims to protect native forests from further logging activities and
avoid the resulting GHG emissions in an area under great land-use pressure in the
Northern Midlands, Tasmania.
The Redd Forests Project Area (RFPA) includes 865 ha of native forest, includes
small stands of old growth. The area is dominated by Eucalyptus delegatensis, E.
amygdalina and E. viminalis forest communities, interspersed with E. obliqua, E.
ovata and A. dealbata. Some of the dominant species number among the tallest
hardwood trees in the world. According to the Tasmanian Forests Practices Authority
of Tasmania, 790 ha of this forest is currently available for logging. The historical
baseline involves extensive selective logging and clearfelling with natural
regeneration, a land use that will be continued in the absence of carbon finance.
1.5 Project location including geographic and physical information
allowing the unique identification and delineation of the specific extent
of the project
The project is located within the Australian state of Tasmania (Figure No. 01).
Tasmania is an island located 240 km south of the eastern side of the continent,
separated from the mainland by Bass Strait. The state has a total area of 68 401 square
km, with the main island covering 62 409 square km. Tasmania has an estimated
population of 500,000 (December 2008), with almost half located in or near Hobart.
Tasmania is promoted as the ‘Natural State’ owing to its beautiful and wild
environments. Formally, almost 37% of Tasmania is in reserves, national parks and
World Heritage sites. The island is 364 km long from the northernmost point to the
southernmost point and 306 km from west to east.
The state capital and largest city is Hobart. Other major population centers in
Tasmania include Launceston in the north and Devonport and Burnie in the
northwest. The sub-antarctic Macquarie Island is also under the administration of the
state of Tasmania.

The Cauaxi REDD+ Grouped Project (hereafter called GPD) aims to conserve forests in several private
properties located in northeast portion of Pará, close to the border with Maranhão. The Cauaxi River, which
gives the project its name, is one of the tributaries of the Capim River, located in the central portion of the
project's reference region, at Paragominas municipality.
Located in the north of Brazil, Pará is one of the 27 Brazilian federative units and has an area of almost
1,3 million square kilometers, making it the second largest Brazilian state. GPD is in Pará's southeast
mesoregion in the microregion of Paragominas with a total reference region of 5,268,809 ha and is
approximately 453 km from Belém, the state capital (Figure 1). As GPD is in the “Deforestation Arc”, the
region with historical highest rate of deforestation in the Amazon, its forests are under increased threat from
deforestation.

CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3
It is important to highlight that the actions involving the implementation of the REDD+ Cauaxi grouped
project are complementary to the grouped project for the BRAZILIAN AMAZON APD GROUPED PROJECT
(ID 255111). Through these two projects, in accordance with current federal and state environmental laws,
BRCarbon seeks to promote integral forest conservation actions in rural properties with remaining
vegetation, promote solutions based on nature in its regions of influence, generating co-benefits not only
for the climate (reduction and removal of emissions), but also for communities and local biodiversity.
The GPD aims to create positive economic incentives for landowners to conserve rainforests in private
areas that are vulnerable to degradation and deforestation, while contributing to net positive climate impacts
as well as benefit to traditional communities and conserve biodiversity. According to Brazilian Vegetation
Law (national law 12.651), landowners are required to conserve 80% of the forest cover on properties
located in the Legal Amazon. Since the law is not enforced in the Deforestation Arc, illegal logging and
deforestation in the protected areas inside of the farms are common. One important aspect is that the
conservation and monitoring costs can be prohibitive for the landowner, especially in non-productive and
broad areas. The carbon project can therefore contribute to enforcing the law, providing landowners with
an opportunity to monitor and conserve their lands, as well as engaging local communities in the project
zone.
By joining BRCarbon (hereafter known as BRC) conservation program, forest owners can access
financial funds from the carbon voluntary market to develop conservation and monitoring efforts in their
forests. A partnership between BRC and landowners will result in the legal protection of forests, forest
monitoring using satellite images, biodiversity inventory (including fauna and flora species), and forest
biomass inventory in a broad scale, using an upscaling approach based on field collection, drone-borne
and satellite sensors such as LiDAR (light detection and ranging). In addition, we will involve strength the
surveillance of property, wildfire monitoring, fire prevention and fighting, threatened and monitoring
biodiversity species and social activities with traditional communities in the project zone.
BRC will be responsible for the development, implementation, monitoring, and certification of the
project instances. It is the landowners' responsibility to allow project activities to be implemented in their
areas, as well as the voluntary commitment to their long-term conservation. As a result, BRC expects to
enhance the climate impact of carbon projects, helping communities and biodiversity. This project is related
to climate-positive impacts caused by the reduction of emissions caused by deforestation and avoided
degradation (REDD+). Two voluntary carbon standards are used to certify all projects: the VCS (verified
carbon standard) and the CCB (climate, community, and biodiversity).
This Project Description is related to twenty (20) project activities instances located in the Pará state.
The project activity instances (PAIs) are split in seven municipalities: Dom Eliseu, Rondon do Pará,
Paragominas, Tomé-Açu, Ulianópolis, Goianésia do Pará and Ipixuna do Pará. Since the project starting

Project Description: VCS Version 4.2
Since there exists no delineation of project electricity system or connected electricity systems by
DNA, following criteria has been used to determine the existence of significant transmission
constraints:
• In case of electricity systems with spot markets for electricity: there are differences in
electricity prices (without transmission and distribution costs) of more than 5 percent
between the systems during 60 percent or more of the hours of the year.
• The transmission line is operated at 90% or more of its rated capacity during 90% percent
or more of the hours of the year.
Since the project output is fed to the Turkish electricity grid which does not involve any distinct
electricity systems that applies different price, first criteria defined above is not applicable. Also,
since the transmission line between the proposed projects and nearest substation is built within
the scope of the project and there exist no information on grid capacity utilization, second criteria
is also inapplicable. Based on assessment above, it is difficult to conclude with a significant
transmission constraint or grid boundary. Since there is no dispatch grid system in Turkey, the
project boundary is considered as the National Electricity Grid of Turkey according to applied tool.
The geographical and physical boundaries of the Turkish grid and location of the power plants are
well identified as given diagram below.

63,methodology,"2.2 Applicability of Methodology
 The reforestation Grouped Project meets all the conditions for the applicability of methodology AR-
AMS0007, as follows:
a) The land subject to the project activity does not fall in wetland category;
Rationale: As described in section 1, the Grouped Project will be implemented in Atlantic Forest biome,
which in any type of its five forests: Dense Ombrophilous, Mixed Ombrophilous, Semideciduous Seasonal,
Deciduous Seasonal and Open Ombrophilous (CAMPANILI, M. E. and SCHAFFER, W. B., 2010). However
there is wetland features in Pratigi EPA, this type of ecosystem will not be subject to the project activity, as
described in the IPCC Good Practice Guidance for LULUCF (Soils with restricted drainage leading to periodic
flooding and anaerobic conditions).
b) Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10 per cent of area in each
of the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project boundary:
i. Land containing organic soils;
ii. Land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and receives inputs
listed in appendices 2 and 3 to this methodology.
Rationale: The areas to be reforested under this Grouped Project does not encompass areas with organic
soil, once most of them are characterized as degraded pasture with low percentage of organic matter (less
than 12% of organic carbon in its first 20cm).
The technology to be employed under the Grouped Project is based in three different restoration models,
as presented in section 1.8. Only two of them have the potential to cause some kind of soil disturbance:
models 1 (Total Seedling) and model 3 (SAF). However, none of these two models are supposed to be
implemented in short-term or set aside cropland23 or grassland, but mainly in abandoned degraded pasture.
Thus, neither cropland nor grassland in the baseline is subjected to land-use and management practices
such described in appendices 2 and 3 of the referred methodology. However if some PAI encompasses one
23 Cropland does not make part of the Grouped project boundary

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
of these categories, measures (as manual plantation, and plow avoidance), will be adopted to avoid
disturbance in more than 10% of these areas,
 The “Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality in A/R CDM project
activities” version 01, is not applicable to this Grouped Project, once the tool states in its second
applicability condition: ""This tool is not applicable to small - scale afforestation and reforestation project
activities"". Therefore, the project participants shall demonstrate that the Grouped Project is additional
using an approved standardized baseline applicable to their project (as described in AR-AMS0007,
paragraph 15) and the ""VT0001: Tool for the Demonstration and Assessment of Additionality in VCS
Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) Project Activities, v3.0""
a) AFOLU activities the same or similar to the proposed project activity on the land within the proposed
project boundary performed with or without being registered as the VCS AFOLU project shall not lead to
violation of any applicable law even if the law is not enforced;
Rationale: The Grouped Project is in line with all the national environmental laws and regulations, in
particular we can emphasize the following:
- Law No. 12.651 of 25 May 2012 establishing the law on the protection of native vegetation: With the
Grouped Project the land owners will be able to go against common practice in the area and begin the
process of environmental readjustment;
- Law No. 6938 of 31 August 1981 establishing the National Environmental Policy: which provides in its
Article No. 2, the environmental improvement and quality, which will be achieved through the restoration
of degraded areas;
- Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil 1988: which in his article No. 225, the community ensures
an ecologically balanced environment, which will be achieved through the restoration of degraded areas;
- Law No. 9.433 of January 8, 1997 establishing the National Water Resources Policy: which foresees in its
Article No. 02 to ensure the quality and quantity of water for future generations and Article No. 32 foresees
the recovery of water resources and, consequently, of their sponsors ( such as Permanent Preservation
Areas, springheads and hilltops);
- Law No. 9.985 of 18 July 2000 establishing the National System of Conservation Units which in its article
No. 04 provides the restoration of ecosystems as its objective;
- Law n ° 11.428 of 22 September 2006 establishing the Atlantic Forest Law: it provides in its Article No. 1
protection, conservation and regeneration of the Biome;
- Law No. 12.187 of 29 December 2009 establishing the National Climate Change Policy: which provides in
article 04 the strengthening of anthropogenic removals by Greenhouse Gases sinks in the country;
v3.1 60

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
- Bahia State Law No. 12.050 of 7 January 2011 establishing the State Policy on Climate Change: which
provides in its Article 4, section III the reduction of the growth rate of emissions of greenhouse gases and
the capture and storage of these gases;
- Decision 9/CP.4: Adoption of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change - which provides restoration activities under the agreement.
b) The use of this tool to determine additionality requires the baseline methodology to provide for a stepwise
approach justifying the determination of the most plausible baseline scenario. Project proponent(s)
proposing new baseline methodologies shall ensure consistency between the determination of a baseline
scenario and the determination of additionality of a project activity.
Rationale: The most plausible baseline scenario of this Grouped Project is based on the baseline stepwise
described in the AR-AMS-0007, version 3.0 (details in section 2.4).
 For the “Estimation of non-CO GHG emissions resulting from burning of biomass attributable to an A/R 2
CDM project activity” version 04.0.0, whether during the period of the Grouped Project fire happens, this
tool will be applied following the below conditions:
a) The tool is applicable to all occurrence of fire within the project boundary.
Rationale: The use of fire does not make part of the project activities, notwithstanding whether during the
period of the Grouped Project fire happens within the project boundary (details in section 1.9), this tool will
be applied.
b) Non-CO GHG emissions resulting from any occurrence of fire within the project boundary shall be 2
accounted for each incidence of fire which affects an area greater than the minimum threshold area
reported by the host Party for the purpose of defining forest, provided that the accumulated area affected
by such fires in a given year is ≥5% of the project area.
Rationale: Whether during the period of the Grouped Project fire happens in an area greater than the
minimum threshold area reported by the host Party, this tool will be applied to calculate at PAI level the
estimation of non-CO GHG emissions resulting from burning of biomass attributable to the project activity. 2
 For the “Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks in dead wood and litter in A/R CDM
project activities” version 03.0, there are no applicability conditions that the Grouped Project should meet,
but assumptions to be considered. Therefore, no analysis is presented.
 For the “Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in A/R CDM project
activities” version 04.0, there are no applicability conditions that the Grouped Project should meet, but
assumptions to be considered. Therefore, no analysis is presented.
 For the “Estimation of the increase in GHG emissions attributable to displacement of pre-project
agricultural activities in A/R CDM project activity” version 02.0, the only applicability condition is if ""the
displacement of agricultural activities is expected to cause, directly or indirectly, any drainage of wetlands or
peat lands"". Since this situation is not expected to happen under the Grouped Project area, therefore this
tool is not applicable.

The Bago Region REDD+ Program is a grouped project that deploys a baseline developed for the Bago
Region administrative jurisdiction. It strengthens the government’s capacity and the community-
government relationship to reduce deforestation and forest degradation in Bago Region. The Bago
Region is an administrative region in Myanmar that includes the four Districts of Bago, Pyay,
Tharrawaddy and Taungoo. The forest areas included in this grouped project are Reserve Forests,
Protected Public Protected Areas which are subject to unplanned deforestation and degradation due
to subsistence-based activities, illegal over extraction on areas designated as plantations within the
Reserve Forests and other illegal drivers.
The first Project Activity Instance of this grouped Program is the priority area of North Zamari, which
is a newly created Wildlife Sanctuary of 72,695 hectares in the Tharrawaddy District. The North Zamari
Wildlife Sanctuary (NZWS) is where the Forest Department is implementing its first forest conservation
project with resources from the Korea-Myanmar Joint REDD+ Program. The objective is to add
additional Project Activity Instances as more funding is secured and the project can demonstrate it
can reduce deforestation, conserve and enhance forests and support forest-reliant communities in
sustainable development.
The NZWS Project Activity Instance is located in the Bago Mountain Range in the Bago Region in central
Myanmar, roughly equidistant between the economic powerhouse of the city of Yangon and the
political capital of city of Nay Pyi Taw. The NZWS Project Activity Instance encompasses what was the
North Zamari Reserve Forest, a bastion of biodiversity in a mountain range subjected to decades of
unsustainable logging. In 2014 under The Protection of Wildlife and Conservation of Natural Areas Law
(The State Law and Order Restoration Council Law No. 6/94 - 8th June, 1994 ), the Reserve Forest was
designated officially as a Protect Area of the type “Wildlife Sanctuary” which on paper demonstrated
the intent to protect the abundant biodiversity in the area, however clearing of forest land has
persisted, driven by a massive expansion in Myanmar’s economy following the country’s transition to
an open democracy, increased forest access and the conversion of forest land into agricultural
production. The Bago Region REDD+ Program ultimately aims to promote sustainable development in
the region, reducing deforestation and protecting biodiversity while also fundamentally improving the
livelihoods of the local communities.
The Program is being implemented by Forest Department of Ministry of Natural Resources and
Environmental Conservation (Forest Department), with support from the Korean Forest Service and
Terra Global. Within the Forest Department, an entity called the Program Management Unit (PMU) is
dedicated to support the Program establishment and implementation. As the Program
implementation advances a dedicated entity called the Bago Region REDD+ Entity (RMU) will be
developed and staffed to oversee implementation of the initial Project Zone Instance and most likely
further instances.
The initial Program Activities are focused in the NZWS Project Zone Instance which is the area of
impact and influence around the NZWS Project Activity Instance. This zone has been developed based
on communities located near NZWS Project Zone Instance, mobility and access, analysis of expected
short and medium-term outcomes from implementation and how these will lead to desired social
impacts for stakeholders and long-term climate and biodiversity impacts.
Beyond the conversion of the area to a Wildlife Sanctuary, the project activities to be implemented
within the NZWS Project Zone Instance are designed to reduce deforestation through improved
governance and enforcement as well as social programs to address the main drivers, agents and

underlying causes of deforestation. Specific project objectives include, 1) Empowered REDD+ PMU
(REDD+ Entity) with independent, functional fiscal and program management capacity, 2)
Communities aware of the REDD+ Program and actively engaged in planning and implementation, 3)
Project Area with clear boundaries and land tenure secure recognized by local communities, 4) Fully
trained and functional local Forest Department with regular patrolling and long-term management
plans, 5) Increased forest conservation and improved land management in Project Zones Instances, 6)
Increased efficiency for communities use of wood energy and increase supply, 7) Agricultural
efficiency and yield increased with intensification and crop diversification, 8) NTFP and handicraft
cooperatives established and generating incremental income through sale of products, 9) Program
data collection and monitoring system established and all stakeholders developed with sufficient
capacity, 10) Validation conducted in participatory manner to support management and achieve a
Validated REDD+ Project Document, 11) Monitoring and verification conducted in participatory
manner to support management and achieve VCUs, 12) Marketization and Operationalization of
REDD+ Carbon Assets.
These objectives and their related activities are intended to address the key drivers of deforestation
and forest degradation including shifting cultivation for agriculture, charcoal production, illegal
logging, and fuelwood gathering.
The emission reductions generated from the climate component of the NZWS Project Activity Instance
will be used to provide revenue to support the climate, community, and biodiversity objectives. The
main objectives are three-fold: 1) mitigation of climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions
from land-use activities that result in deforestation and degradation, 2) improve community
livelihoods, especially for women and minorities, by strengthening community land-use rights and
through alternative livelihood activities and carbon finance, and 3) contribute to the conservation of
biodiversity by protecting existing forests and the ecosystems and communities they support.",1848,1848_ccb_proj_desc_eng_1848_08may2020.pdf,project_description,"{'project_state_province': 'Bago Region', 'project_country': 'Myanmar'}","What is the project province, country, latitude, and longitude of this project?","{'project_state_province': 'Bago Region', 'project_country': 'Myanmar', 'project_latitude': 20.5, 'project_longitude': 97.25}"

2.2 Justification of the choice of the methodology and why it is applicable to the
project activity:
The applicability criteria of the methodology AMS-I.D. and their relevance with
respect to the project activity under consideration are addressed as follows:
1. “This category comprises renewable energy generation units, such as
photovoltaics, hydro, tidal/wave, wind, geothermal and renewable biomass, that
supply electricity to and/or displace electricity from an electricity distribution system
that is or would have been supplied by at least one fossil fuel fired generating unit.”
The project activity involves the setting up of wind farms, i.e., renewable generating
units of cumulative generation capacity 7.5 MW to harness a renewable source of
energy (wind power potential) and export the generated electricity to the fossil fuel
dominated electricity generation and distribution system, i.e. the Southern Regional
Electricity Grid of India9. In the process, an equivalent quantum of electricity that
would have been generated by the grid in line with the grid electricity generation mix
is displaced by the project activity. The carbon intensity of the fossil-fuel dominated
generation mix of the grid is evident from the following break-up of various types of
energy sources constituting the grid-mix contributing electricity to the Southern Grid
system.
Table 7: Power Generation mix of southern regional grid of India
Sourc : Central Electricity authority10 as on 31/01/2009
*From Wind Energy Sources as on 30/09/200811
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
2. “If the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a
wind/diesel unit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small-scale CDM project activity
applies only to the renewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel, the
capacity of the entire unit shall not exceed the limit of 15MW”.
The project activity involves only wind power generation. The gross wind power
generation capacity of the bundled project activity is 7.5 MW, which is less than 15
MW, as stipulated in the applicability criterion under consideration.
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
3. “Combined heat and power (co-generation) systems are not eligible under
this category”
The project activity involves generation of electricity only through WTGs and is not a
co-generation system.

VCS Project Description
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
4. “In the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy
generation units at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added
capacity of the units added by the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be
physically distinct from the existing units.”
The project activity does not involve the addition of renewable energy generation
units at an existing renewable power generation facility.
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
5. “Project activities that seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for
renewable energy generation are included in this category. To qualify as a small
scale project, the total output of the modified or retrofitted unit shall not exceed the
limit of 15 MW”
The renewable energy generating wind-farms employed by the project activity are
newly constructed set up and does not involve retrofitting or modification of any
existing facility for renewable energy generation.
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
Thus, the project activity fulfills all the applicability criteria of the simplified small scale
methodology AMS-I.D./ Version 1412.",357,357_vcs_pd_7.50_mw_bundled_wind_power_project_in_tamil_nadu_&_karnataka.pdf,sector,{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'},"What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?",{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}

This project is developed under the requirements of Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use
(AFOLU) projects. Specifically, the project category is “Avoided Unplanned Deforestation &
Degradation” (AUDD) for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD).
G1.3 Guatemala is among the 19th megadiverse countries in the world, with 33.7% of forest
cover land. Its native forest contribute significantly to the livelihood of local populations. About a
third of the national territory has been declared a protected area. The multicultural richness of the
country, together with traditional and ancestral knowledge of the inhabitants, constitutes a
potential for climate change projects.
The project zone is included in the Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) Selva Maya Corridor, which
contains the second most extensive tract of continuous tropical rainforest in the Americas after
the Amazon Forest, where Selva Lacandóna and Sierra del Lacandón (Mexico/Guatemala) are
one of the four keys biodiversity areas1. The Sierra del Lacandón National Park (SLNP) is one of
the seven nucleuses of the Mayan Biosphere Reserve (MBR) which represents almost 20% of
the surface of Guatemala and about 60% of the surface inside the Guatemala System of Natural
Protected Areas (SIGAP as per Sistema Guatemalteco de Áreas Protegidas). Within the borders
of the SLNP there are at least 29 archaeological sites from the Mayan Civilization, including the
monumental city of Piedras Negras2.
The SLNP is the second largest National Park in Guatemala. It has been characterized, along
with the Mirador-Rio Azul National Park, as the region of greatest plant diversity within the MBR.
The rugged terrain and rainfall, higher than the rest of the reserve, give it unique characteristics. It
has outstanding archaeological remains of the classical and pre-classical Maya civilization3.
The Lacandón – Forest for Life (Bosques para la Vida) REDD+ Project (hereinafter Lacandón
REDD+ Project) focuses on reduce deforestation that is being exerte by different agents on the
forest region by improving living condition of the communities located within the National Park
and surrounding areas. Through implementation of project activities, the environmental function
of the diverse ecosystems will be maintained, the cultural tangible heritage will be preserved and
greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and degradation processes will be prevented.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
VCS Version 3, CCB Standards Third Edition
According to the Guatemalan Law, the Guatemalan National Council for Protected Areas
(CONAP, as per Consejo Nacional de Áreas Protegidas) is the Governmental body responsible
for the management of the area4. CONAP awarded in 1999 the co-management of the SLNP with
the Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) Fundación Defensores de la Naturaleza (FDN).
The patterns of deforestation and their associated agents and drivers in the area have been
identified and understood. The importants factors are the increase of human population linked to
the expansion of agropecuarian activities and forest fires due to slash and burn forest method,
illegal logging, lack of public institutions presence in the field, illegal settlements and extraction of
natural resources (hunting and non-timber forest products as the xate palm - Chamaedorea sp).
The project will analyse, design and implement measures that will result in lower deforestation
rates while includes the deforestation agents in activities that enhance the integrated
maintenance of the natural resources and the archeological sites. The project activities will pay
special attention to the specific social and cultural issues and will incorporate these
characteristics in the management plans considering at the same time, the specific biodiversity
and climate characteristics of the region.
G1.2 The project’s community objectives takes into account the strengthening of local
governance; supporting the development of sustainable economic and livelihoods alternatives
through training and technical workshops; enhancing local administrative capacity, leadership
capacity and environmental awareness through training activities. The project activities are based
on community dialog, education and training.
The climate objectives will be covered through the implementation of activities to reduce
deforestation and forest degradation by decreasing illegal timber extraction and assuring legality
of land use right through forest sustainable management. These activities will help reduce GHG
emissions and will increase carbon stocks over time.
Although deeper understanding of the biodiversity occurring in the project region is still needed,
the presence of species classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of
Nature (IUCN) has been well documented. Examples are Jaguar – Panthera onca (Near
threatened), Tapir – Tapirus bairdii (Endangered) and Pecari - Tayassu pecari (Vulnerable) for
fauna; and Cedro – Cedrela odorata (Vulnerable) and Caoba – Swietenia macrophylla
(Vulnerable) for flora. The project’s biodiversity objectives focusing on preserving endangered
species and their habitats as compared to baseline scenario conditions through communal
forestry resources management, forest protection and biodiversity programs.
Given the high natural and cultural values present in the region, it is of utmost importance to
identify the environmental and economic context that surrounds the processes of deforestation
currently occurring in the area. The agents and drivers of deforestation have been identified
through literature review and workshops conducted with representatives of institutions.
The project activities will focus on identifying, prioritizing and executing actions for the adequate
management of the environmental and cultural resources and achieve their most effective and
efficient conservation, while benefiting the sustainable development of the region.

The approved methodology ACM0002 is applicable to the project activity, because:
a. The Project is a newly-built 49.5MW grid-connected renewable energy (i.e. wind power) power
plant at a site where no renewable power plant was operated prior to the implementation of the
project activity.
b. The Project does not involve an on-site switch from fossil fuels to a renewable source.
Therefore, the baseline methodology ACM0002 (version 12.1.0) is applicable to the project
activity.

India is among the second largest producer of rice with the production of 104.80 million tonnes
(in 2015) and productivity of 2390 Kg/ha. The production has now reached to 120 million
tonnes in 2021-22. Moreover, rice is grown in 43.86 million ha of total area, accounting for the
largest area under cultivation.
The rice growing areas can be
grouped in 5 regions: Northern
region, Eastern region, North-
eastern region, Western region,
and Southern region8.
Currently, the project is being
implemented in the state of
Haryana. However, as it is a
grouped project, new areas
from the rice producing states
can be added in the future
instances.

The consolidated methodology (ACM0012, Version 04.0) is for the following type of project
activities:
The consolidated methodology is applicable to project activities implemented in an existing or
Greenfield facility converting waste energy carried out in identified Waste Energy Carrying
Medium (here after WECM) stream(s) into useful energy. The WECM stream may be an energy
source for:
 Generation of electricity;
 Cogeneration;
 Direct use as process heat source;
 Generation of heat in element process;
 Generation of mechanical energy; or
 Supply of heat of reaction with or without process heating.
This project is a cogeneration project using waste gas from Hyundai steel mill, so the proposed
project complies with the Methodology.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
In the absence of the project activity, the WECM stream:
(a) Would not be recovered and therefore would be flared, released to atmosphere, or remain
unutilized in the absence of the project activity at the existing or Greenfield project facility; or
(b) Would be partially recovered, and the unrecovered portion of WECM stream would be flared,
vented, or remained unutilized at the existing or Greenfield project facility.
For the proposed project, in the absence of the project activity, the WECM stream used in the
proposed project would not be recovered and will be vented after incineration.

This project is being registered under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) as a Reducing Emissions from
Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) project and has been developed in compliance with the Verified
Carbon Standard1, Version 3.3 and VCS AFOLU Requirements2. The project will reduce emissions from
unplanned frontier deforestation.
As only 21.9% of the project area boundary is within 50 meters of land that has been anthropogenically
deforested3 within the 10 years prior to the project start date, location analysis (i.e. spatial modeling of
future deforestation) is required, as stipulated in the VM0007 methodology. Further, almost all forest
patches within the project area exceed 1,000 hectares.

The Afognak carbon project and the crediting period start dates are the start of the calendar year
closest to the initial acquisitions. As detailed in Section 7, the Waterfall parcel and timber rights to
Laura Lakes Tract B parcel were acquired Dec. 19, 2005. The Shuyak and Uganik parcels and the
remaining timber harvesting rights for Laura Lakes Tract A were acquired July 17, 2009. Therefore the
project start date is selected as January 1, 2006 for simplicity and annualized tracking.
The crediting period starts on the project start date; however note that the baseline scenario has a
conservative assumption of harvesting on the initially acquired properties beginning in 2008 (when the
project will first generate VCU’s). This partially reflects an assumption of some lead-time in the
baseline to implement harvesting plans, and also recognizes the secondary acquisitions in 2009. This
assumption is conservative and leads to less credits being claimed by the project over the project
lifespan.
Project Start Date: January 1, 2006
Crediting Period Start Date: January 1, 2006 (first credit issuance Dec. 31, 2008).

land-use and management practices and receives inputs listed in appendices 1 and 2 to the
methodology.
The project land does not contain organic soils as demonstrated above. Further, all planting sites
with existing shrubs will be slashed. The slashed litter will remain on site as organic mulch. No
ploughing is done as part of the reforestation project activity; the soil is only disturbed to prepare
the planting pit. Contour bunds and trenches in the project area, which have been dug by the

""Small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM"" are those that are
expected to result in net anthropogenic greenhouse gas removals by sinks of less than 8
kilotonnes of CO per year and are developed or implemented by low-income communities and 2
individuals as determined by the host Party (5/CMP.1, Annex, paragraph 1(i)).
This definition was amended at COP/MOP 3 to increase the 8 kilotonne limit to 16 kilotonnes:
""Small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM"" are those that are

VCS Project Description
The wind power project is situated in a backward area having wasteland. The project activity created
employment opportunities in these areas during construction phase and now also creating during
operation and maintenance of the Wind Turbine Generators. Creation of employment opportunities in
rural areas has long been recognized as a major concern for sustainable development and to stem the
mass exodus from rural to urban areas. This concern has formed the cornerstone of most of
Government of India’s rural development programmes. To that extent, the activity directly addresses a
core national concern.
Economic well being
• The project activity results in generation of additional employment opportunities directly and
indirectly which helps improving the standard of living of the people in and around the project
activity location.
• The project contributes to the economic sustainability around the plant site which is promotion of
decentralization of economic power.
• Carbon Revenue would provide financial incentives, which encourage channelling more
investment into cleaner energy projects and also result in improved returns to the project
stakeholders.
• It also promotes industrial growth by catering to the energy needs arising out of the supply-
demand gap of electricity.
Environmental well being
• The wind energy based electricity generation helps in less fossil-fuel burning in the system and
thus less GHG emissions in the atmosphere. Use of renewable energy source (wind energy) also
helps in conservation of natural resources like coal and petroleum fuels.
• As wind power projects produce no end products in the form of solid waste (ash etc.), they
address the problem of solid waste disposal encountered by most other sources of power. Also as
there is no fuel used for electricity generation, there aren’t any effluents discharged into the water.
Technological well being
• Wind farm ‘marks step towards cleaner and inexhaustible source of energy’
• The project proponent has taken up an important step by introducing state-of-the-art wind energy
technology",301,301_v-3-i-01-s-0021_-_pcc_0.7mw_grouped_wind_power_project_by_umedica_vcs_pd.pdf,sector,{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'},"What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?",{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}

1.13 Additional Information Relevant to the Project
Eligibility Criteria
The grouped project is expected to include instances that apply any kind of ARR technology within the
geographical region of the Grouped project. These may be either FMNR and EP activities (as applied in
the first instance) or the establishment of other technologies such as agroforestry systems or wood lots
for the production of firewood and other products.
At the time of the preparation of this PD only two instances are envisaged:
• Jama-Urji Farmers Managed Forestry Project: Which applies FMNR and EP technologies and it
is planned to a sufficient level of detail to enable its validation;
• Galo Hirphe project: This project It is located in the rift valley, 170 km from Addis Ababa, South-
East Ziway town. This instance is still in early stages of development, and it is not planned to a
sufficient level of detail to include in this version of the PD.
Since the initial instance (which is the only planned instance of the grouped project) consists in the
establishment of FNMR and EP within Ethiopia, in the current version of the PD, these will be the only
technologies and geographical region covered by the framework of this grouped project.
Additional technologies might be added in the future such as Agroforestry activities or wood lots with
commercial species in other areas. Instances using other technologies are not part of this grouped project
and would have to be included within the Grouped Project through a Project Description deviation and by
completing the description of the technology and measure within this PD.

Ecological impact
The proposed wind farm is located in an area of natural grassland. During the construction period, some
vegetation will be affected, but this will be restored within a short period. The installation height of the
turbines is lower than 100m, so there is not expected to be any significant effect on birds’ migration. The
space between the turbines is 200m-300m, which will therefore not significantly affect bird flight.
Meanwhile, the arrangement of rotors and transmission lines, and the design of the blades’ shape, colour,
quantity and size has also been considered to match as far as possible the surrounding natural landscape
and the local construction style. In conclusion, the construction work of this proposed project is not
expected to affect the local ecological environment.
Given the environment of the project location, there is very little wildlife at the site, and no protected
species has been detected. Therefore, there is no significant impact by the Project on the local ecology.

214,sector,"A.4.2. Type and category(ies) and technology/measure of the small-scale project activity:
Since the capacity of the wind farm project is 9 MW, which is less than the maximum qualifying capacity
of 15 MW, the project falls under the UNFCCC small-scale CDM project activity categories under Type-I
with project activity being renewable electricity generation for a grid.
Sectoral Scope: 1 – Energy Industries (renewable-/non-renewable sources)
Type: I -Renewable Energy Projects
Category: I.D “Grid connected renewable electricity generation”
As per paragraph 1 under Category I.D of Appendix B of the UNFCCC-defined simplified modalities
and procedures (M&P) for small-scale CDM project activities (Version 10: 23rd December 2006)
Type I.D “comprises renewables, such as photovoltaics, hydro, tidal/wave, wind, geothermal, and
biomass, that supply electricity to an electricity distribution system that is or would have been supplied by
at least one fossil fuel or non-renewable biomass fired generating unit”. The project is a grid-connected
wind based power plant and qualifies as a Category I. D project activity.
The technology consists of conversion of the energy available in the wind flow to mechanical energy
using a wind turbine. By connecting the turbine to a generator, the mechanical energy is converted into
electricity energy. Therefore, in this process, there are no greenhouse gas emissions or burning of any
fossil fuels. Thus electricity is generated through sustainable means without causing any negative effect
on the environment and hence the technology is environmentally safe and sound.
The project employs the use of wind energy for the purpose of electricity generation. Since, the
technology employed by the project proponent does not result in GHG emissions; the project does not
cause any negative effects on the environment. Hence, the technology used for the project activities do
not pose any threat to the environment when compared to the fossil fuel-fired power plants.

Qianbei Afforestation Project (hereafter refer to as “the project”) is located in Zunyi City, Guizhou Province
of China. It is an inland province, bordering Yunnan to the west, Sichuan to the northwest, Hunan to the
east and Chongqing to the North. The province has a total population of 34 million. The project aims to
plant native species on barren lands for GHG removal whilst contributing to local sustainable
development goals. 50,061 ha (750,915Mu12) of the forest was planted on barren lands in Zunyi City
which used to be poor sustainable ecological environment and karst rocky desertification.The project
involves including 1 district and 7 counties: Bozhou district, Tongzhi county, Suiyang county, Zheng’an
county, Daozhen county, Wuchuan county, Meitan county and Xishui county, with a total population of
nearly 7,800,000. All the barren lands for afforestation activities belong to the villagers and the village
committees manage the lands on behalf of villagers. Guizhou Xinzhanxin Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd.
(hereafter referred to as Guizhou Xinzhanxin) has been fully authorized by all the village committees to
act as the project proponent to implement project management and monitoring, and to sell VCUs
generated from the project so that Guizhou Xinzhanxin consolidate the offset resources into sizeable
forestry offset projects. Guizhou Xinzhanxin will profit-share with the villagers from selling VCUs. The
implementation of the project activity has provided 16,339 jobs for local villagers, among which 70
percent are women
The project activity aims to:
- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate change;
- Enhance biodiversity conservation by increasing the connectivity of forests;
- Improve soil and water conservation in the Karst region;
- Generate income and job opportunities for local communities.
There is no natural renewal and reforestation before the project, and all sites were covered by the barren
hill and degraded lands. The main objective species are China fir, Cypresses, Pinus yunnanensis and
Masson pine which are native species according to the baseline survey.

The project area includes four main coastal zones, Kampot, Kep, Preah Sihanouk, and KhoKong
and the inland areas where mangroves grow in Cambodia. The four coastal zones where the
project will be mainly carried out have multiple Community Fisheries (Cfi), and within these Cfi
boundaries include existing mangrove areas. Also, in the case of Inland areas where mangroves
grow have multiple Community Forestry (CF) to manage the mangrove forest. However, many Cfis
and CFs with mangroves are expriencing a decrease in mangrove forests and most Cfis still have
coastal areas where further expansion of mangrove forests is possible. Also, CFs with mangroves
have degraded mangrove areas that need reforestation or management.
As the first instance of grouped project, it covers 100 ha of afforestation areas that are
expandable within the Cfi area of Kampot and Kep province. Both are coastal provinces located

Fisheries in Kampot are Trapeang Ropov, Preak Tnaot, Changhaon, Kep Thmei, Toteung Tngai,
Trapeang Sangkae, Kampong Samaki, Kaoh Kruesna Lork. Community Fisheries in Kep are Ou
krasar, Kampong tralach, Phum thmei, Kep, Angkaol.
The area of the afforestation for each Cfi is calculated through GIS analysis. The selection and
calculation of the area that meets the afforestation requirements were carried out by conducting
interviews with residents and getting information from Fisheries Cantonment (FiC), a local
stakeholder. The requirements for the afforestation selection are as follows. 1) The lands or
coastal area where the tide flows in 2) The lands with mangroves that exist around area 3) The
lands without investment or development plans 4) The lands where soil conditions are muddy
not sandy or rocky 5) The lands where the area is exposed during the low tide season to plant
mangroves 6) The lands where natural disasters are less frequent 7) Other lands that can be
judged as areas in need of afforestation in the experience of local residents.
In addition, the project area is divided into existing mangrove areas, seagrass areas, fishing
zone areas, and private land to prevent conversion of existing land use due to afforestation. The
map of the Cfis and project boundaries in Kampot and Kep provinces where this project being
implemented can be seen in the figure 2. and figure 3. below. An afforestation plan optimized
for mangrove afforestation in the project boundary is prepared through soil analysis and tree
species investigation for afforestation areas selected within the project boundary map below.
The coordinates and area of the afforestation will finally be updated according to the new
afforestation plan within this Project Description. In addition, stratification is carried out based
on this afforestation plan to enable accurate GHG emission reduction calculations.
For another instances, other bare lands for afforestation and degraded mangrove areas for
reforestation will be identified by conducting GIS analysis and on-site visit. After then, the project
targeted area is determined through the same process as the first instance. Therefore, the area
to be scaled up in this grouped project will be updated to Project Description periodically.

Project Description: VCS Version 4.2
The project is not located within a jurisdiction covered by a jurisdictional REDD+ program.
Since this is grouped project composed by individual AFOLU projects, coordinates are being
submitted separately as a KML file.
The project will be developed on farms and ranches in the following regions in Argentina:
The Pampean region includes these provinces of Argentina: Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Córdoba,
Entre Ríos and the east of La Pampa. The Pampas region, located in the south cone of South
America (33º–35º S, 62º– 64º W), covers about 60 Mha and is part of one of the largest
prairies of the world. This fertile area is suitable for temperate field crops and livestock and is
the backbone of Argentinean agriculture (Lavado and Taboada 2009)..
The Northwestern agricultural area or dry Chaco includes these provinces: Salta, Tucumán,
the west of Chaco and Formosa, and the east of Santiago del Estero.
The Northeastern agricultural area includes these provinces: Misiones, Corrientes, and the east
of Formosa and Chaco.
Argentina has one of the 10 largest territories on the planet, covering 2.78 million km2 along
4176 km, which determines that the Argentine territory extends over various geographical
latitudes with subtropical climates in the northwest and northeast of the territory, temperate
climates in the centre and cold temperate climates in the south. Although the maximum width
is less (1,408 km), there is a great unevenness in terms of heights due to the existence of the
Andes Mountain range in the entire western cord of the territory with maximum heights of
almost 7,000 m, which descend until reaching the sea level throughout the riverine and
oceanic fringe in the east. Approximately, a third of the territory has arid and semi-arid climates,
with less than 600 mm of annual precipitation. Arid conditions occur to the west of the
Colorado River in the north of the country, and to the east throughout Patagonia. Such climatic
heterogeneity gives rise to a marked physiognomic-floristic heterogeneity within
phytogeographic provinces with 50 vegetation units as subdivisions of the phytogeographic
provinces (Fig. 2; Oyarzábal et al. 2018).

If mountainous surfaces and those permanently covered with water are excluded, Argentina
has around 160 million hectares with soils that are suitable for agricultural use (Casas 1986).
Of these, some 35 million are being cultivated with agricultural crops, an area that corresponds
to the most suitable or most fertile soils (mostly the Pampas region). This cultivated surface
corresponds almost totally to the distribution of the Mollisol Soil Order, which covers some 30
million hectares (Figure 3). The Order Mollisols includes highly fertile mineral soils, often
evolved under grassland vegetation, although it can also be associated with forests. They have
developed from various parent materials and in different climates, although they predominate
in temperate climates. Their profiles have a dark color and well-structured mollic epipedon and
15

a high base saturation of the soil surface. Mollisols are the largest soil order in Argentina,
occupying (as stated) 30% of the territory (Rodriguez et al. 2019; Rubio et al. 2019).
Fig. 3 Map of the dominant Soil Orders (US Soil Taxonomy) in Argentina (based on SAGyP-INTA).
Unlike the soils of Europe or Asia, with histories of use that go back thousands of years, but like
the soils of other parts of America or Oceania, the history of use of Argentine soils is related to
the arrival of the Spanish conquerors in the 16th century, who initially brought cattle and some
seeds for consumption by the first inhabitants. For many years, the main use pressure on the
soil occurred around the first European populated centers, and the first changes in the native
vegetation caused by the spread of livestock (cattle and horses) that lived freely began to occur.
Agriculture did not play an important role for decades, partly due to the idiosyncrasy of the
16

Project Description: VCS Version 4.2
European inhabitants who consumed some of the vegetables they grew and the meat of the
cattle they hunted in periodic forays into the fields. The original settlers were mostly nomadic
tribes, who dedicated themselves to hunting and fishing, collecting fruits, and exchanging
goods with the European invaders in periods of temporary peace (De Marco 2010).
It was not until after the end of the 19th century, with the expansion of cattle ranching
connected to exports of refrigerated meat and the subdivision of the land with fencing, that
Argentina was then, which until then had occupied a peripheral and marginal position in the
world. Since then Argentina, became one of the main world exporters of primary products, and
one of the fastest growing countries on a global scale (Hora, 2010).
Agricultural activity in Argentina was based on the use of cultivars with moderate yield
potential, especially crops such as maize whose yield increases between 1965 and 2010 were
due to crop tolerance to high planting densities (Di Matteo et al. . 2016), and use of
conventional tillage systems with moldboard and disc plows, mechanical weed control systems
(Satorre, 2005). The moderate yield potential of the main crops, added to the fact that the soils
still conserved a large part of their original fertility, led to the belief that the use of synthetic
fertilizers was not required (Lavado and Taboada, 2009), unlike what was happening in many
developing countries where the so-called ""Green Revolution"" allowed the increase in wheat and
rice production based on the greater use of nitrogenous fertilizers and agrochemicals, both
made with fossil fuels (Jain, 2010). This land use system that lasted until the end of the 20th
century generated significant losses of organic matter in the soil, between 30 and 50% of the
original, in addition to the advance of erosive processes by water and wind that led to the
development of gullies (Casas and Albarracin, 2016).
The advance of soil erosion processes, to a level of severity not experienced before, and the
higher cost of fuel, aroused the interest of producers at the end of the 20th century for
conservation tillage systems, such as low tillage systems, vertical and chisel plows, and in an
incipient form, zero tillage systems, at that time with many drawbacks to achieve effective weed
control (Satorre, 2005; Viglizzo et al. 2010). At that time some 16 million hectares were
cultivated, slightly more than 30 million tons of grains were produced, and wheat, corn and
soybeans were the main crops, accompanied by barley, sunflower and sorghum.
In the last three decades, a notable change in crop production was experienced, which
generated a doubling of the planted area, currently at 33 million hectares, and a quadrupling of
grain crop production, which exceeded 140 million tons of grain. This expansion of the planting
area took place towards the west of the Pampas, at the cost of the disappearance of pastures
for fattening cattle, and towards the Northwest of the country at the expense of high rates of
deforestation. This peak of changes took place between 2007 and 2010, when the highest
prices of agricultural commodities were reached, especially soybeans. Much of the
deforestation was for the planting of warm season grasses such as Gatton Panic and Rhodes
grass, to feed the livestock displaced to those places. On the other hand, the loss of pastures
was at the expense of the increase in the area planted with soybeans. This production model
was based on direct seeding systems (no till farming), chemical control of weeds with

The project installs a new power plant at a site where no renewable power was operated prior to
the implementation of the project activity. It meets all applicability conditions of methodology
ACM0002 (version 13.0.0) which is listed as follows:
1) The project activity is the installation, capacity addition, retrofit or replacement of a power
plant/unit of one of the following types: hydro power plant/unit (either with a run-of-river reservoir
or an accumulation reservoir), wind power plant/unit, geothermal power plant/unit, solar power
plant/unit, wave power plant/unit or tidal power plant/unit;
The project activity is the installation of a new solar power plant.
2) In the case of capacity additions, retrofits or replacements (except for capacity addition
projects for which the electricity generation of the existing power plant(s) or unit(s) is not affected):
the existing plant started commercial operation prior to the start of a minimum historical reference
period of five years, used for the calculation of baseline emissions and defined in the baseline

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: VCS Version 3
emission section, and no capacity addition or retrofit of the plant has been undertaken between
the start of this minimum historical reference period and the implementation of the project activity;
The project doesn't belong to these types, so it doesn't need to consider this applicability
condition.
3) In case of hydro power plants, At least one of the following conditions must apply:
The project activity is implemented in an existing single or multiple reservoirs, with no change in
the volume of any of the reservoirs; or
The project activity is implemented in an existing single or multiple reservoirs, where the volume
of any of reservoirs is increased and the power density of each reservoir, as per the definitions
given in the Project Emissions section, is greater than 4 W/m2 after the implementation of the
project activity; or
The project activity results in new single or multiple reservoirs and the power density of each
reservoir, as per the definitions given in the Project Emissions section, is greater than 4 W/m2
after the implementation of the project activity.
The Project is not a hydro power plant, so it doesn't need to consider this applicability condition.
4) In case of hydro power plants using multiple reservoirs where the power density of any of the
reservoirs is lower than 4 W/m2 after the implementation of the project activity all of the following
conditions must apply:
• The power density calculated for the entire project activity using equation 5 is greater than 4
W/m2;
• All reservoirs and hydro power plants are located at the same river and were designed together
to function as an integrated project1 that collectively constitutes the generation capacity of the
combined power plant;
• The water flow between the multiple reservoirs is not used by any other hydropower unit which
is not a part of the project activity;
• The total installed capacity of the power units, which are driven using water from the reservoirs
with a power density lower than 4 W/m2, is lower than 15 MW;
• The total installed capacity of the power units, which are driven using water from reservoirs with
a power density lower than 4 W/m2, is less than 10% of the total installed capacity of the project
activity from multiple reservoirs.
The Project is not a hydro power plant, so it doesn't need to consider this applicability condition.
5) The methodology is not applicable to the following: Project activities that involve switching from
fossil fuels to renewable energy sources at the site of the project activity, since in this case the
baseline may be the continued use of fossil fuels at the site; Biomass fired power plants; Hydro

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: VCS Version 3
power plants that result in new reservoirs or in the increase in existing reservoirs where the power
density of the power plant is less than 4W/m2.
The Project is a new grid-connected solar power plant, therefore: The Project doesn't involve
switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources at the site of the project activity; The
Project isn't a biomass fired power plant; The Project isn't a hydro power plant. So it doesn't need
to consider this applicability condition.
6) In the case of retrofits, replacements, or capacity additions, this methodology is only applicable
if the most plausible baseline scenario, as a result of the identification ofbaseline scenario, is the
continuation of the current situation, i.e. to use the power generation equipment that was already
in use prior to the implementation of the project activity and undertaking business as usual
maintenance.
The project doesn't belong to these types, so it doesn't need to consider this applicability
condition.

reduce net GHG emissions on cropland and grassland by increasing carbon stocks in soils and
woody biomass and/or decreasing CO2, N2O and/or CH4 emissions from soils. The project area
shall not be cleared of native ecosystems within the 10-year period prior to the project start date.
In the ALM category, this project falls under the following activity group:
Improved Cropland Management (ICM): This category includes practices that reduce net GHG
emissions of cropland systems by increasing soil carbon stocks and reducing soil N2O emissions.
Among these groups, this project focuses on practices that increase soil carbon stocks by
increasing residue inputs to soils and/or reducing soil carbon mineralization rates and introduction
of agroforestry practices.",3595,"3595_agroforestry_system_altaverpaz,_guatemala_-_pd_project_listing_v1-0.pdf",sector,{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'},"What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?",{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}

The following is confirmed:   Yes    No   The project start date has been selected to be consistent with the timing through which the GHG reductions are delivered, cumulatively, from the activities undertaken.  It is also linked to the campus’ fiscal/calendar year reporting of its GHG emissions to ACUPCC/STARS or another third party GHG reporting program.  While there is no single date at which each individual EE measure were all simultaneously initiated, the project start date nonetheless represents a sensible juncture from which the GHG reductions arising cumulatively from the suite of EE measures referenced above should begin to be credited: the project start date reflects the fact that sufficient measures have been implemented to allow the project’s performance to meet the additionality performance benchmarks. 1.6 Project Crediting Period Project start date:    July 1 2012 [Month/Day/Year]  Project end date:    June 30 2022  [Month/Day/Year]  Project crediting period:    10  [Number of Years]",1375,1375_3-psu_campus_wide_pdd_final_3_17_v_1.6.pdf,project_proponents,"[{'organization_name': 'Portland State University', 'state/city': 'Portland'}]","What is the project proponents, includind organization name, phone number and email address, state/city and country of the entity responsible for managing this carbon project?","[{'organization_name': 'Portland State University', 'state/city': 'Portland'}]"

The project produces renewable energy from the combustion of rice husk and dolochar1/char will be used
as a supplementary fuel. The project falls within the small scale rating as the total generation capacity of
the new unit is 8MW, i.e. below the 15MW outlined in section ID of Appendix B of the simplified
modalities and procedures for small-scale CDM project activities. The electricity generated in the project
activity from renewable biomass would be expected to replace existing and planned generation from the
grid, the majority of which is fossil fuel based. Any increase in the scale of power generation would
require additional investment throughout the plant as the current equipments are scaled for 8MW,
therefore any new capacity installed at the site would result in a new distinct project activity.
The technology employed is available in India and in the case of the project activity some of the
technology is provided by local suppliers. The technologies employed are as per the industry norms and
are in line with the consents from pollution control board and meet the local and national environmental

The project falls under scope 14 of the VCS, Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU).
SALM component
The project activities fall under the category “Agricultural Land Management (ALM) according to
the VCS AFOLU Requirements v3.4, 2013. Eligible ALM activities are those that reduce net GHG
emissions on cropland and grassland by increasing carbon stocks in soils and woody biomass
and/or decreasing CO2, N2O and/or CH4 emissions from soils.
Under the ALM, this project falls under the activity category: Improved Cropland Management
(ICM). This category includes practices that demonstrably reduce net GHG emissions of cropland
systems by increasing soil carbon stocks, reducing soil N2O emissions, and/or reducing CH4
emissions. Among these, the project focuses on the following:
a) Practices that increase soil carbon stocks by increasing field residue inputs to soils
and/or reducing soil carbon mineralization rates, and introduction of agroforestry
practices.
b) Practices that reduce N2O emissions by improved fertilizer management through
reduction in total nitrogen additions by substitution with compost manure, timely
application and improved placement.
REDD+ component
The AFOLU category is Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD).
The REDD Project activity type is Avoided Unplanned Deforestation (AUD), since the land in the
project is not legally authorized or documented to be converted to non-forest in the baseline.
The entire project is a grouped project as defined by the VCS Standard (version 4.2): “grouped
projects are projects structured to allow the expansion of a project activity subsequent to project
validation. Validation is based upon the initial project activity instances identified in the project
description. The project description sets out the geographic areas within which new project
activity instances may be developed and the eligibility criteria for their inclusion. New instances
meeting these pre-established criteria may then be added to the project subsequent to project
validation”.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
The project area is located in the rural region of Tehuantepec in Oaxaca, Mexico, where agriculture
activities are carried out mainly for sorghum sale. The land and the surroundings of the project area are
natural with a small surface water body passing through the eastern adjacent areas, which grows during
rainy season. The nearest town of “Santo Domingo Ingenio” is located 3.7 km from the project
boundaries. The project area covers an extension of 577 hectares, in which only 3.1% are to be used for
construction. The land is owned and will remain under the ownership of the different parties for
agricultural and livestock pasture uses. No significant environmental or socio-economic effects will be
caused upon completion of construction and throughout the operational life of the wind farm. The project
is generating power to offset the combustion of thousands of tonnes of fossil fuels and, in doing so, will
help preserve non-renewable resources by promoting the exploitation and use of renewable resources
and technologies. Therefore, the proposed project activity is primarily implemented for power generation,
and not with the purpose to create GHG emissions and their subsequent reduction, removal or
destruction.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF THE FIRST GROUP OF INSTANCES:
The first group of instances will be located in the La Libertad department, Sanchez Carrión province, Chugay
district, including a total of 166.74 ha, belonging to 30 producers. From this area, the first 90.02 ha will be
forested in the first year of the project.
Each instance of project activity has been identified and a polygon defined using a GPS. The geographical
coordinates of the boundaries of each of the units includes a georeferencing process including UTM
coordinates with WGS 1984 S horizontal projection. This information is stored in a database data processed
and defined in ARCGIS Desktop4. Subsequently Digital KML files are generated, indicating the geographic
location and size of each project instance.
The following table shows the geographical location and the size of the first group of instances up to the
sector level were afforestation activities will be carried out.
Table 04: Geographic reference and size of the first group of instances
4 ARCGIS Desktop is a geographic information management software that works using GML, SHP, DXF, DWG, DGN, KML vector
formats and raster image such as MrSID, GeoTIFF, ENVI, or ECW and develops precise cartographic material.

2.2 Consultation of local stakeholders
Gaia organized a general assembly attended by all the local stakeholders of the project.

Project description: VCS Version 4.2
Additionally, GAIA meets on a weekly basis with each owner/farmer and communicates with local
stakeholders in a variety of ways including emails, WhatsApp messages and letters sent by postal
delivery and in case of urgency through direct phone calls.
Different types of stakeholders (""Project Entities"") are affected by project activities
proposed:
• farmers
• their communities
• their representatives
• A local non-profit organization
Firstly, Ms Capano Francesca presented the idea of the wheat lands project in October
2022.
The proposal was well received by all interested parties and was approved by all project
participants in the following months.
Subsequently, the NUCARO MAURO company promoted and explained the project in each
community through participatory meetings.
Farmers willing to participate voluntarily in the project have been registered for these
preliminary meetings.
Interested farmers were then visited individually in order to assess their soil suitability,
conduct a biophysical assessment of the area and determine durum wheat cultivation
patterns and seed choice.
Since the project was conceived and proposed in a participatory way, and since it is
managed by each entity in a very cooperative way, any farmer can at any time give advice or
recommendations, being the full owner of the project through his Project entity.
Indeed, farmers must properly use a ""Farmer Journal"" (a register of agricultural activities) in
which they not only write down all the agricultural activities carried out each week, but also
collect their suggestions and comments that they want to share and / or address with Gaia
and the rest of the project entities.
The stakeholder meeting took place on 15 October 2022 in Spinazzola (BA) in the PUGLIA region
and on 16 October 2022 in Cerchiara di Calabria (CS) in the Calabria region.
Project proponent explained process to stakeholders and community members regarding
VCS program validation and verification and site visit

Project description: VCS Version 4.2
of the validation / verification body. The project proposer requested all the collaboration of
VVB stakeholders during the validation process.
Summary of comments received:
The project is generally well accepted:
• Farmers are proud to be part of a climate change mitigation program.
• Farmers are grateful for this help or for seeding their lands.
• Farmers are grateful for the additional and diverse income they can use for their
children's retirement or education.
• Manufacturers have also expressed their interest in the possibility of developing
carbon sequestration projects.
• The project will help them enter this new market.
Some doubts or requests have been taken into consideration:
A. Will a truly efficient monitoring process be implemented? (Having heard of or known
about other projects led by other entities that did not include or long-term follow-up)
B. Farmers will receive training on farmland.
C. Farmers have asked for the planting of other species
In developing the project, all these questions were considered:
• A monitoring plan has been developed and the cooperative is strongly aware that long-
term monitoring is essential for the development and permanence of the project.
• Farmers will receive training courses as detailed in the Farmers Training Plan.
• The choice was made in accordance with the farmers' choice, the availability of seeds,
the availability of flour on the market.
Q. How will farmers fight against pests?
A. There is no universal solution to combat the parasite.
But the good agricultural prevention practices that will be taught to the farmer, allow to
prevent the infestation of the parcels.
The project coordinator or the agronomist responsible for training the farmers will continue
to look for solutions and inform the farmers.

384,project_description,"1.2 Project Location
The project area is slightly more than 2 million ha of savanna grassland extending northward from
the northern slopes of Mt. Kenya toward the Ethiopia border. The area consists of a series of
former Group Ranches organized under the Northern Rangelands Trust to form wildlife
Conservancies of various sizes (Fig. 1). The project zone includes the forested mountain ranges,
which are protected forest reserves, found in the center of the project area, and other pastoral
grazing lands to the east, west, and north. Private ranches on the Laikipia plateau lie to the
southwest, and a belt of commercial farms lies to the south between the project area and the
forests of Mt. Kenya National Park. The project area is bisected by the Ewaso Nyiro River, which
arises from the Aberdare Mountains 600 km to the southwest and flows from west to east,
providing the major permanent water source for the project zone.
Annual rainfall varies from 550 mm/yr in the south and west to less than 350 mm/yr in the
northeast. Soils are primarily eroded sandy loams (20-30% clay) interspersed with degraded
igneous outflows that form heavy clay “black cotton” soils (40-60% clay). The project area is
bisected by multiple volcanic intrusions that remain as a series of mountain ranges (Mathews and
Mukugodo) exceeding 2500 m elevation, and is interspersed with lava flows of various ages that
feature either rocky cinder soils not suitable for storing carbon, or “black cotton” clays which may
store significant carbon.
In the project area and in the project zone to the east, north, and west, vegetation of the sandy
loam soils consists mostly of Acacia – Commiphora savannah grassland. In the project zone,
seasonal dry forests occupy the slopes of the sky island mountain ranges, and cloud forests
occupy the highest elevations of the mountains.

The project will be a Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) project within the sectoral scope of Agriculture,
Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) and category Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR)
and Wetlands Restoration and Conservation (WRC). In terms of the WRC activity type, the project activity
aims to enhance mangrove ecosystems, and hence the WRC activity type represents RWE (Restoring
Wetland Ecosystems).
Project is NOT a grouped project.
As per Section 2.1 of VCS Standard (Version 4.2), the project is subject to the six Kyoto Protocol
greenhouse gases, aiming to reduce the carbon and other greenhouses gases (GHG) emissions by
restoring the degraded mangrove forests. Hence, it falls under the ARR category. The methodology of the
project also refers to the latest version of the following tools approved by the Clean Development
Mechanism (Version 03.0): Afforestation and reforestation of degraded mangrove habitats (AR AM0014).
In addition, as per Section 3.2.8 of VCS Standard (Version 4.2), all ARR projects occurring on wetlands
shall adhere to both the respective project category requirements and the WRC (Wetlands Restoration
and Conservation) requirements, unless the expected emissions from the soil organic carbon pool or
change in the soil organic carbon pool in the project scenario is deemed below de minimis or can be
conservatively excluded as set out in the VCS program document VCS Methodology Requirements, in
which case the project shall not be subject to the WRC requirements. For this project soil organic carbon

is an important part of the total amount of the carbon sequestrated, hence the project will comply with
both ARR requirements and WRC requirements. Upon the requirements, the periodic reassessment of

the following aspects:
• The project Pamuk HPP was commissioned in 2004 long before carbon finance was
available in Turkey.
• It was developed before the 2008 financial crisis so it was developed in a different
investment climate.
• This project is 23.7 MW so it is smaller in size than Kepezkaya Project.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
3 QUANTIFICATION OF GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND REMOVALS
3.1 Baseline Emissions
According to the latest version (version 13.0.0) of ACM0002 and the tool to calculate the emission
factor for electricity system, since the project activity is the installation of a new grid-connected
renewable power plant/unit, the baseline scenario is the following:
Electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have
otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power
plants and by the addition of new generation sources, as reflected in the
combined margin (CM) calculations described in the “Tool to calculate
the emission factor for an electricity system” (version 02.2.1 (EB63)).
The Project therefore applies the combined margin (CM) calculations described in the “Tool to
calculate the emission factor for an electricity system” (version 02.2.1 (EB63)).
Step 1 -Identify the relevant electric power system
As the host country is not participating in the compliance markets hence does not have a DNA, a
delineation of the project electricity system and connected electricity systems has not been
published yet. For such cases, the tool suggests using the following criteria to determine the
existence of significant transmission constraints:
1. “In case of electricity systems with spot markets for electricity: there are differences in electricity
prices (without transmission and distribution costs) of more than 5 percent between the systems
during 60 percent or more of the hours of the year.” This criteria is not applicable as there is no
spot electricity market in the host country.
2. “The transmission line is operated at 90% or more of its rated capacity during 90% percent or
more of the hours of the year”: The transmission line operator (TEIAS) or any other official source
has not published the capacity usage figures for the Turkish grid, hence this criterion can not be
proved.
According to the tool, where the application of these criteria does not result in a clear grid
boundary, a regional grid definition in the case of large countries with layered dispatch systems
(e.g. provincial / regional / national) shall be used. A provincial grid definition may indeed in many
cases be too narrow given significant electricity trade among provinces that might be affected,
directly or indirectly, by a CDM project activity. In other countries, the national (or other largest)
grid definition should be used by default.
Therefore, for the case of the subject project activity “the project electricity system” and “the
connected system” are same, and the Turkish National Grid is used as the “project electricity
system”. It is also confirmed by TEIAS that the Turkish grid is interconnected. There isn’t any
independent or regional grid system in any region of Turkey. The map of the Turkish Electricity
Grid is given in the below figure (Figure 10):

http://www.epdk.gov.tr/documents/10157/48dd12d4-74da-4dcf-9f48-86983146c0d8)
All the calculations details of which are given below are made for the entire Turkish Grid.
Step 2 - Choose whether to include off-grid power plants in the project electricity system
The tool requires Project participants to choose between the following two options to calculate the
operating margin and build margin emission factor:
Option I: Only grid power plants are included in the calculation.
Option II: Both grid power plants and off-grid power plants are included in the calculation.
In our case, “Option I” has been selected for the calculation of grid emission factor, and only grid
power plants are included in the calculation.
Step 3 – Select an operating margin (OM) method
According to the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system‟, version 02.2.1 in
calculating the Operating Margin grid emission factor for a given year y (EFgrid,OM, y), project
developers have the option of selecting from four methods:
(a) Simple OM,
(b) Simple adjusted OM,
(c) Dispatch Data Analysis OM, or

427,methodology,"2.2 Justification of the choice of the methodology and
why it is applicable to the project activity:
The methodology applied is Category AMS-I.E: Switch from Non–Renewable
Biomass for Thermal Applications by the User – Version 01 from February
01 of 2008 onwards which is applicable for project activities that
avoid greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable biomass in order to
generate thermal energy.
This category comprises small thermal appliances that displace the use
of non-renewable biomass by introducing new renewable energy end-user
technologies. The end-user technology in the case of this project can
be established as the project proponent, who utilizes the thermal
energy generated by the new renewable energy technology.
There are no similar registered small-scale CDM project activities in
the region of Panorama once Social Carbon Company made a research and
did not find any registered small–scale CDM Project activity in the
region. The sources of registered small-scale CDM project activity
consulted were the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC)17 and Brazilian’s Technology and Science Ministry18.
Therefore, the proposed project activity is not saving the non-
renewable biomass accounted by the other registered project activities.
The utilization of firewood from area without any kind of management
can not be considered a renewable source of biomass, since it involves
a decrease of carbon pools and increases the carbon emissions to the
atmosphere, turning green house effect even worse. Moreover, the native
wood provided from areas without a reforestation management plan does
not fit any of the options of UNFCCC definition of renewable biomass in
Annex 18, EB 23.
Furthermore, firewood has been used for many decades as fuel in Brazil.
Although, it is impossible to define a start date on which this kind of
non-renewable biomass began to be applied, there are many documents to
prove that wood has been used for thermal energy generation before 1989
as requested in the applied methodology. Firewood used to be the most
employed source of primary energy until de decade of 1970, when the
17 CDM activities registered by CDM Executive board are Available at:<
<http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/registered.html>. Accessed in January 15th, 2009.

of all CDM activities within Brazilian boundaries. CDM activities submitted to the
Brazilian Inter-Ministerial Commission of CDM Activities are available at:

Sol Nascente Ceramic VCS Project Description
petroleum started to supply the majority of Brazilian’s energy needs19.
Moreover the Brazilian’s Energy and Mine Ministry has been monitoring
every energetic sectors of Brazil since 1970, and firewood appears over
the years monitored as a significant source of thermal energy for
ceramic sector20. Especially in the ceramic sector, the use of firewood
is visible non-renewable and unsustainable, involving negative
environmental impacts associated21.
This way, it can be concluded that non-renewable biomass has been used
since 31 December 1986.
The biomasses utilized in the project, sugar cane bagasse and sawdust,
are common residues in the region generated. Bagasse is generated by
industries to produce alcohol. Each ton of sugar cane used for alcohol
production generates around 140 kg of sugar cane bagasse, which can be
either compacted into briquettes or utilized in natura for thermal
energy generation 22 . Sawdust/wood chips are resulted from wood
manufacturing.
São Paulo is a huge peanut producer and the peanut shell is a residue
generated from this production.
Sawdust, wood chips, peanut shells and sugar cane bagasse are all
industries residues coming from large scale reforestation or
agroindustrial projects, so it is considered renewable according to
option V of methodology definition of renewable biomass: “The biomass
is the non-fossil fraction of an industrial or municipal waste”.
The elephant grass is considered renewable according to option III, as
soon as it fits all the assumptions below:
“The biomass is non-woody biomass and originates from croplands and/or
grasslands where:
(a) The land area remains cropland and/or grasslands or is reverted to
forest; and
(b) Sustainable management practices are undertaken on these land areas
to ensure in particular that the level of carbon stocks on these land
areas does not systematically decrease over time (carbon stocks may
temporarily decrease due to harvesting); and
(c) Any national or regional forestry, agriculture and nature
conservation regulations are complied with.”",131,131_proj_desc_131_03aug2009.pdf,methodology,{'project_methodologies': ['AMS-I.E.']},What is the methodology of this project?,{'project_methodologies': ['AMS-I.E.']}

The Timor-Leste Mangrove Restoration Project (hereafter referred to as “the Project”) is located
in the coastal areas of six municipalities of Timor-Leste : Bobonaro, Dili, Manatuto, Baucau,
Viqueque, Manufahi. The project proponent of this project is SK Forest. The main goals of this
project are:
 To mitigate climate change by removing GHG through mangrove planting
 To restore degraded mangrove forests and improve biodiversity
 To support the livelihood of local residents through the creation of local jobs and
income generation
The project aims to restore the ecosystem and support local livelihoods by planting mangrove
trees in degraded mangrove ecosystems. Approximately 566 hectares of mangrove are to be
restored by planting mangrove seedlings in areas where mangroves have been lost in past
decades on the northern and southern coasts of Timor-Leste. According to a land cover
classification model developed through the project, mangrove forests in Timor-Leste are rapidly
decreasing, with a 4.93% yearly deforestation rate.
The selected project areas are suitable for mangrove growth, firstly determined by GIS analysis,
including tide zone analysis and mangrove habitats suitability index and field survey to confirm.
According to the interview with local communities, threats to mangroves in project areas
include seasonal sediment accumulation, illegal logging, and livestock grazing. Notably, local
communities in Baucau rely on rice cultivation for their livelihoods, making the conversion into
farmland a significant threat.
The characteristic of Timor-Leste’s mangrove forest is the zoning by the distance from the
shoreline influenced by the high tide, submerging periods, and duration. Mangrove zoning
partitions the distribution of mangrove species, forming a unique habitat. The expected planting
species and stratification are designed in accordance with the natural zoning of the mangroves.
The planting species of the project mainly consist of Rhizophora apiculata, Ceriops tagal, and
Avicennia marina. R. apiculata will be planted near the shoreline, as the species require
sufficient moisture, while C. tagal and A. marina will be planted further inland, as this species
is highly resistant to drought and salinity.
The project’s total GHG removals by sinks are estimated ex-ante as 308,020 tCO2-e over its
crediting period of 30 years at an estimated average of 10,267 tCO2-e annually. The project
applies VM0033 methodology, and the start date for the project is January 1, 2025.

1.12 Project Location
The REDD+ project to reduce emissions from avoided deforestation in the Otún River Basin Forests is
located in the southeast area of the Otún River basin of Magdalena Cauca, in rural areas of the
municipalities of Salento, Pereira and Santa Rosa de Cabal, in the western Colombian Andes region,
between coordinates 4° 45 '52,708 ""N - 4° 45' 50,975"" N and 75° 28 '32,730 ""W - 75° 35' 56,641"" W
(WGS84 coordinate system). In total, it is made up of 17 lots (see Table 9) with an area of 6,445.46 ha,
of which, 5.602,74 ha are located in the southern area of the department of Risaralda, on the border
with the department of Quindío, on which, one of the project properties is located, as can be seen in
Figure 6.
To the east, it constitutes a border area with the Los Nevados National Natural Park (PNN), where about
3,223.06 ha of the project area are located; and to the west, it borders with the Otún Quimbaya Fauna
and Flora Natural Reserve Sanctuary. The closest major city is Pereira, located approximately 12 km away
from the project area. The geographical location by lot is described on Table 9 and Figure 6 shows the
location of the project by department, as well as the expansion area (municipalities of Santa Rosa de
Cabal and Pereira).

The first tool is used for baseline calculation and second tool is used for additionality assessment. As third
tool is the combination of the first and second tool, it is not used. Since no project emission or leakage
calculation is required for wind power project, fourth tool is not used, and finally to determine the remaining
lifetime of the equipment, fifth tool is used.

1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
The project is classified under sector 14 of the VCS: Agriculture, Forestry, and other Land-uses
(AFOLU), and operates as an Afforestation, Reforestation, and Revegetation (ARR) project type.
In addition, the project has been designed as a Grouped Project, and plans to increase the number
of project instances2 over time as described in this design document. The first phase of the project
consists of the participation of 254 landholders to restore tree cover in 377 initial project instances
using 72,847 trees of various species that are native or adapted to the agro-ecological zone of the
project.
Table 1 presents the area of the initial project instances by community and land use.

1.9 Project Location
The project is constituted by the CAZ protected area and the adjacent community-managed
forests, located in the center of Madagascar´s eastern slope rainforests in the Province of
Toamasina (Figure 1). It is broadly delimited by the Zahamena National Park (center:
17°40´S, 48°50´E) to the north and the Ankeniheny Classified Forest in the commune of
Lakato to the south. The precise boundaries of the project area are defined by the limits of
the protected area, and the limits of the community management forest areas. GIS and KML
files of the project boundaries are available to the validator. The separate parcels’ ID,
coordinates of centroids, area and land tenure status are presented in Annex 3.
The project area covers 370,032 hectares and is entirely owned by the Government of
Madagascar. It is found within the regions of Alaotra-Mangoro and Atsinanana; and the
districts of Ambatondrazaka, Moramanga, Brickaville, Toamasina II and Vatomandry. The

that are Operating Margin (OM), Growth Based Margin (Build Margin-BM) and Combined Margin (CM)
Emission Factors, for the relevant year (which is 2018) with usage of the IPCC’s Clean Development
Methodology Tool 07-V06.0. For this calculation, information regarding used data set is given detailed in
section 4.1 of this document. In brief, the latest version of the Turkish National Electricity Grid Emission
Factor was published in 2018 and the Emission Factors included in this document belong to the 2018
calculation period19. So, the data of the emission factors (the data set used for calculation of emission
factors also belongs to 2018.) used in the calculation of the baseline scenario belongs to 2018.

The project activity involves generation by 24.8 MW of installation of Wind Electric Generators
(WEGs) in the state of Tamil Nadu. The project will harness the wind resource for electricity
generation and will displace the electricity generated from the grid which comprises mainly the
thermal generated resource.
The project is part of the UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism program, which is a GHG
program that has been approved by the VCS Board. Accordingly, under the VCS program, as per
the modalities and procedures for large-scale CDM project activities, the type and category of the
project activity is as under:
Sectoral Scope: 1, Energy industries (renewable/ non-renewable sources)
Project Category: ACM0002, Version-17, “Grid-connected electricity generation from
renewable sources”.
The project is a bundled project activity having four investors. The project involves a total of 31
nos. of WEGs of 800 KW each.
The project under consideration is set up to produce clean power from the wind electric
converters. The Project leads to reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because it
displaces electricity from fossil fuel based electricity generation plants. The project considered
has used the barren land in the state of Tamil Nadu. The project is helping in bridging the
demand supply gap by using wind as a source of generating electrical energy.
The bundled project activity has been developed to produce clean power from the wind energy.
The generated electricity is being wheeled using the state transmission system for captive
consumption. The Project leads to reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions because it
displaces electricity from fossil fuel based electricity generation plants.
Bundled wind power project of 24.8 MW (“Project”) has been installed in the state of Tamil Nadu.
The Project leads to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions because it displaces electricity from
fossil fuel based electricity generation plants. The Project harnesses renewable resources in the
region, and thereby displacing non-renewable natural resources thereby ultimately leading to
sustainable economic and environmental development. Wind World (India) Limited (WWIL) is the
equipment supplier and the operations and maintenance contractor for the Project.
This bundled wind power project was registered with VCSA having capacity of 36 MW which
consists of six investors. Initially the project was designed to install a total of 45 nos. of WEGs of
800 kW each. However, the subproject of Bannari Amman Spinning Mills was registered as CDM
project on 17-06-2011 (http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/DB/SIRIM1306929016.84/view). Hence, this
subproject has not been monitored in this project activity. Thus project capacity has been
reduced from 36 MW to 24.8 MW after omission of Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) belonging
to the investor Bannari Amman Spinning Mills. Presently, the project activity consists of the 31
number of E-48 machines of Wind World make of 800 kW each to the total capacity of 24.8 MW.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
The first machine under the project activity was commissioned on 26-02-2007 and the last
machine under the project activity was commissioned on 11-05-2007. The expected operational
lifetime of the project is for 20 years.
Wind World (India) Ltd (“WWIL”) is the equipment supplier and the operations and maintenance
contractor for the Project (earlier the name was Enercon (India) Ltd)1.
The project activity is located in the Indian grid which is dominated by fossil fuel fired thermal
power stations. The grid is also doomed by power deficit and hence the addition of renewable
wind energy generation will help in the sustaining and catering to the power demand.
The Project is wind based renewable energy source, zero emission power project connected to
the Tamil Nadu state grid, which forms part of the Indian regional electricity grid. The Project will
displace fossil fuel based electricity generation that would have otherwise been provided by the
operation and expansion of the fossil fuel based power plants in Indian regional electricity grid.",404,404_project_description_tr.pdf,project_description,"{'project_state_province': 'Tamil Nadu', 'project_country': 'India'}","What is the project province, country, latitude, and longitude of this project?","{'project_state_province': 'Tamil Nadu', 'project_country': 'India', 'project_latitude': 10.53, 'project_longitude': 77.42}"

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
Leakage Management
The project activity generates electricity using wind energy; therefore, it will not have any leakage as per
the applied methodology, ACM0002.
Commercially Sensitive Information
The project activity does not have any commercially sensitive information and nothing has been excluded
from the public version of the project description.
Further Information
The Project contribution for sustainable development of the Host Country has been explained below:-
Social Wellbeing
 FFC has launched a community uplift and support program at Jhimpir during 2012, focusing on
villages surrounding the Wind Farm at a cost of PKR 9.4million in partnership with NORDEX9.
 The project activity has lead to the built up of road and local infrastructure development.
Economic wellbeing
 Employment generation for local people during the construction and operational phases of the
project activity. The project activity has provided direct employment to local people during its
operation phase. This will improve the socio-economic condition of the local people.
 Pakistan is passing through an acute energy crisis. The proposed project will generate an
estimated amount of 143.6 GWh per year and will therefore contribute to a reduction in the
number of black-outs and brown-outs experienced by other grid users, which can help to improve
the economic performance of other businesses connected to the grid.
Environmental wellbeing
 The project activity produces power from wind which is clean source of energy and does not
involve any GHGs emission.
 Wind is one of the cleanest forms of renewable energy and power generation from wind does not
involve any fossil fuels.
Technological wellbeing
 The project activity uses the environmental safe and sound technologies for wind power
generation in the Country. By adopting foreign manufacturer wind turbines, the project activity will
promote important transfer of technical know-how to Pakistan, and can act as a pioneer in
promoting the spread of this technology to other wind power projects.
 Towers for the wind turbines were manufactured for the first time in Pakistan at Descon’s
workshop in Karachi; a step towards indigenization of wind power technology in the country10.

to achieve sustainable grassland management. Grazing was strictly prohibited for the
first three years, and then rotational grazing will be applied in different project areas to
protect the natural grassland resources and mitigate the degradation of the ecological
environment.
2. Degradedgrassland improvement, sandy grassland management wasalso implemented
in degraded areas, 79408 haof degraded grassland have been managed sustainably by
the implementation of seeding, reseeding and applying fertilizer, where grass seeds of
local high-quality forage were sowed such as Elymus nutans Griseb., Poa crymophila
Keng cv Qinghai, Elymus breviarystatus Keng cv Qinghai., Festuca sinensis Keng ex S.

SECTION B. Application of a baseline and monitoring methodology
B.1. Title and reference of the approved baseline methodology applied to the project activity:
>>
1. The approved consolidated baseline and monitoring methodology ACM0002: “Consolidated
methodology for grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources” Version 7, in effect as of
14 December 2007; and
2. The approved “Tool for demonstration and assessment of additionality”, Version 05.2, in effect as of
EB 39; and
3. The approved Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system, Version 01.1, in effect as
of EB 35,
are applied to the Project activity3.
More information about the methodology can be obtained at:
http://cdm.unfccc.int/methodologies/PAmethodologies/approved.html

activity:
>>
The Methodology of ACM0002 (Version 7) is chosen and applicable to the proposed project due to the
following reasons:
• The project activity is a grid-connected renewable power generation project activity that involves
electricity capacity additions in the form of wind energy.
• The project activity is connected to the North China Power Grid. The geographic and system
boundaries for this grid can be clearly identified and information on the characteristics of this grid
are available.
• The project activity does not involve switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy at the site of
the project activity.
• The project activity is not a biomass fired plant
• The project activity meets the applicability conditions of the ‘Tool to calculate the emission
factor for an electricity system’ and the ‘Tool for the demonstration and assessment of
additionality’.
The applicability criteria stated in methodology ACM0002 (Version 7) are met on the basis of the reasons
above.
3 The “Tool to calculate project or leakage CO emissions from fossil fuel combustion” Version 1, in effect as of EB 2
32, is not applied to this Project, since ACM0002 refers to this Tool for geothermal projects and the proposed
Project is a wind power project.",556,556_proj_desc_556_29oct2009.pdf,methodology,{'project_methodologies': ['ACM0002']},What is the methodology of this project?,{'project_methodologies': ['ACM0002']}

(a) Theland subjecttotheproject activitydoes notfallinwetlandcategory;
The project is implemented on agricultural lands, community lands and home backyards which
are suitable for plantation. The area in which the project activity instances are situated does
not come under the category of wetland. GIS data will be used to verify and claim that the land
parcels are not wetlands along with internal feasibility check based field visits before the
selectionofplots forplantationactivities.
(b) Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10 per cent of
area; in each of the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project
boundary:
(i) Land containingorganic soils;
(ii) Land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and receives
inputs.
Soil disturbance will be negligible in case of bund plantations. Land preparation activities are
limited to pit digging, with no tillage activity, and the soil disturbance will in no case be more
than 10%. The discrete parcels of land on which the project is implemented do not contain
organic soils. The selected agricultural plots fall under the category of cropland in the tropical
dryregion, withfull toreduced tillageactivities andwithorwithout high input asper Appendix 1
of the methodology. Since the plantations on such plots are on the bunds, the restriction does
not apply to the project. Other community plots do not fall under either of the categories
mentioned inAppendix1and 2ofthemethodology,thus,norestriction.

Miaoling Afforestation Project (hereafter refer to as “the project”) is located within Qiandongnan Miao and
Dong Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou Province of China. It is an inland province, bordering Yunnan to
the west, Sichuan to the northwest, Hunan to the east and Chongqing to the North. The province has a
total population of 34 million. The project aims to plant native species on suitable land for forest13 for GHG
removal whilst contributing to local sustainable development goals.
30,169 ha (452,535 Mu14) of forest was planted on suitable land for forest in Qiandongnan Miao and
Dong Autonomous Prefecture which used to be poor sustainable ecological environment and karst rocky
desertification. Prior to the project, the project area was suitable land for forest, there is no forestry
management and the coverage by planting trees is low, and there has never been any activity affecting
the local ecosystem15. By checking the afforestation plan with the forestry bureau of Qiandongnan, it was
confirmed that, a small number of trees have been planted in some project area before the project started,
but the coverage by planting trees is low. So considering the low forest coverage, the forestry bureau of
Qiandongnan determined that the project area is suitable for afforestation after investigation, then the
local forestry bureau approved the supplementary planting without disturbing the existing trees in January
2016 to increase the vegetative cover.
The project is to plant without disturbing the existing trees, and only the trees actually planted in the
project were monitored. The carbon credit of the original trees in the baseline scenario will not be
monitored or counted in the actual net GHG removals by sinks.
The project involves including 4 counties: Congjiang county, Rongjiang county, Liping county, Leishan
county. All suitable land for forest for afforestation activities belong to the villagers and the village
committees manage the lands on behalf of villagers. Guizhou Xinzhanxin Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd.
(hereafter referred to as Guizhou Xinzhanxin or Xinzhanxin) has been fully authorized by all the village
committees to act as the project proponent to implement project management and monitoring, and to sell
VCUs generated from the project so that Xinzhanxin consolidate the offset resources into sizeable
forestry offset projects. Guizhou Xinzhanxin will profit-share with the villagers from selling VCUs. The
13 According to the ""Chinese terms in resource and technology"" issued by the China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.
the definition of suitable land for forest refers to the land type with suitable site conditions for forest growth
programmed by People's governments at or above the county level. The suitable land for forest described in this
project is programmed by the Government of Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, and a small
number of trees have been planted in some project area before the project started but the coverage by planting trees
is low, so the Government of Qiandongnan defines the project area as suitable land for forest.

implementation of the project activity has provided 18,443 jobs for local villagers, it includes 18,355
temporary planting jobs and 88 long-term technician jobs, among which 60 percent are women. The
employment period of temporary planting workers was during the planting period of the project, from 20-
April -2016 to 20-December-2017.
The project activity aims to:
- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate change;
- Enhance biodiversity conservation by increasing the connectivity of forests;
- Improve soil and water conservation in the Karst region;
- Generate income and job opportunities for local communities.
There is no natural renewal and reforestation before the project, and all sites were suitable land for forest.
The main objective specie are China fir, Masson pine and Pinus yunnanensis which are native species
according to the baseline survey.

The initial conditions that may influence the baseline scenario and additionality (land use,
socioeconomic, biophysical and ecological conditions) are sufficiently homogeneous throughout
the eligible area of project area to justify this grouping. Conservation areas are located in a region
where there is an increase in the agricultural frontier and illegal logging, mainly due to migration,
lack of governance and few resources to implement conservation activities.

Conservation Concession TINGANA5
The TINGANA Conservation Concession, has an area of 2867.84 ha according to Executive
Directorial Resolution N° 335-2017/GRSM/ARA/DEACRN. It is in Peru, Department of San
Martin, Province of Moyobamba, Districts of Moyobamba and Yantaló, and is part of the state
property called Zona de Conservación y Recuperación de Ecosistemas (ZoCRE) Humedal del Alto
Mayo. The concession was granted by the San Martin Regional Environmental Authority to the
Asociación de Conservación de Aguajales y Renacales del Alto Mayo -ADECARAM, through the
Concession Contract for Conservation Purposes N° 22-SAM/CON-CON-2017-02.
ADECARAM was formed by the first founding partners of the venture and currently guides tourists
through the Tingana conservation area. It is a non-profit organization that works to help families
in the Tingana ecosystem improve their quality of life through the recovery, conservation and
sustainable use of ecosystem services and biological diversity. Its main activities focus on
ecotourism, as well as developing sustainable productive activities and strengthening member
enterprises.
TINGANA is located in a very humid forest-premontane ecosystem, where a landscape of
aguacales and renacales predominates. This life zones are composed of evergreen trees, some
dominant and almost all emerging are heliophilous and lose their leaves during the dry season,
flowering some very colorful, such as Erythrina, Tabebuia and Jacaranda among the most
important. It is located on the sub-basin of the Avisado River, on the left bank of the Mayo River,
constituting a community adapted to travel its territory floating on the water.
The main productive activities in the region are irrigated rice, pasture and cattle raising, coffee,
vanilla, cacao and crops such as plantain, corn, yucca and camu camu to a minor extent. Income
is also generated from aguaje extraction when it is in season and, as previously mentioned,
through ecotourism and sustainable production, such as guiding, lodging, food services,
transportation, vanilla products, regional liquors, and honey.
Despite the efforts made by the community and ADECARAM to conserve their territory, new
conservation challenges continue to emerge. The expansion of the agricultural frontier for rice
crops and livestock, the construction of trails or tertiary roads for transport, combined with a
shortage of opportunities, technical assistance, income diversification and difficulty in accessing
markets, are identified as the driving factors behind deforestation. On the other hand, the lack
of support in terms of monitoring and surveillance by the authorities has led to conflicts with the
neighboring population seeking new territories to develop their economic activities.
In this context, the project seeks to develop, within the project activities, improvements in
ecotourism activities; implement sustainable agricultural systems such as vanilla, coffee, aguaje
or other crops that improve productivity and allow diversification of productive activities; develop
awareness and education activities with the communities; and strengthen control, monitoring
and protection of the forest.

Conservation Concession “Bosques de ACOBOSAY”6
The Conservation Concession ""Bosques de ACOBOSAY"" has a granted area, according to the
Executive Directorial Resolution N° 089-2017/GRMS/ARA/DEACRN, of 4989 hectares. Located
in the department of San Martin, province of Moyobamba, district of Moyobamba, populated
centers El Alamo, Pampa Hermosa and El Higueron. The altitudinal range of the area varies
between 1,000 and 2,250 meters above sea level. This concession is part of the state-owned
Juninguillo-Yanyacu Ecosystem Conservation and Recovery Zone (ZoCRE) and is a buffer zone of
the Cordillera Escalera RCA, forming part of the Abiseo-Cóndor-Kutukú Conservation Corridor.
This concession was granted to the Asociación de Conservación de los Bosques del Yanayacu y
Yarau (ACOBOSAY) through the Concession Contract for Conservation Purposes N°22-SAM/CON-
CON-2017-001.
ACOBOSAY is a non-profit private law institution established in 2012, which brings together
agricultural and livestock producers from the El Álamo, Pampa Hermosa and El Higuerón
population groups. Its main area of work is in the Concession, and its mission is to contribute to
improving the quality of life of the population, promoting the conservation of biological diversity
and key ecosystems, encouraging the appropriate use of natural resources. They seek to develop
conservation activities such as coffee agroforestry systems, ecotourism, orchid nurseries,
productive diversification and environmental education.
The CC ""Bosques de ACOBOSAY"" is located in the Huayabamba basin, an area that is experiencing
significant conservation challenges due to the migration of people coming from the highlands
region of the country in search of land to develop agriculture. This concession is located in the
Yungas montane forest ecosystem, an important habitat for endemic flora and fauna species

such as the yellow-tailed choro monkey (Oreonax flavicauda), the Andean spectacled bear
(Tremarctos ornatus) and the Peruvian cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruviana).
The main economic activity in the region is coffee cultivation, which is the livelihood of the
families surrounding the conservation area. Other secondary activities are pasture farming and
cattle ranching. The development of a single productive activity (coffee) without technical
assistance, limited technology and low market prices has caused producers to deforest in order
to increase the number of plots and generate income. This, coupled with poor control and little
oversight of the concession boundaries, makes forest use unsustainable.
Understanding this context, the project seeks to implement, within the project activities, coffee
agroforestry systems programs focused on improving productivity, quality, market access and
governance of the coffee association, in order to improve the quality of life of producers and make
a change of land use to a sustainable model that will reduce deforestation of forests in this area.
This, together with the diversification of activities, training, educational workshops, research
activities, control and surveillance, will allow ACOBOSAY to fulfill its conservation objectives.

Conservation Concession “Los Bosques de la Bella Durmiente”7
The Conservation Concession ""Los Bosques de la Bella Durmiente"" has a granted area, according
to the Executive Directorial Resolution N° 274-2018/GRMS/ARA/DEACRN, of 2393.45 hectares.
Located in Peru, Department of San Martin, Province of Rioja, District of Pardo Miguel, high basin
of the Mayo River. The population centers within the Concession's zone of influence are Miguel
Grau, Santa Cruz, and Aguas Claras. The altitudinal range of the zone varies from 1237 meters

The Luangwa Community Forests Project is a large scale grouped REDD+ project implemented in
Eastern and Lusaka Province, Zambia with an initial project area of 943,676 ha (Figure 1). At validation,
the project is implemented on communal land in 12 chiefdoms falling within Game Management Areas
(GMA) and two private ranches. Additional project instances may be added in the future. Implementation
is in partnership with the traditional authorities and the government of the Republic of Zambia.
The project will generate emissions reductions through avoided deforestation, using the following
mitigation activities:
 Direct conservation support - Forest monitoring will be done using remote sensing, aerial and
ground monitoring. Encroachment prevention will be accomplished by training, funding, and
helping to manage community scouts.
 Engagement and capacity building with key Government and community stakeholders.
 Performance-based payments to community stakeholders delivered through local institutions.
 Promoting alternative livelihood activities including: conservation agriculture, non-timber forest
product livelihoods, and sustainable enterprise development.
The baseline scenario is unplanned deforestation driven primarily by the expansion of subsistence
agriculture. Furthermore, communities remain in an impoverished state and biodiversity declines due to
habitat loss and increased poaching.
The project’s community objective is poverty alleviation for at least 10,000 households, specifically
targeting vulnerable households and the poorest of the poor. The project also aims to promote
infrastructure development and water provision. The biodiversity objectives is maintaining a massive
wildlife corridor between five national parks in the catchment of Zambia’s 4th largest river system.
Conserving and maintaining vulnerable and endangered species through habitat protection and reduction
in poaching. The climate objectives are to avoid deforestation in the project area and assist communities
and biodiversity with climate change adaptation benefits through income diversification, improved farming
techniques, crop diversification and maintenance of habitat corridors.
The estimated emissions reductions for the 30 year project span is 83,598,204 tCO2e at an average
2,985,650 tCO2e/yr.

37

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
● 8.8 “Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all
workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious
employment”;
● 8.9 “By 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates
jobs and promotes local culture and products”.
● SDG 12: Ensure sustainable production and consumption patterns.
The project is based on encouraging sustainable development and maintaining the standing
forest, optimizing access to non-timber forest products and the consumption of local inputs. In
case of wood extraction, the Sustainable Forest Management Plan will be required, in
encouraging the emission of certifications of good practices. One of the main objectives is to
reduce illegal deforestation and profit from this activity, offering alternatives for income and
extraction. The Yellow Ipê Grouped REDD Project has the following target and guideline:
● 12.2 “By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural
resources”
● SDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
Another of the main objectives of the REDD project is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
through the conservation of standing forest. Thus, its activity is already an action to combat
climate change and its effects. The targets and guidelines for this objective are:
● 13.2 “Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning”;
● 13.3 “Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on
climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning”;
● SDG 15: To protect, restore and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial
ecosystems, to manage forests sustainably, to combat desertification, to halt and
reverse land degradation, and to halt the loss of biodiversity.
The project is based on the conservation and restoration of forests in the Amazon biome,
ensuring forest services, preservation of natural resources and biodiversity. The targets and
guidelines related to this objective are:
● 15.1 “By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and
inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands,
mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements"";
● 15.2 “By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of
forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase
afforestation and reforestation globally”;

the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened
species”;
● 15.9 “By 2020, integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local
planning, development processes, poverty reduction strategies and accounts”;
● 15.a “Mobilize and significantly increase financial resources from all sources to conserve
and sustainably use biodiversity and ecosystems”;
● 15.c “Enhance global support for efforts to combat poaching and trafficking of protected
species, including by increasing the capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable
livelihood opportunities”.
Reducing deforestation and promoting sustainable development in the Amazon is also a key
component to Brazil’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement.
According to the Brazilian Government Ministry for the Environment (in Portuguese, Ministério
do Meio Ambiente), the implementation of REDD+ activities are an important component to meet
the Country’s contribution under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
while preserving natural forest resources50.
The following components of the Brazilian commitments under the Convention are reinforced by
the development of the Yellow Ipê Grouped REDD Project:
● Strengthening and enforcing the implementation of the Forest Code, at federal,
state and municipal levels;
● Strengthening policies and measures with a view to achieve, in the Brazilian
Amazon, zero illegal deforestation by 2030 and compensate for greenhouse gas
emissions from legal suppression of vegetation by 2030;
● Enhancing sustainable native forest management systems, through
georeferencing and tracking systems applicable to native forest management,
with a view to curb illegal and unsustainable practices.
In summary, the project plans to expand the extraction of NTFPs and other alternative income for
the community, encouraging handicrafts and local traditions. In addition, the project activities will
enable the creation of jobs to monitor the area, prioritizing the hiring of local residents for
monitoring of the area, with professional training. Income from the sale of credits will make it

The TATUY REDD+ project aims to avoid unplanned deforestation in an area of 22,724 hectares of Amazon
Forest in one of the areas with the highest deforestation pressure for the expansion of agricultural activities
in Brazil. The project is in the state of Mato Grosso, within the municipal boundaries of Porto dos Gaúchos
and Tabaporã.
The main project activities that generate GHG emission reductions are actions to increase Fire Monitoring
and Firefighting to prevent the loss of forest cover, as this is one of the first steps of deforestation and land
use change in the region. Surveillance and Environmental Awareness activities that will be carried out with
communities contribute to the achievement of the expected climate benefits.
Prior to project implementation, the scenario was insecure for forest integrity in the project area due to high
pressure from fires, illegal deforestation, and agricultural expansion. For this reason, a Forest Integrity Plan
will be implemented in the project area to increase the protection of the area.
The project communities had limited organization and commitment to address local social weaknesses, such
as few income-generating opportunities for women, poor community welfare conditions, among others. The
project's activities aim to broaden the communities' knowledge and provide them with the right tools so that
they can have more income options and better well-being conditions.
Local wildlife suffers from changes in land use with the loss of forest cover, species seek food, refuge, and
other elements for their survival in other areas, which become increasingly distant. For this reason, the
activities of the Wildlife Prevention Program and Environmental Awareness will be important for
preserving wildlife in the project region. This increases the risks associated with roads, such as being run
over. The main climate, community and biodiversity objectives of the project are to:
• Avoidance and prevention of unplanned deforestation of the tropical rainforest in the region,
thereby avoiding the emission of 1,220,922.52 tCO2e over a period of 30 years of the project
crediting period (annual average of 40,697.42 tCO2e);
• Protection and conservation of 22,724 ha of forest in the Amazon biome;
• Reduce the impact of fires on the region's forests;
• Improve the quality of life of the community by providing alternative sources of income;
• Reduce pressure on local wildlife due to habitat loss and roadkill.

2.2 Justification of the choice of the methodology and
why it is applicable to the project activity:
The chosen small scale methodology AMS-I.D (Version 14)
is applicable to the project activity (6 X 0.75 MW which
accounts to 4.5 MW) as it is a renewable energy project
activity with a maximum output capacity less than 15 MW.
The AMS-I.D (UNFCCC approved CDM) methodology is
applicable to the project as the project is a grid
connected wind power project that exports electricity to
TNEB and thus displaces the electricity supplied by at
least one fossil fuel fired power plant.
The below table clearly shows the applicability of AMS I.

protection forests in the South Sumatera province of Ogan Komering Ilir district.
The project area extends from 2.5 km to 15 km in width along a 46 km long coastline
extending from north to south. The east side faces the Bangka Strait and the west side is
adjacent to the other production forest concession project site across a waterway (see

This project area was certified as a protected forest by the Minister of Forestry in 1985
(see Figure 1-19). Although the land ownership of the protected forest remains with the
state, the management of the Lumpur River - Mesuji Basin Protected Forest was
transferred to the local government of OKI District in 1998 (see Figure 1-20, 1-21). In 2013,
TAP was granted a license by the OKI District Government to operate a 23,500 hectare
forest in part of the Lumpur River - Mesuji Watershed Protection Forest, and TAP now has
the right to implement forest conservation projects. We will disclose the business license
as evidence on request.
The project site is located far from the provincial capital and the state capital, and is limited
to transportation by boat due to the lack of roads, and is located in a place with poor
access, 5 ~ 6 hours from the provincial capital.

2.1 Project Goals, Design and Long-Term Viability
2.1.1 Summary Description of the Project (G1.2)
The REDD+ group project Conservation of the Oak Ecological Corridor Guantiva – La Rusia – Iguaque in
Colombia, comprises the departments of Boyacá, Santander and Cundinamarca. The first instance is
located in the municipalities of Coromoro, Encino, Charalá, Onzaga, Mogotes and Gámbita, in Santander
Department.
The project zone supports a large Oak corridor, where the conditions created by the topography allow the
presence of variety of ecosystems and represent the essential wildlife habitat for many species. The
heterogeneity of these forests has led to a high richness and diversity of fauna and flora. In the region,
inhabit endemic and/or endangered species, which makes this region one of the most diverse of the
Colombian Andes.
However, these areas have been affected by livestock and agricultural activities, represented by dual-
purpose cattle (milk and meat), cultivation of coffee and sugar cane (panela) and production of fique
fibers. These activities are characterized by traditional, low-tech products and low value-added products.
Based on prevailing historical land use trends in the region, agricultural and livestock uses are the
scenarios identified prior the implementation of the activities (baseline scenario).
In this regard, the main project objective is the reduction of illegal logging and the recovery of degraded
forests through the development of the following activities: implementation of conservation-production
agreements (agroforestry and reforestation activities), support to municipalities in the process of land use
planning and establishment of civil reserves and other private conservation tools to reduce the agricultural
expansion. The project participants and beneficiaries are the farmers voluntarily involve in the project with
legal land tenure and conservation-production agreement signed between Fundación Natura and them.
These activities will (i) promote sustainable economic activities that positively impact the local community
while reducing the impact of production on forests, (ii) integrate land management into the socioeconomic
and political climate, and (iii) fortify management, governance, and technical capacities to ensure the
efficient implementation of the REDD+ project.

CCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3
The project’s climate objectives are to mitigate climate change through the implementation of activities
that allow the reduction of deforestation and forest degradation in oak’s forest (Quercus humboldtii and
Colombobalanus excelsa).
The project’s community objectives take into account the strengthening of the economic activities carried
out by the rural families, through economic support, training and technical workshops. These activities will
enhance the local administrative capacity, leadership capacity and environmental awareness.
The project’s biodiversity objectives focus on preserving endangered species and their habitats as
compared to baseline scenario conditions through forest protection.
The reference region covers 67 municipalities of which 38 belong to Boyacá, 26 to Santander and three
to Cundinamarca, delimited by the coordinates: Min. X, Y 611,820,000; 553,680,000 and Max. X, Y
830,520,000; 77,820,000. Currently, the grouped project has only one instance (instance I) and it
corresponds to the forest area of private landowners, who have been voluntarily involved in the project
with legal land tenure and conservation-production agreement signed between Fundación Natura and
them. The total area of the project for the first instance is 53.37 hectares. The project participants
Information is included in the Sections 2.1.3 and 2.1.4.
Total avoided emissions due to the project implementation reach 3,306 tCO2e. The annual average GHG
emissions reduction is 110.20 tCO2e across the project crediting period, including buffer (RF), leakage
(DLF) and project efficiency (EI) reductions.
Climate objectives: The project’s climate objectives include climate change mitigation through the
implementation of activities that reduce deforestation and degradation of the oak (Quercus humboldtii and
Colombobalanus excelsa) forests of the Guantiva – La Rusia – Iguaque corridor. The project area is
located in the western slope of the Eastern Cordillera, in the jurisdiction of the departments of Santander,
Boyacá and Cundinamarca (Colombia). It is expected to reduce GHG emissions and increase carbon
stocks over time through the following activities: reducing illegal logging; restoring degraded forests
through the implementation of conservation-production agreements with stakeholders; development of
sustainable productive activities; improving the connectivity of small forest relicts that can be found in the
most fragmented areas of the country through restoration projects; and improving the management
capacity in the reduction of agricultural expansion14.
Community objectives: The project’s social objectives aim to strengthen rural livelihood economic
activities, as defined by the Basic Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF):
- Strengthening local governance through improvements in the planning and implementation of
land-use management practices.
- Assistance in the development of alternative productive activities through training and technical
assistance in agroforestry and silvopastoral systems and their respective value chains.
- Strengthen local management, leadership capacity and environmental awareness through
training activities for people of the community, with emphasis on women’s participation.
- Contribution of resources to the community associated with the implementation of the project.
- Strengthen social capital through the strengthening of existing institutions, such as corporations,
associations and cooperatives.
14 At present, the factors that are causing greater alteration and degradation to oak forests are the opening of the
agricultural frontier and the local community demand cover for wood and firewood (ranging from 5 to 8 t / year).
However, commercial logging, which is possible within the framework of resolution 096 of 2006, could also become a
degradation factor for these forests if it is not carried out with sustainability criteria, as indicated in the same
resolution.

The project activity is a Greenfield project for generation of electrical energy using wind which is a
renewable source of energy. Thus, this project actually displaces the electricity grid which is
essentially fossil-fuel based.
In wind energy generation, kinetic energy of the wind is converted into mechanical energy and
subsequently into electrical energy. Wind turbines capture the wind's energy with three propeller-
like blades, which are mounted on a rotor, to generate electricity. The turbines sit high atop towers,
taking advantage of the stronger and less turbulent wind. As the wind blows through the blades of
the windmill, a pocket of low-pressure air forms on the downwind side of the blade. The low-
pressure air pocket then pulls the blade towards it, causing the rotor to spin. The rotor turns the
shaft that further spins the connected generator. The spinning of this generator produces the
required electricity. Since power is generated from wind energy, no emissions are attributed to the
project emissions and emissions due to fossil-fuel based grid has been displaced due to the project
activity. Detailed information of gases & emission sources in baseline & project activity have
discussed in Section B.3 of this document.
Emission reductions will be claimed on the net electrical energy that is supplied to grid. Details of
monitoring of emission reductions and their calculation have been provided in Section B.6.3 &
Section B.7.3 of this document.

provide a measure of the actual electrical energy that would have been sourced from a fossil-fuel
based grid had it not been generated using wind energy. Hence, the fossil-fuel power based grid
shall form the baseline to the project activity which has been developed in Section B.4 of this

716,project_description,"1.1 Summary Description of the Project (G3)
The goal of the project is to protect the property as a carbon sink, maintain the biodiversity values
of the property, and provide net positive community benefits through support for the local high
school scholarship fund. The climate objective is to avoid emissions from deforestation during the
project timeframe. The project area was slated for conversion to sugarcane agriculture.
The project consists of protection of the property through 2040 (30 years) through patrols. Gallon
Jug Agroindustry Ltd. (GJA) owned and managed the property prior to implementation of the
project. Gallon Jug Agroindustries implemented the project, and then sold the property to The
Forestland Group (TFG). Forest Carbon Offsets LLC (FCO) was an agent of GJA to develop the
carbon finance project, and continues to serve in that capacity for TFG. The Conservation
Management Institute at Virginia Tech (CMI) was the subcontractor originally hired to conduct
technical analyses on behalf of FCO in 2011. A more recent update to the inventory data plus
additional community input data was developed by ERA/Offsetters/NatureBank of Vancouver,
Canada. CMI updated remote sensing and mapping data in 2015.
This project started in 2011 to protect 8,432 ha of tropical forests in Belize, Central America. The
entire property owned by GJA originally consisted of 53,882 ha. Near the center of the property,
1,214 ha is managed as a cattle and coffee farm. An exceptional ecotourism lodge (Chan Chich
Lodge) is on the property as well. The property was selectively logged multiple times through the
1960’s when it was purchased (fee simple) in the 1980’s by Sir Barry Bowen, a well-known
businessman and former Belizean Senator. The property was managed for conservation with the
exception of the farm. Due to the untimely death of the owner and the global economic recession,
a portion of the property was proposed for development and conversion to sugarcane for a new
sugar/electricity facility. Expected carbon finance allowed the owners to avoid going forward with
the sugarcane project, and instead sell a large portion of the property (~41,152 ha) including the
entire project area, to The Forestland Group, LLC of Chapel Hill, NC.
Biodiversity at Gallon Jug is well documented and world-renowned. The densest population of
large cats in Central America has been documented on the property primarily due to superb habitat
and a rigorous prohibition on hunting. In addition to large cats, there are notable populations of
Baird’s Tapir (Tapirus bairdii), Yucatan Black Howler Monkeys (Alouatta pigra), and Geoffroy’s
Spider Monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) all of which are listed as endangered by the International Union
for the Conservation of Nature. Many other rare species are commonly found at the project site and
24 species are listed by IUCN above “least concern”. The property has been identified as a key
biodiversity area (KBA) in Belize and Central America (Meerman 2007) and is contiguous with two
other protected areas, the Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area, and the Maya
Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala. The project proponents will support the community through
contributions to the Gallon Jug-Chan Chich High School Scholarship Fund, a scholarship fund to
defray the cost of high school tuition for children in the community.
The “without project” baseline scenario for this project is conversion to agricultural for sugarcane.
Additionality is proven by virtue of the financial statements of the former owner and written plans
for conversion. Road access is adequate. Topography is minimal. Soils are good as evidenced
by the existing cattle operation already on the property and past efforts to evaluate sugarcane.
Impacts to biodiversity and the local community would be drastic, largely negative and potentially
impact the surrounding properties.
The “with project” scenario would maintain the current management regime which consists of very
low impact timber harvesting and conservation of the property. FSC certification will be achieved

in 2016. The hunting prohibition will be maintained and patrols increased. Support for the
community will be maintained and increased by virtue of contributions to a scholarship program for
members of the community to attend high school. Climate, biodiversity and community value
monitoring would commence.
Climate, Community, and Biodiversity Standard Gold Level is achieved by virtue of the significant
biodiversity resources conserved on the property including habitat for multiple IUCN listed species
and most notably IUCN-Endangered Baird’s tapir (Tapirus bairdii), Yucatan black howler monkey
(Alouatta pigra) and Geoffroy’s spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi).
Forest Carbon Offsets LLC (FCO) is the project developer. The Forestland Group LLC is the project
proponent. The Project follows the carbon accounting principles of conservatism, accuracy,
completeness, transparency, consistency, and relevance. Validation under the Verified Carbon

Accordingly, in chapter 1.3 of eligibility, the wetlands are excluded from the eligible area.
b) Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10% of the area in each
of the following types of land when these lands are included within the project boundary:
(i) Land containing organic soils.
The soils of the project area consist predominantly of sandy loam over sandy clay loam and belong to
three well-described soil series. Among the encountered soil series, no organic soils are present within
the project boundary (Asiamah, et al., 2007)
(ii) The land which, in the baseline, is subject to land-use and management practices and receives
inputs listed in appendices 1 and 2 to this methodology.
The baseline before the project start date was grasslands without any inputs, as described in section
3.4.

Several tools were also applied to the project. The applicability conditions of these tools were met and
are described below.
The applicability conditions of the combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate
additionality in A/R CDM project activities (Version 01) are as follows:
a) Forestation of the land within the proposed project boundary performed with or without being
registered as the A/R CDM project activity shall not lead to violation of any applicable law even if the law
is not enforced.
The project activities will not lead to the violation of any applicable law.
b) This tool is not applicable to small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities.
The project is not classified as small-scale.
The tool used for estimation of carbon stocks and change in the carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in
A/R CDM project activities (Version 04.2) has no internal applicability conditions.
The applicability conditions for the tool for estimation of the change in soil organic carbon stocks due to
the implementation of A/R CDM project activities (Version 01.1.0) has the following applicability
conditions:
(a) The areas of land to which this tool is applied:

suggested by (Gumbricht, 2017)40 was used to find that 20 hectares described as ‘marshes’ overlap with
the eligible area. This area was discounted from the geographic supports and all estimations.
(ii) Do not contain organic soils as defined in Annex A: Glossary of the IPCC GPG LULUCF 2003;
No organic soils are present within the project boundary. The soils of the project area consist
predominantly of sandy loam over sandy clay loam and belong to three well-described soil series
(Asiamah, et al., 2007).
(iii) Are not subject to any of the land management practices and application of inputs as listed in the
Tables 1 and 2;
The area of land on which this tool has been applied is not subject to any of the cropland or grassland
management practices listed in Table 1 and 2. The baseline before the project start date was grasslands
without any inputs.
(b) The A/R CDM project activity meets the following conditions:
(i) Litter remains on site and is not removed in the A/R CDM project activity; and
Since project is made of different compartments, of different species and ages, there will be always litter
on site.
(ii) Soil disturbance attributable to the A/R CDM project activity, if any, is:
In accordance with appropriate soil conservation practices and limited to soil disturbance for site
preparation before planting. Such disturbance is not repeated in less than twenty years. All land

preparation involves appropriate soil preparation and soil testing and analysis. This ensures optimization
of the site as soil preparation, to a large extent, determines the success of the planting.

and Revegetation (ARR). Eligible ARR activities are those that increase carbon sequestration
and/or reduce GHG emissions by establishing, increasing, or restoring vegetative cover (forest or
non-forest). Project activities comprise the planting, sowing, or human-assisted natural
regeneration of woody vegetation. Thus, the project increases carbon sequestration by restoring
vegetative cover through planting.

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
Project meets the applicability criteria defined by the selected methodology, which is AMS-I.D, ver
18.0:
• The project activity is a greenfield, grid connected renewable electricity generation project.
• The project activity is the installation of hydro power plant.
• The project does not involve capacity addition, a retrofit of (an) existing plant(s) or a
replacement of (an) existing plant(s).
• The project does not involve combined heat and power generation activity.
• The geographic and system boundaries for the relevant electricity grid can be clearly
identified and information on the characteristics of the grid is available.
Since there exists no delineation of project electricity system or connected electricity systems by
DNA, following criteria has been used to determine the existence of significant transmission
constraints:
• In case of electricity systems with spot markets for electricity: there are differences in
electricity prices (without transmission and distribution costs) of more than 5 percent
between the systems during 60 percent or more of the hours of the year.
• The transmission line is operated at 90% or more of its rated capacity during 90% percent
or more of the hours of the year.
Since the project output is fed to the Turkish electricity grid which does not involve any distinct
electricity systems that applies different price, first criteria defined above is not applicable. Also,
since the transmission line between the proposed projects and nearest substation is built within
the scope of the project and there exist no information on grid capacity utilization, second criteria
is also inapplicable. Based on assessment above, it is difficult to conclude with a significant
transmission constraint or grid boundary. Since there is no dispatch grid system in Turkey, the
project boundary is considered as the National Electricity Grid of Turkey according to applied tool.
The geographical and physical boundaries of the Turkish grid and location of the power plants are
well identified as given diagram below.

The project area of 1,273 ha is located within the larger VCR property, in Region XIV, Chile, south of the city of
Valdivia. (At the time of TNC’s acquisition of the property in 2003, the property was part of Region X, which
was subsequently subdivided by the Chile government forming a new administrative Region XIV, which now
contains the VCR). The project area was delineated, consulting engineering plans and permits, to align with
areas designated for construction of the coastal highway and for “substitution” of native forest with plantations
(detailed in Section 3 below).

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: VCS Version 3.1
“The project area shall meet an internationally accepted definition of forest, such as those
based on UNFCCC host-country thresholds or FAO definitions, and shall qualify as forest for a
minimum of 10 years before the project start date.”
Assessment of the project area at the time of project start was made applying classified Landsat
imagery13 mosaicked for the years 2002 and 2003 (to achieve sufficient cloud-free coverage; the 2002
image (Enhanced thematic mapper+ February 1 2002) of the classification area (path/row 233/88) was
98.2% cloud free, the 2003 image (Enhanced thematic mapper+ February 20 2003) of the
classification area (path/row 233/88) was 99.7% cloud free).
Forested conditions at the time of project start are demonstrated in Figures 1.3 and 1.4.
13 For the satellite imagery classification, a Minimum Mapping Unit of 0.81 ha (3 pixels * 3 pixels) was used,
approximating the minimum area of forest of 0.5 ha as defined by the Chile Designated National Authority
(DNA) under the CDM, Comisión Nacional del Medio Ambiente (CONAMA).

Note that all non-forest areas identified within the road clearance corridor and permitted forest
substitution “rodales” were excluded from the eligible project area (Figure 1.4).
Compliance with VCS AFOLU Requirement 4.2.5 is further demonstrated by superimposing the project
area on 1993 aerial photography (Figures 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8). All Eucalyptus plantations in the road
clearance corridor that were planted less than 10 years prior to the project start date (i.e. planted after
1993) were excluded from the project area, conforming with the VCS limitation on secondary forests,
that they must be “...at least 10 years old ... at the start of the project” (VCS AFOLU 4.2.5).

According to the Simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale clean development mechanism project
activities (decision 4/CMP.1, Annex II) publicized by UNFCCC, the project type and category are defined as
follows:
Type - I Renewable Energy Projects, and
Category I-C - Thermal energy production with or without electricity
Technology of the small-scale project activity
The proposed project is to install 50,000 parabolic type solar thermal cookers for rural households in Xichuan
county, replacing the coal used previously for cooking and water boiling. This will lead to the reduction of coal
consumption and consequently the reduction of CO emission. 2
According to the conservative principle, the calculated maximum power of single solar cooker is 873.964 W 2. th
Therefore, the maximum total installed capacity of the project is no more than 43.6982 MW th
(873.964×50,000×10-6), below the 45 MW limit of small-scale CDM project. th
The choice of solar cookers parameters is based on National Standard of P.R. China (GB) for solar cookers
(NY/T219-2003), but the national standard only has the minimum requirements which cannot reflect the true
2 876.512 W is calculated based on Chinese National Standard (GB: NY/T219-2003) and the Testing Report (NO. th
NY2011J1858) issued by the Nanyang Quality and Technical Supervision, Inspection and Testing Center. The calculation is
as below:

switching from coal or petroleum fuel to natural gas” (version 4.0.0) is applied. In the following the
applicability criteria are provided and it is explained how each of it is met (this is equal as for the eligibility
criteria and the same references are used):
EC-01: This methodology is applicable to project activities that switch in one or several element
processes from coal or petroleum fuel to natural gas. The fuel switching is undertaken in
processes for heat generation that are located at and directly linked to an industrial process with
a main output other than heat or that provide heat to a district heating system by means of heat-
only boilers.
EC-02: Prior to the implementation of the project activity, only coal or petroleum fuel (but not
natural gas) have been used in the element processes.
EC-03: Regulations/programs do not constrain the facility from using the fossil fuels being used
prior to fuel switching.

1. “This category comprises renewable energy generation units, such as
photovoltaics, hydro, tidal/wave, wind, geothermal and renewable biomass, that
supply electricity to and/or displace electricity from an electricity distribution system
that is or would have been supplied by at least one fossil fuel fired generating unit.”
The project activity involves the setting up of wind farms, i.e., renewable generating
units of cumulative generation capacity 7.5 MW to harness a renewable source of
energy (wind power potential) and export the generated electricity to the fossil fuel
dominated electricity generation and distribution system, i.e. the Southern Regional
Electricity Grid of India9. In the process, an equivalent quantum of electricity that
would have been generated by the grid in line with the grid electricity generation mix
is displaced by the project activity. The carbon intensity of the fossil-fuel dominated
generation mix of the grid is evident from the following break-up of various types of
energy sources constituting the grid-mix contributing electricity to the Southern Grid
system.
Table 7: Power Generation mix of southern regional grid of India
Sourc : Central Electricity authority10 as on 31/01/2009
*From Wind Energy Sources as on 30/09/200811
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
2. “If the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a
wind/diesel unit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small-scale CDM project activity
applies only to the renewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel, the
capacity of the entire unit shall not exceed the limit of 15MW”.
The project activity involves only wind power generation. The gross wind power
generation capacity of the bundled project activity is 7.5 MW, which is less than 15
MW, as stipulated in the applicability criterion under consideration.
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
3. “Combined heat and power (co-generation) systems are not eligible under
this category”
The project activity involves generation of electricity only through WTGs and is not a
co-generation system.

VCS Project Description
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
4. “In the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy
generation units at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added
capacity of the units added by the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be
physically distinct from the existing units.”
The project activity does not involve the addition of renewable energy generation
units at an existing renewable power generation facility.
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
5. “Project activities that seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for
renewable energy generation are included in this category. To qualify as a small
scale project, the total output of the modified or retrofitted unit shall not exceed the
limit of 15 MW”
The renewable energy generating wind-farms employed by the project activity are
newly constructed set up and does not involve retrofitting or modification of any
existing facility for renewable energy generation.
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
Thus, the project activity fulfills all the applicability criteria of the simplified small scale

B.4. Description of baseline and its development:
The proposed project activity qualifies to use the simplified methodology for small scale projects total
capacity of the project is 6.5 MW which is less than the 15 MW (upper limit) as per the CDM guideline
for a small scale project and this position will remain unchanged during the crediting period.
As per the guidance provided in AMS I.D. Version 13 (point 9) for this project “the baseline is the kWh
produced by the renewable generating unit multiplied by an emission coefficient (measured in kg
CO2e/kWh) calculated in a transparent and conservative manner” as:
(a) A combined margin (CM), consisting of the combination of operating margin (OM) and build margin
(BM) according to the procedures prescribed in the ‘Tool to calculate the emission factor for an
electricity system(Version 01.1)’.
OR
(b) The weighted average emissions (in kg CO2e/kWh) of the current generation mix. The data of the
year in which project generation occurs must be used.
Here we used the method (a) for baseline determination. Since the project will sell entire energy
generated to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) grid, the relevant electric power system for the purpose
of calculating the CM is the CEB grid.
Calculation of OM emissions factor
As per Annex 12, EB 35 Report “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system
(Version 01.1)” (now referred as “Grid Tool”) the OM emissions factor can be calculated in one of
four ways:

a) Simple OM
b) Simple adjusted OM
c) Dispatch data analysis OM
d) Average OM
The table B.4 below shows data on the generation by the CEB for the latest five years for which data are
available (2003 to 2007) by low cost/must run resources (hydro and wind) and total grid generation (the
additional plants all being thermal plants).

Since the total percentage of low cost/must run generation is less than 50% it is possible to use the
Simple OM method to calculated the operating margin, as specified in Grid Tool. Option B is used to
calculate the Simple OM. The relevant formula as given in the Grid Tool is
Where:
EF = Simple operating margin CO emission factor in year y (tCO /MWh) grid,OMsimple,y 2 2
EG = Net quantity of electricity generated and delivered to the grid by power unit m in year y (MWh) m,y
EF = CO emission factor of power unit m in year y (tCO /MWh) EL,m,y 2 2
13

PROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-PDD) - Version 03
CDM – Executive Board
m = All power units serving the grid in year y except low-cost / must-run power units
y = the three most recent years for which data is available at the time of submission of the CDM-PDD to
the DOE for validation (ex ante option)
We used the ex ante approach to calculate the Simple OM, namely, “A 3 year generation weighted
average, based on the most recent data available at the time of submission of the CDM-PDD to the DOE
for validation” The latest generation statistics available from the CEB at this time was for the calendar
year 2007. We have therefore used data for the three years 2005, 2006 and 2007 to calculate the OM.
Calculation of BM emissions factor
As per the Grid Tool all plants (including hydro), other than plants which have been registered as CDM
activities, must be considered for calculating the build margin (BM). Equation 12 of the Grid tool for
calculating the BM is taken for this project.
Where:
EF = Build margin CO emission factor in year y (tCO /MWh) grid,BM,y 2 2
EG = Net quantity of electricity generated and delivered to the grid by power unit m in year y (MWh) m,y
EF = CO emission factor of power unit m in year y (tCO /MWh) EL,m,y 2 2
m = All power units included in Build Margin calculation
y = Most recent historical year for which power generation data is available (2007)
As for the OM the most recent generation information available is for the year 2007. We therefore use
this information to calculate the BM. The data sources used in the calculation are also the same as for
calculation of the OM.
Calculation of the CM emissions factor
As per equation 13 of the Grid Tool the combined margin (CM) emissions factor is calculated as follows:
14

PROJECT DESIGN DOCUMENT FORM (CDM-SSC-PDD) - Version 03
CDM – Executive Board
Where:
EF = Build margin CO emission factor in year y (tCO /MWh) grid,BM,y 2 2
EF = Operating margin CO emission factor in year y (tCO /MWh) grid,OM,y 2 2
w = Weighting of operating margin emissions factor (%) OM
w = Weighting of build margin emissions factor (%) BM
As per the Grid Tool, a default value of 0.5 for the weighting factors is used to average the OM and the
BM emissions factors for the first crediting period.
Calculation of the Baseline
As per the Grid Tool, the baseline (in tCO ) is the MWh produced by the project multiplied by the 2
Combined Margin expressed in tCO /MWh. 2
Leakage
As specified in paragraph 12 of AMS I.D./Version 13, leakage is to be considered when generating
equipment is transferred from another activity or when existing equipment is transferred to another
activity. In the Project, neither of these situations applies, and therefore no leakage source needs to be
considered for this project. The generating equipment is new, and there is no existing equipment that
could be transferred to another activity.",1879,1879_apspl_pdd_30_03_2010.pdf,sector,{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'},"What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?",{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}

2.2 Applicability of Methodology
ACM0006 is applicable to project activities that operate biomass (co-)fired power-and-heat plants.
The CDM project activity may include the following activities or, where applicable, combinations
of these activities:
 The installation of new plants at a site where currently no power and heat generation
occurs (Greenfield projects);
 The installation of new plants at a site where currently power or heat generation occurs.
The new plant replaces or is operated next to existing plants (capacity expansion projects);
 The improvement of energy efficiency of existing plants (energy efficiency improvement
projects), which can also lead to a capacity expansion, e.g. by retrofitting the existing plant;
 The total or partial replacement of fossil fuels by biomass in existing plants or in new plants
that would have been built in the absence of the project (fuel switch projects), e.g. by
increasing the share of biomass use as compared to the baseline, by retrofitting an existing
plant to use biomass, etc.
The proposed project is a greenfield project and consists of the installation of a utility for
electricity and heat generation purposes. Then, it does not involve retrofitting, capacity expansion
nor replacement of fossil fuels.
ACM0006 is also applicable under the following conditions:

VCS Project Description
For the bundled project activity, the project start date is the earliest date of the
commissioning of any wind mill. As per the table above, the earliest commissioning
date is for the wind mill located at location no. B-002, B-003, B-004 and B-005 which
is 09/01/2008.
Therefore the start date for this bundled project is 09/01/2008.
Crediting period start date: 09/01/2008
The Crediting period start date is 28th March 2006, as per section 5.2.1 of VCS
2007.1 but in the bundle the earliest commission machine was commissioned on
09/01/2008 which is after 28th March 2006. Therefore the Crediting period start date
is the same as start date of the bundled project activity. So the Crediting period start
date for this bundled project is 09/01/2008.

The project is located in Central and Muchinga provinces of Zambia and stretches across
sixteen chiefdoms as shown in Table 4 and Figure 2 below. These sixteen chiefdoms4
constitute the geographic boundary for the reference region and the project activity instances
are located within. The project area for the SALM component consists of agricultural lands only.
For the REDD+ component it consists of numerous parcels of forested lands found within the
chiefdoms.
For the SALM component, all farms participating in the project have one set of coordinates
taken using GPS to show their locations. The GPS coordinate points for the SALM component of
this project activity instances are available as separate KML files.
The REDD+ and SALM project activity takes place at 9°40’ to 14°10’ South and 29°50’ to
33°40’ East (see the map in Figure 2). The geographic boundaries for the REDD+ and SALM
project activity instances are provided as separate KML files.

818,methodology,"2.2 Justification of the choice of the methodology and why
it is applicable to the project activity:
The methodology applied is Category AMS-I.E: Switch from Non–Renewable
Biomass for Thermal Applications by the User – Version 01 from February 01
of 2008 onwards which is applicable for project activities that avoid
greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable biomass in order to generate
thermal energy.
This category comprises small thermal appliances that displace the use of
non-renewable biomass by introducing new renewable energy end-user
technologies. The end-user technology in the case of this project can be
established as the project proponent, who utilizes the thermal energy
generated by the new renewable energy technology.
There are no similar registered small-scale CDM project activities in the
region of Nazaré da Mata, once Social Carbon Company made a research and did
not find any registered small–scale CDM Project activity in the region. The
sources of registered small-scale CDM project activity consulted were the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 21 and
Brazilian’s Technology and Science Ministry 22 . Therefore, the proposed
project activity is not saving the non-renewable biomass accounted by the
other registered project activities.
The utilization of firewood from areas without any kind of management can
not be considered a renewable source of biomass, since it involves a
decrease of carbon pools and increases the carbon emissions to the
atmosphere. Moreover, the native wood provided from areas without a
reforestation management plan does not fit any of the options of UNFCCC
definition of renewable biomass in Annex 18, EB 23.
Furthermore, firewood has been used for many decades as fuel in Brazil23.
Although it is impossible to define a start date on which this kind of non-
renewable biomass began to be applied, there are many documents to prove
that wood has been used for thermal energy generation before 1989 as
requested in the applied methodology. Firewood used to be the most employed
source of primary energy until de decade of 1970, when the petroleum started

Maguary Ceramic - VCS Project Description
to supply the majority of Brazilian’s energy needs 24 . Moreover the
Brazilian’s Energy and Mine Ministry has been monitoring every energetic
sectors of Brazil since 1970, and firewood appears over the years monitored
as a significant source of thermal energy for ceramic sector.25 Especially in
the ceramic sector, the use of firewood is visible non-renewable and
unsustainable, involving negative environmental impacts associated.26
This way, it can be concluded that non-renewable biomass has been used since
31st December 1989.
The biomasses utilized in the project: Algaroba wood, native wood with
sustainable management plan, sugar cane briquette, wood residues from
constructions and industries, and sawdust are common in the region
generated.
The possible biomasses that could be utilized in the project: Eucalyptus
wood, cashew tree pruning, glycerin, elephant grass, and coconut husk are
also common in the region generated.
The Algaroba wood is considered renewable according to option IV, as soon as
it fits the following assumption:
“The biomass is a biomass residue and the use of that biomass residue in the
project activity does not involve a decrease of carbon pools, in particular
dead wood, litter or soil organic carbon, on the land areas where the
biomass residues are originating from.”
The utilization of Algaroba (Prosopis juliflora) is in according with option
IV since it is considered a biomass residue due its competitive
characteristics. A research made by EMBRAPA27, which encompass the States of
Pernambuco and Bahia, affirmed that Algaroba is characterized as an invasive
exotic plant due to its fast expansion, which causes many environmental
impacts28. This source stated that there were several centers of Algaroba
operation highlighting the San Francisco Basin, which is comprised for many
municipalities from the states of Bahia and Pernambuco, including this
project region.
Furthermore, Algaroba is a very aggressive plant, and is able to invade
natural habitats and to inhibit the regeneration of Caatinga species, thus
reducing biodiversity of the biome. Although this tree has good properties
to the Caatinga population, like production of fodder, flour, and human
feed, Algaroba is very widespread through the region and its control is
necessary to halt its dominance, and consequently, the pruning and cut of
this tree is largely done throughout the Caatinga‘s biome29.

Maguary Ceramic - VCS Project Description
The native wood with sustainable forest management plan is considered
renewable according to option I, as soon as it fits all the assumptions
below:
“The biomass is originating from land areas that are forests where:
(a) The land area remains a forest; and
(b) Sustainable management practices are undertaken on these land areas to
ensure, in particular, that the level of carbon stocks on these land areas
does not systematically decrease over time (carbon stocks may temporarily
decrease due to harvesting); and
(c) Any national or regional forestry and nature conservation regulations
are complied with.”
The native wood with sustainable forest management plan fits all the three
options above since the area remains a forest due to sustainable management
practices that are undertaken with.
The sustainable forest management plan can be organized into three stages:
firstly, the division of the property in exploitable areas and areas of
permanent preservation that are inaccessible to exploitation. The second
stage is the planning of roads that connect the area with the primary roads.
In the third stage, the allocated area is divided for exploration in blocks
in order to sustain forest exploitation annually30.
Furthermore, the minimum requirements of the management plan are defined by
Article 19 of Brazilian Forest Code, and are regulated by Decree 5975/0631.
Sugar cane briquette, wood residues from constructions and industries, and
sawdust are industries residues coming from large scale reforestation or
agro industrial projects, so it is considered renewable according to option
V of methodology definition of renewable biomass:
“The biomass is the non-fossil fraction of an industrial or municipal
waste”.
Sugar cane bagasse is generated by industries to produce sugar and alcohol,
and is compacted into briquettes in order to generate thermal energy. The
wood residues from constructions and industries are resulted from
construction and industries residues, which constitute a huge problem due to
the deficiency of a correct destination for this wood. The sawdust is
generated in the production of wood, which is utilized in several segments
of industries and activities.
The Eucalyptus wood is considered renewable according to option I, as soon
as it fits all the assumptions below:
“The biomass is originating from land areas that are forests where:
(a) The land area remains a forest; and
(b) Sustainable management practices are undertaken on these land areas to
ensure, in particular, that the level of carbon stocks on these land areas
does not systematically decrease over time (carbon stocks may temporarily
decrease due to harvesting); and
(c) Any national or regional forestry and nature conservation regulations
are complied with.”
The Eucalyptus wood fits all the three options above since just wood from
Eucalyptus plantation areas are utilized, i.e. the area remains a Eucalyptus

VCS Project Description Template
In accordance with Appendix B of the simplified modalities and procedures for small-
scale CDM project activities, the project is categorized as Type – I.D.: Version 13,
Scope 1, “Grid Connected renewable electricity generation”. Category ID is applicable
to projects that use renewable energy technologies which supply electricity to a grid.
The proposed project activity leads to reduction in the emission of GHG due to the
switching of fuel for power generation (substitution of grid power which is primarily
generated in coal based power plant with power generated in wind turbines using
renewable energy of wind).
The applicability criteria of the above methodology in the context of the proposed
project are as follows:
1. This category comprises renewable energy generation units, such as photovoltaics,
hydro, tidal/wave, wind, geothermal and renewable biomass, that supply electricity
to and displace electricity from an electricity distribution system that is or would
have been supplied by at least one fossil fuel fired generating unit.
The proposed project is supplementing the power needs of the Southern grid with
clean wind power which otherwise is fed by fossil fuel based power plants. Thus, the
proposed project displaces 15 MW of electricity by renewable means (through wind
power) that would otherwise have been generated from fossil fuel sources.
2. If the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g.. a
wind/diesel unit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small-scale CDM project
activity applies only to the renewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil
fuel, the capacity of the entire unit shall not exceed the limit of 15MW.
The proposed project falls under this eligibility limit of 15 MW as the electricity
generation potential of the proposed project is 15 MW of wind power.
Further, the renewable electricity generation capacity of the proposed project is 15
MW, which is equal to the qualifying capacity of 15 MW. The proposed project
activity will continue to generate power from the 20 WEGs at the total installed
capacity of 15 MW during each year of the crediting period.
As is therefore evident, the proposed project meets all the applicability criteria set out
under the selected small scale methodology according to CDM baseline and
monitoring methodologies and hence the project category is applicable to the project.",619,619_final_2009-09-17_vcs_pd__15_mw__2_sep_a.pdf,sector,{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'},"What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?",{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}

CCBVersion3,VCSVersion3
-The project provided job opportunities for local residents; all residents have been given an equal
opportunity to participate in the project if they meet the job requirements. Women and vulnerable people
who come from the poorest local households were not only provided with equal opportunities but also
consciously ensured that they can be part of the project. During the project implementation, about 3,523
local residents participated in the project such as fence building and reseeding, of which 1,814 are
women, and about 286 local herders were employed as grassland guardians to manage and protect the
grassland. All the employees that were involved in grass seeding and fence building were paid 150
RMB/day. Grassland guardians were paid around 24,000 RMB/year. These measures could improve the
incomeandreducepovertyoflocalresidents.
- The purpose of the project is to restore the degraded grassland ecosystem by seeding grass and
building fences to manage grazing which will generate GHG emission removals by increasing soil
organics or avoiding soil degradation, mitigate the impact of climate change on the local ecological
environment.
- The project can improve the quality and quantity of the grassland vegetation and provide more habitat

2.2 Applicability of Methodology
The methodology AMS-III.R comprises recovery and destruction of methane from manure and
wastes from household agricultural activities that would be decayed anaerobically emitting
methane to the atmosphere in the absence of the project activity. This project is belongs to the (b)
of 1st applicability criteria of AMS III.R because the management practice of a biogenic waste or
raw material was changed from deep pit storage to biogas digesters. The methodology AMS-I.C
comprises renewable energy technologies that supply individual households with thermal energy
that displaces fossil fuels.
The proposed project activity will change the existing swine manure treatment at the household
level from deep pits to household biogas digesters. The biogas digesters provide biogas for
cooking and other heating needs for households, replacing the fossil fuel coal. The project will
reduce CH4 emission from the slurry stored in a deep pit, and reduce CO2 emission from burn of
coal.
Therefore, this project can satisfy the applicable conditions of the methodologies AMS-III.R
(version 03) and AMS-I.C (version 19) as follows in Table B1 and Table B2.

In accordance with the provisions of AMS-I.D, the following tools were used.
“Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system” (Version 04/EB 75 Annex 15)
As the project emission is zero, emission reductions are equivalent to the emissions avoided in
the baseline scenario. The baseline is calculated on the net electricity exported to the grid and the
grid emission factor. The avoided emissions can be measured directly by the quantum of
electricity exported and imported is monitored by electricity meters at the generation site and at
the point of connection to the grid.

896,sector,"B.2 Project category applicable to the small-scale project activity:
Category I.C – Thermal energy for the user.
1. This category comprises renewable energy technologies that supply individual households or
users with thermal energy that displaces fossil fuels.
The project displaces fuel oil burned in a dolomite kiln with renewable biomass– charcoal fines.
2. Where generation capacity is specified by the manufacturer, it shall be less than 15 MW.
The kiln was built for a nominal capacity of burning 27 t / day of fuel oil.
The fuel oil used in the kiln has a LHV of 40,151 MJ/t (Balanço Energético Nacional, 2004) and,
therefore, the kiln’s equivalent thermal capacity is 12.5 MW which is less than the small-scale limit.
5. The physical, geographical site of the renewable energy generation delineates the project
boundary.
The project boundary was defined as Rima’s plant site in Bocaiúva.
6. For renewable energy technologies that displace technologies using fossil fuels, the simplified
baseline is the fuel consumption of the technologies that would have been used in the absence of the
project activity times an emission coefficient for the fossil fuel displaced. IPCC default values for
emission coefficients may be used.
The simplified baseline is the fuel oil that would have been consumed in the baseline scenario times the
IPCC default emission factor.
8. If the energy generating equipment is transferred from another activity or if the existing
equipment is transferred to another activity, leakage is to be considered.
Since the burner for charcoal fines was newly designed and manufactured and the formerly used
equipment was not transferred to another activity leakage was not considered.
9. Monitoring shall consist of:
(a) Metering the energy produced by a sample of the systems where the simplified baseline is based
on the energy produced multiplied by an emission coefficient.

CDM-SSC-PDD (version 02)
CDM – Executive Board page 10
The metering of the energy produced is achieved by monitoring the biomass consumed times the net
calorific value.

897,project_description,"2.1.1 Summary Description of the Project(G1.2)
“Community Forest Plantation in India” is a combined Afforestation and sustainable
development project carried out by farmers with the help of a project implementer. The
associated project implementer is helping farmers to plant trees on the land which is identified as
unproductive, and the area is highly water scarce. Farmers retain ownership of the trees,
products, and land as well. Farmers received training from the project implementer for plantation
and the project implementer (Greenovation) is providing plantation material (saplings, manure) to
the farmers and further assistance in maintaining the required survival rate of the plantation.
Carbon credits generated from this project will help in maintaining the survival rate of planted
trees and support farmers. The total area expected to be covered in the project is around 10,000
hectares. The current plantations have been covered to plant 4,400 hectares in the country.
The project implementer is Greenovation empowering the large group of farmers in India by
managing and planting the less productive land to increase forest cover by establishing the forest.
project implementer helps in managing and planting Agroforestry species (Refer to the table:1) to
promote the additional income from NTFPs (Non-Timber Forest Products) and fruits production
for participating farmers. Carbon credit sales will generate income and provide project funding to
address agricultural, nutritional and fuel challenges arising among the communities. Further, as
the project implementer will expand to more groups and more areas, it ensures more trees, more
biodiversity, and more climate change benefits with more income for local people. The carbon
credits from this project activity will also create a new ‘virtual’ cash crop for the participants, who
gain all the direct benefits of growing trees and receive benefits based on the GHG benefits
created by their efforts (as a result-based payment approach). The maturing trees and
Conservation Farming will provide additional sustainable benefits such as Climate change
mitigation and carbon sequestration, watershed management, soil improvement and biodiversity
richness. The project activity includes improved knowledge, an improved environment, and
marketable commodities such as fruits, nuts, honey and other NTFPs. The project zone will be
known for a very healthy wild population of flora and fauna and create a forest to provide suitable
habitat for multiple birds and other native species. The project will also mitigate the human-wildlife
conflict by conserving more and more natural resources and decreasing the dependency on the
native forest to fulfil the resource requirement. project implementer is supporting as an
administrative backbone that supplies training in building nurseries, tree planting, Conservation
Farming, and exchange of technical knowledge. Project implementer is available to everyone,
and all are considered equal. The rotating leadership and the Small Group rules, empower
women and undereducated people. Those who will be the most successful, regardless of
education levels or gender, become mentors and leaders. This project seeks to maximize
environmental and social impact while supporting and improving existing activities. Planting trees
on community-owned land in conjunction with agricultural activities is minimally disruptive, which
results in virtually no leakage or baseline emission.

The project participants are using the afforestation approach and planted thousands of trees on
the land across the project boundary. In case of the absence of this project activity land would be
continued to be less productive land or degraded land. The project will help in mitigating climate
change for the next 40 years by sequestrating/removing the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
and creating a carbon pool. The project activity will result in an annual average of 1,40,882 tons
of GHG removal and total removal of 56,35,266 tons of CO2 over the 40 years of the period.",3549,3549_ccb_vcs_project_description_version._1.1.pdf,project_description,{'project_country': 'India'},"What is the project province, country, latitude, and longitude of this project?","{'project_state_province': 'Multiple States', 'project_country': 'India', 'project_latitude': 20.59, 'project_longitude': 78.96}"

Project activity’s contribution to sustainable development
This project activity by its inherent nature of green electricity
generation stimulates sustainable development of Maharashtra and
Tamilnadu in several ways as described as under:
Social- economic wellbeing:
· The proposed project activity is situated in remote rural
location. The project activity has contributed significantly
to the economic development of the region by generating income
through land sale, permanent and temporary employment
generation by onsite (construction site) as well as offsite
(technology suppliers/manufacturers) employment opportunities.
· The operation and maintenance of the power plant also needs
skilled manpower and professionals. Moreover, the local job
opportunities also help in minimizing migration to urban
areas.
· The infrastructure in and around the project area will also
improve due to project activity.
· The generated electricity is fed into the regional grids,
thereby improving the availability of electricity to the local
consumers (villagers & sub-urban habitants) which will provide
new opportunities for industries and economic activities
ultimately leading to overall development.
Environmental well being:
· Regional grids are highly dependent on fossil fuels which emit
greenhouse gases and other harmful pollutants (NOx, SOx, PM,
flyash, etc.) in the atmosphere. The wind technology in the
project activity is environmentally safe and will contribute
towards reducing the emissions of GHGs and other pollutants.
· In summary - promotion of such projects ensures adequate power
supply, improved air quality, conservation of natural
resources (fossil fuels), alternative sources of energy and
improved local livelihoods.
Technology well being:
· The project activity implementation will set an example for
other industries/business houses to come up with similar
projects for sustainable power generation.
· In addition, the project activity will also encourage
technology suppliers and manufactures to put in more
efforts/funds for further improvement of equipment/machinery
and help in removing technological barriers in such projects.
The project activity meets the approved guidelines for CDM projects
stipulated by the Government of India and received Letter of
Approval (HCA) from National DNA on 29/01/2009.

Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Sailin Company). 18,920.2 ha of forest was planted on barren lands in
the District from 2018 to 2058.
The Project involves a total of 10 villages and towns in Chongli District, with a total population of
126,69412 people in 2015. All the barren lands for afforestation activities belong to the village committees.
Sailin Company has been fully authorized by the local government through a signed contract to act as the
project proponent to implement project implementation, management, monitoring and to sell VCUs
generated from the project. This enables Sailin Company to consolidate the forest resources into sizeable
a forestry offset project. The implementation of the project activity has provided 12,000 jobs for local
villagers.
The project activity aims to:
- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate change;
- Enhance biodiversity conservation by increasing the connectivity of forests;
- Improve soil and water conservation in the mountainous region and increase the forest cover;
- Generate income and job opportunities for local village communities.
There is no natural renewal and afforestation before the project, and all sites were covered by barren land.
The main species planted are pinus sylvestris, larch and spruce which are the native species according
to the baseline survey.
The implementation of the project would reduce GHG emissions amounting to 1,942,066tCO e over the 2
20 years crediting period, with an average annual GHG emission of 97,103 tCO e. 2

935,sector,"5.1.3 Net Positive Biodiversity Impacts (B2.2, GL1.4)
The without-project scenario is rather bleak for biodiversity. Generations of human occupation
and farming have made the Project Area biodiversity-poor. With TIST it has improved. We have
planted and maintained 411,068 indigenous trees, covering 1,653 ha and contained in 14,601
Project Areas. These are islands of biodiversity in a degraded landscape matrix that provide
connectivity among the natural forests and other islands of biodiversity. There are over 19,073
total Project Areas operated by farmers that are receiving ongoing training in biodiversity and
natural resource management. Those of these that do not have indigenous trees still provide
forest cover. In addition, there are 305,097 fruit and nut trees covering 1,208.67 ha. These
provide a source of food and nectar for bees, birds, small animals living on, or around, the farms
and larger animals when present.
An Environmental Impact Audit was carried out by Natural Resources Management &
Development Agency (NAREDA Consultants) in Meru and Nanyuki areas of Kenya,60 to assess
the environmental conditions and biodiversity of the area and to assess positive and negative
environmental impacts of TIST project activities. The EIA and other assessments indicate that
the Project Areas themselves were not areas rich in biodiversity. However, some areas border
Mt Kenya and conserved forest, areas rich in biodiversity. By providing fuel wood from
sustainable wood lots and improving livelihoods, the project should have a positive effect on
biodiversity.
Promotion of Conservation Farming will further reduce pressure on forestland by increasing food
productivity by, and consequently decreasing pressure for, land clearing for agriculture.
Biodiversity is also enhanced directly through the planting of indigenous trees, both in specific
riparian ‘biodiversity’ groves, and through dispersed inter-planting, homestead planting and
woodlots. Increases in tree biodiversity should also enhance diversity of associated species,
including pollinators, and other beneficial species, while protection of riparian areas will improve
water quality and provide other important ecosystem services.
Comparing the without-project scenario and with-project conditions, it has been demonstrated
that the project has a net positive impact on biodiversity.",737,737_tist_ke_pd-vcs-005n_app13_verif_03_monitoring_rpt_200522v3.pdf,sector,{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'},"What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?",{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}

energy (renewable sources) and same is exported to the NEWNE and southern grid systems, which are presently
dominated by thermal energy sources. The Proposed project activity is well below the qualifying limit of project
activities under the small scale methodology AMS.I.D i.e. 15MW. Hence, AMS.I.D „Grid connected renewable
electricity generation‟ is applied to this small scale project activity.

999,crediting period,"1.9 Project Crediting Period
As per section 3.8.3 in the VCS standards requirement for AFOLU projects, the crediting period
for this program should be a minimum of 20 years with a maximum of 4 renewals within the
maximum 100-year crediting period.
Aligned with the most impactful carbon sequestration period, we have chosen a 25-year crediting
period with 3 possible renewals. This period also aligns with the minimum generational period
from which the subsequent generation would start taking over farming operations and the
probability of changing practices is heightened. Therefore, the end of the crediting period is a
sensible period to re-assess baseline practices in line with the updated commonly adopted
practices in the region.

The Sectoral scope of this project corresponds to VCS Sectoral scope 14 (Agriculture, Forestry and
Other Land Use) and is categorized under VCS AFOLU category Reduced Emissions from
Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) as it seeks to reduce deforestation and degradation and to
enhancecarbon.
According to VCS Standard v4.2, the actions that reduce net GHG emissions by stopping
deforestation and/or forest degradation are considered eligible REDD activities. The activities
that directly influence degradation and deforestation, such as animal grazing, unsustainable
fuelwood extraction, unsustainable timber removal, or other such activities, need to be tackled
in order to reduce the emission of GHG. These unplanned activities leading to forest
degradation (AUDD) can be avoided through specific interventions that directly address the
respective drivers of degradation, for example, forest patrolling and fencing to control
unsustainable fuelwood and NTFP extraction, capacity-building programs to generate
alternative livelihood options and to control forest fire, incorporating rotational grazing,
providing van panchayat members with chaff-cutter, improved fodder plants to address
overgrazing, improved forest management practices and building trenches, chal-khal etc.

1034,sector,"2.5 Description of how the emissions of GHG by source in baseline scenario are
reduced below those that would have occurred in the absence of the project
activity (assessment and demonstration of additionality):
Referred by the Baseline Methodology, the “Tool for the Demonstration and Assessment of
Additionality Version 05.2” outlines a step by step approach for the assessment of additionality or in
other words the emission reductions that would have occurred in the absence of the project.
Step 1: Identification of alternatives to the project activity consistent with current laws and
regulations
Sub-step 1a: Define alternatives to the project activity
In the absence of the proposed project activity, plausible and credible project activities to the
proposed project activity are as follows:
Alternative 1 : Construction of a thermal power plant with the same annual power output
Alternative 2 : The proposed project activity not undertaken as a VER project activity
Alternative 3 : Construction of some other renewable energy plant with the same annual power
output
Alternative 4 : The same service of power supply is provided from the grid (Lamas III-IV HEPP
is not built)
The project area region is rich of wind at some level and but the construction of wind mills would
result in the destruction of lemon and other citrus production, which provides the main livelihood in
the area. There is no geothermal source in the region either. Thus, Alternative 3 for the region is
eliminated.
As mentioned above, the Turkish Electricity Sector is heavily dependent on fossil fuel plants.
According to a new bill that passed in 2001, the public funding in energy investments have stopped.
The new bill allows incentives for private sector participation in energy investments. In addition to
rehabilitation of existing plants, new capacities to be added to meet the increasing demand require
mass amount of investments. Because the public funding of energy investments is no more
legitimate, the new projects need to be accomplished by private sector. Yet, TGT cannot influence
the future fuel mix but can only decide to invest on the project or not. Under these circumstances,
the only realistic alternatives are 2 and 4. Analyzing these two alternatives, it is seen that both
scenarios are consistent with the baseline definition of ACM0002 where it defines the baseline
scenario as the amount of electricity that would be delivered to the grid by the project activity,
generated by the operation of existing grid-connected power plants and by the addition new
generation sources, as reflected by the combined margin.
Sub-step 1b: Enforcement of applicable laws and regulations
The alternatives discussed above are in line with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
Step 2: Investment Analysis

The IRR of the project is compared against an investment benchmark which is derived by the CAPM
scientific model (Option III).
Sub-step 2b: Option III. Apply Benchmark Analysis
In order to elaborate a scientific benchmark for renewable energy investments the Capital Asset
Pricing Model(CAPM) by Jack Treynor et al will be applied. In this model the expected return on the
capital asset is calculated as follows:
E = R + ß * E RI f im RM
E = is the expected return on the capital asset RI
R = is the risk-free rate of interest f
ß = (the beta coefficient) the sensitivity of the asset returns to market returns im
E = is the expected return of the market RM
Profitability of long-term securities (Risk Free Rate)
As there is no data available for a commonly used risk free rate in Turkey, 30 year Eurobond which
was issued by Treasury of Republic of Turkey was used as the proxy for the risk free rate in the
country. The most recent data available yield for this bond was 7.158% as of 11th of April 2008.19
Specific risk
The Beta coefficient of securities with values close to 1 determines the company securities as being of
average risk. There are four power generating and trading companies under trade in the Istanbul
Stock Exchange (ISE). The average Beta for these four companies is calculated based on the data
provided by independent sources.
Table 2.9: Average Beta Estimation for ISE (Istanbul Stock Exchange) Energy Companies
Market risk premium
“The market risk premium used in the countries of the Eurozone is 4.91%. In regions of Central and
Eastern Europe the market risk premium is ranging from 5.66% in Slovenia to 19.91% in Moldova.
An independent study of Aswath Damodaran – Stern School of Business (New York University),
offers an assessment of the market risk for different countries according to their credit ratings as the
determined market risk premium for Turkey is 9.29%, calculated on the basis of the credit rating Ba3
with positive perspective given to Turkey by Moody‟s. 21
7.158% + 9.29%* 0.9523 = 16,0049 %
Market risk premium estimation displays that the inclusion of VCU raises the IRR to a more
acceptable level regarding the risk premium that needs to be compensated by the project.

IRR Calculation of the Project
During the planning phase of the project in 2004 a cash flow analysis had been prepared for the
project by the company. Aiming to show that the income of the VCU is important for the financial
performance of the project, two scenarios are presented in this section, one which excludes revenues
from the sale of VCUs and the second which includes the revenues from the sale of VCUs. The
assumptions used for this analysis are outlined as follows:
 The financial analysis is performed over the 20 year period from 2009 to 2028, this, therefore
includes the investments made by the project owner between 2005 and 2009 and the
operational costs along the lifetime of the project.
 The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of the project cash flow has been calculated.
 Annual operational cost of € 1,619,870 has been assumed along the project lifetime
 A tax rate of 20% is applied to the project in line with Turkish tax laws.
 The depreciation period of machinery and equipment was assumed as 10 years as the local
law allows companies to depreciate machinery and equipment in 10 years. Actually this is a
conservative approach as far as the benchmark analysis is concerned. With an assumption of
20 years depreciation period, which is actually in line with the real life conditions, the project
IRR without VER revenue drops to 14.3% from 14.6% (Please see below the revised IRR
calculations with 20 years depreciation period assumption). In the meantime, the other fixed
assets‟ (buildings etc) depreciation life is assumed as 50 years.
Table 2.10: VER Effect on IRR
 For labour expenses, annual cost of labour in the project‟s region is estimated for each
specific job descriptions. Actually, this is still on the on the conservative side as far as the
Turkey averages are concerned. According to Turkish Employer Unions Confederation, the
average cost of employee in Turkey is YTL 3,183 per month (around Euro 1,768) as of
January 2008 (http://www.tisk.org.tr/gostergeler.asp?id=524). However, the average cost of
labour per month assumption in the IRR calculation was Euro 1,308.
 The annual power generation figure is 150,573 kWh.
 The power purchase price for the project is assumed to be 5 Euro cent per kWh which is the
minimum purchase guarantee offered by the State as an incentive to the investment (Please
refer to Turkish Renewable Energy Law No: 5346 Article 6.c.)
 The revenues from VCUs are excluded from scenario 1, and included in scenario 2. The
volume of VCUs generated by the project is calculated by multiplying the annual electricity
output of the project by the emission factor. For sensitivity analysis, the revenues related to
the sale of the VCUs are applied by multiplying the volume of VCUs by the €5, €6 and €7
price. The VCUs are generated and sold between 2009 and 2018 for ten years.
Results
The cash flow analysis has been performed on two project scenarios;
 Scenario 1 – excludes revenues from the sale of VCU
 Scenario 2 – includes revenues from the sale of VCUs

activity:
>>
The consolidated methodology ACM0004 applies to project activities that generate electricity from waste
heat or the combustion of waste gases in industrial facilities. The consolidated methodology ACM0004
applies to electricity generation project activities:
• that displace electricity generation with fossil fuels in the electricity grid or displace captive
electricity generation from fossil fuels;
• where no fuel switch is done in the process, where the waste heat or pressure or the waste gas is
produced, after the implementation of the project activity.
The Project is to displace electricity generation by fossil fuel-fired power plants in the Central China
Grid, and no fuel switch activity is induced in the process in which the waste gas is generated after the
implementation of the project activity, therefore the consolidated methodology ACM0004 is applicable
to the Project.
According to the consolidated methodology ACM0004, the consolidated baseline methodology
ACM0004 is applied in compliance with the consolidated monitoring methodology ACM0004, and the
emission factor of baseline grid electricity displaced by net electricity supply of the Project is calculated
as per ACM0002, the additionality of the Project is demonstrated and assessed by using the Tool for the
Demonstration and Assessment of Additionality approved by CDM EB.",12,12_chuanwei_cdm_pdd.pdf,methodology,{'project_methodologies': ['ACM0002']},What is the methodology of this project?,{'project_methodologies': ['ACM0002']}

Project Location
The grouped project is located in Port Loko District in the Northwestern province of Sierra Leone. The
location is between latitudes 8.63 and 9.12, and longitudes -12.52 and -13.63. Inside the project
boundary, multiple project sites with ecoclimatic conditions and soil properties suitable for growing the
selected species are in different plots. The location and geodetic coordinates are provided in a separate
KML file.
Before starting any project activities, all potential plots have been thoroughly evaluated. This evaluation

project matters. The country office of the REC (Regional Environmental Center) in Turkey took the
role of a National Focal Point for UNFCCC Article 6.
The project is located in the Black Sea Region of Turkey, within the province of Giresun. The
project is on the Cakrak Creek, 1 km. before the river merges with Ekin Creek to form Yagli Brook.
The altitude at the location is 849.50 m. Prior to project initiation, the project area did not host any
agricultural or livestock production activity due its altitude. The project site had been vacant as the
project is a new power unit and it did not replace an old plant.
The project’s geographical location is 40º 37´ 51´´ North 38º 35´ 43´´ East.

has generated over 1,000,000 tonnes of validated and verified Voluntary Emission Reductions (VERs)
which have been supplied to the domestic and international offset markets. Today, ERA works around
the world with forward-looking communities, ethical companies, and indigenous groups to restore and
protect forest ecosystems, building local capacity to play a role in climate change mitigation and
adaptation.
Wildlife Works is the world’s leading REDD project development and management company with an
effective approach to applying innovative market-based solutions to the conservation of biodiversity.
Over a 15 year history, Wildlife Works established a successful model that uses the emerging
marketplace for REDD carbon offsets to protect threatened forests, wildlife and communities. The
company helps local landowners in the developing world monetize their forest and biodiversity assets,
whether they are governments, communities, ownership groups or private individuals. Wildlife Works is
actively leveraging its experience to future REDD projects around the globe, with a goal to protect 5
million hectares from deforestation. Wildlife Works is committed to protecting wildlife, forests and
biodiversity, with a direct, hands-on approach to creating alternative livelihoods.",934,934_proj_desc_934_19nov2012.pdf,project_proponents,"[{'organization_name': 'Wildlife Works Carbon LLC', 'telephone': '+1-415-332-8081', 'email': 'accounting@wildlifeworks.com', 'country': 'United States'}]","What is the project proponents, includind organization name, phone number and email address, state/city and country of the entity responsible for managing this carbon project?","[{'organization_name': 'Wildlife Works Carbon LLC', 'telephone': '+1-415-332-8081', 'email': 'accounting@wildlifeworks.com', 'country': 'United States'}]"

1116,project_description,"2.1.1 Summary Description of the Project (G1.2)
Yunnan Yulong Afforestation Project (hereafter refer to as “the project”) is located in Yulong Naxi
Autonomous County, Lijiang City, Yunnan Province of China, which is the only Naxi13 Autonomous
County in China. The project aims to plant native species on suitable land for forest14 for GHG removal
whilst contributing to local sustainable development goals.
37,400.59 ha (561,008.85 Mu15) of the forest was planted on suitable land for forest in Yulong Naxi
Autonomous County, which used to be poor sustainable ecological environment and rocky desertification.
Prior to the project, although the project area is suitable for planting trees, it lacks proper forestry
management, resulting in lower coverage of trees. Besides, there has never been any activity affecting
the local ecosystem in the project area16. By checking the afforestation plan with Yulong Naxi
Autonomous County Forestry and Grassland Bureau, it was confirmed that, a small number of trees have
been planted in some project area before the project started, but the coverage rate was extremely low. So,
considering the lower forest coverage, Yulong Naxi Autonomous County Forestry and Grassland Bureau
determined that the project area is suitable for afforestation after investigation, then the supplementary
planting without disturbing the existing trees was approved to increase the vegetative cover. All the trees
were planted without disturbing the existing trees in this project, and only the trees actually planted in this
project were monitored. The carbon credit of the original trees in the baseline scenario will not be
monitored or counted in the actual net GHG removals by sinks.
The project activity aims to:
- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate change;
- Enhance biodiversity conservation by increasing the connectivity of forests;
- Improve soil and water conservation in the mountainous region and increase the forest cover;
13 Naxi nationality is one of the 55 ethnic minorities in China.
14 According to the “Chinese terms in resource and technology” issued by the China Science Publishing &
Media Ltd., the definition of suitable land for forest refers to the land type with suitable site conditions for
forest growth programmed by People’s governments at or above the county level. The suitable land for
forest described in this project is programmed by Yulong Naxi Autonomous County Forestry and
Grassland Bureau, and a small number of trees have been planted in some project area before the
project started but the coverage rate of planting trees is low, so the Yulong Naxi Autonomous County
Forestry defines the project area as the suitable land for forest.

2.1.10 SectoralScopeandProjectType
According to Appendix of 1 Eligible AFOLU Project Categories of the VCS Standard
(version 4.4), eligible Agricultural Land Management (ALM) activities are those that reduce
net GHG emissions on croplands and grasslands by increasing carbon stocks in soils and
woody biomass and/or decreasing CO , N O and/or CH emissions from soils, which 2 2 4
include Improved Cropland Management (ICM), Improved Grassland Management (IGM)
andCroplandandGrasslandLanduseConversions(CGLC).
Degraded grassland was restored by planting grass and management of reasonable
grazing activities to increase soil carbon stocks. So, the project is developed under VCS
scope 14 “Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)” with a project category of
Agricultural Land Management (ALM), and belongs to the category of Improved Grassland
Management (IGM) that demonstrably reduce net GHG emissions of grassland ecosystems
byincreasingsoilcarbonstocks.Theprojectisnotagroupedproject.

Total 107,326.16 ha of degraded grassland have been managed sustainably by fence
construction, degraded grassland improvement and pest control. These sustainable and
scientificmanagementsof grassland reducednet GHGemissions byincreasingcarbonsink
capacity and/or reducing non-CO GHG emissions, which also improved local biodiversity 2
and enhance the capabilities of local communities and residents. Three restoration
measuresintheprojectareshownbelow：
1. The project implements fence construction mainly containing rotational grazing and
rest grazing in 18,713.33 ha of degraded grassland to achieve sustainable grassland
management. Grazing was strictly prohibited for the first two years, and then rotational
grazing in different project areas will be applied to protect the natural grassland
resourcesandmitigatethedegradationoftheecologicalenvironment.
2. Degraded grassland improvement was also implemented in moderately degraded
areas, 29,355.99 ha of degraded grassland have been managed sustainably by the
implementation of seeding, reseeding and applying fertilizer, where grass seeds of
local high-quality forage were sowed such as Elymus nutans Griseb, Poa crymophila
Keng cv Qinghai, Elymus dahuricus Turcz, Roegneria grandiglumis Keng and Festuca
sinensis Keng.cv.Qinghai.Rotational grazing. Rotational grazing was carried out in

climate, land use history and socio-economic conditions.
Project area was stratified to homogenize the population and achieve more accurate results in the
variables measured. The preliminary stratification was done prior to the implementation of the
measurements and was established in the Monitoring Plan of the Project Design. The strata were defined
with two main variables: tree species and plantation date.

Locator, shows dozens of companies currently listed as biomass recyclers19. This database can
be queried to find a number of companies that specialize in the collection, processing and
transportation of biomass residues within the same transportation radius as Metrolina
Greenhouses. Service providers are listed by type of material accepted and encompass all likely
sources of material that would be used as potential fuel for Metrolina. A search of individual
websites of companies listed on the Recycler Center locator showed that many operations
function as waste collection and transfer stations, then process the material and sell it as mulch,
hog fuel, or fiber product for other wood related industries. These industries and “waste
pathways” are likely to remain in business for the duration of the crediting period. As such, there
are no leakage emissions to be associated with the processing and collection of eligible biomass
materials for Metrolina Greenhouses.
Details and quantification procedures for relevant leakage sources and the management plan for
quantifying these potential emissions are located within section 3.3 of this PD.

3.1
In accordance with the baseline and monitoring methodology AMS-I.C., the following definitions
of the project boundary shall hold true for the project activity:
The spatial extent of the project boundary encompasses:
(a) All plants generating power and/or heat located at the project site, whether fired with biomass,
fossil fuels or a combination of both;
(c) Industrial, commercial or residential facility, or facilities, consuming energy generated by the
system and the processes or equipment affected by the project activity;
The spatial extent of the project boundary does not include items b, d, and f of paragraph 15 of
baseline and monitoring methodology AMS I. C. as they are not applicable to the project activity.
It should also be noted that transportation itineraries of biomass transported over distances
greater than 200 km (15.e of AMS I.C ver 19) are discussed as part of leakage emissions.
The project boundary for the project activity therefore shall encompass the following area:
• The boiler house (location of the 4 biomass boiler systems) on Metrolina property.
• Existing natural gas boilers dispersed throughout Metrolina facility
• The Metrolina greenhouse facilities located at the project site that utilizes any of the
thermal energy produced by the biomass boiler systems.
Table 3 below describes the sources of GHG emissions and specific gases identified as GHG
emissions included in the project boundary. In addition to the identified gases are the various
levels of control over which the project owner has in relation to the specific emissions generated
through the project activity.

According to Annex A of the Kyoto Protocol, this project fits in Sectoral Category 1, Energy Industries
(renewable/non renewable).
A.4.3. Technology to be employed by the project activity:
>>
The purpose of the Project is to use well established wind power generation technology for electricity
generation and transmission to generate low emissions electricity for the Grid thereby displacing CO 2
emissions from electricity generation from the Grid. The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario
existing prior to the start of the implementation of the project activity: electricity delivered to the Grid by
the project would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by
the addition of new generation sources. The Grid includes the Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong
and Inner Mongolia Provincial Power Grids.
The proposed project involves the installation of 66 wind turbines each of which with a rated capacity of
750kW, providing a total capacity of 49.5MW. The expected annual electricity supply to the grid is
119,226MWh. The height of the rotor hub of all turbines is 60m. As the wind resource in the area is
plentiful, and the average wind speed is relatively high, averaging7.9m/s at a height of 55m and 8.1m/s at
a height of 65m, the wind resources are sufficient to run a wind farm at the location.
The construction includes a 220kV step-up substation. The wind power to be generated will be delivered
to the 220kV step-up substation by 35kV transmission lines. The electricity will be delivered from the
220kV step-up substation to the existing Huitengliang 220kV transformer substation. From the 220 kV
substation the electricity generated will be transmitted to the Inner Mongolia Power Grid.
Details on the monitoring equipments and their location are given in section B.7.2. of the PDD.",556,556_proj_desc_556_29oct2009.pdf,project_description,{'project_country': 'China'},"What is the project province, country, latitude, and longitude of this project?","{'project_state_province': 'Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region', 'project_country': 'China', 'project_latitude': 43.5, 'project_longitude': 116.22}"

Sustainable Development
v3.3 10

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
The National CDM Authority (NCDMA), the Designated National Authority (DNA) for
Government of India (GoI), has stipulated four indicators of sustainable development in
pursuant to their approval guidelines for Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects
from India. This project activity under VCS also contributes towards these sustainable
development indicators, as follows:
Social well-being:
(cid:1) The project activity has been contributing to socio-economic development in the
region through improving the infrastructure for road network and other mode of
communications in the remote part of the state during both the construction and
operational phases.
(cid:1) The project activity has been supporting to alleviate poverty by means of direct
and indirect benefits through employment generation and improved economic
activities by strengthening of local grid of the state electricity utility. Thus,
contributes to the livelihood of the society.
Environmental well-being:
(cid:1) The project activity utilizes renewable energy source for electricity generation
instead of fossil fuel based electricity generation which would have emitted
gaseous, liquid and/or solid effluents/wastes. Thus, the project causes no
negative impact on the surrounding environment and contributes to
environmental well-being.
(cid:1) The project activity contributes towards reduction of the GHG emissions as well
as emission of pollutants like SOx, Suspended Particulate Matters (SPMs) etc.
as in absence of the project an equivalent amount of power (for captive
consumption) would have been drawn from Grid which is pre-dominantly
supplied by fossil fuel based power plants associated with high level of SOx,
NOx, SPMs etc.
Economic well-being:
(cid:1) The project generates electricity utilizing renewable source, i.e. wind. Thus it will
increase the contribution of renewable based power generation in the region and
will also help in reducing the demand - supply gap of the respective grid.
(cid:1) The project activity involves substantial amount of investment, manpower,
operational amenities etc. Thus it contributes towards generation of direct and
indirect employment opportunities as per the requirement of the skilled and semi-
skilled manpower, both during construction and operational phase.
(cid:1) Use of a renewable source of energy reduces the dependence on imported fossil
fuels and associated price variation, which leads to economic stability of the
nation. Also, it leads to increased energy security.

Eligibility Criteria
The grouped project is expected to include instances that apply any kind of ARR technology within the
geographical region of the Grouped project. These may be either FMNR and EP activities (as applied in
the first instance) or the establishment of other technologies such as agroforestry systems or wood lots
for the production of firewood and other products.
At the time of the preparation of this PD only two instances are envisaged:
• Jama-Urji Farmers Managed Forestry Project: Which applies FMNR and EP technologies and it
is planned to a sufficient level of detail to enable its validation;
• Galo Hirphe project: This project It is located in the rift valley, 170 km from Addis Ababa, South-
East Ziway town. This instance is still in early stages of development, and it is not planned to a
sufficient level of detail to include in this version of the PD.
Since the initial instance (which is the only planned instance of the grouped project) consists in the
establishment of FNMR and EP within Ethiopia, in the current version of the PD, these will be the only
technologies and geographical region covered by the framework of this grouped project.
Additional technologies might be added in the future such as Agroforestry activities or wood lots with
commercial species in other areas. Instances using other technologies are not part of this grouped project
and would have to be included within the Grouped Project through a Project Description deviation and by
completing the description of the technology and measure within this PD.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1.8 Description of the Project Activity
1.9 Project Location
The Project is spread across Agadgaon, Ratadgaon, Ranjani, Balewadi and Pimpalgaon Ghat
villages in Khandke Taluka of Ahmednagar District of Maharashtra state in India.
The Project area extends between latitude 19o, 6’ to 19o, 11’ North and longitude 74o, 49.5’ to 74o,
57.5’ East. The Project is connected to the Enercon (India) Limited (EIL) substation (to be owned
by MSETCL) at Village Mehekari (near 33kV Mehekari S/S), Ahmednagar district. The Project
activity is located at a distance of 120 km from Pune by road. The nearest big railway station is at
Pune.
The details of the physical location of the project activity are presented in Annexure 01

The Project activity is exporting power to the Western Regional Electricity Grid (part of NEWNE
Grid) which is dominated by fossil fuel fired thermal power stations. The grid is also experiencing
power deficit and hence the addition of wind energy generation is helping in avoiding excessive
GHG emissions by supplying similar amount of power from other grid connected power plants
and meeting the requirement of power demand.
The electricity generated from the Project activity is getting sold to the Maharashtra State
Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. (MSEDCL) under a long term power purchase agreement. The
wind power project generates electricity and will replace the electricity that would otherwise have
been generated by other grid connected power stations and by addition of new generating
stations.
India has two regional grids i.e. NEWNE (North, Eastern, Western and North-Eastern) grid and
Southern grid. The Project is connected to Western Regional Electricity Grid of the NEWNE Grid
and hence the baseline for the Project activity will be emissions that would have occurred by the
operation of grid connected power stations and by the addition of new generating stations in
NEWNE Grid.
The project activity is a renewable power generation facility which does not emit any kind of GHG
emissions. Hence the project activity has not been implemented to create GHG emissions for the
purpose of the subsequent removal or destruction of GHG emissions.

A.4. Technical description of the project
>>
The direct grid-connected high-speed generator, in combination with the multiple-stage combined
spur/planetary gearbox of the Suzlon Megawatt Series offers greater robustness and reliability than a
low-speed generator connected to the electrical grid via AC-DC-AC-inverter systems. High-speed
asynchronous generator with a multistage intelligent switching compensation system delivers power
factor up to 0.99. The generated power is free from harmonics and is grid friendly.
.
The technology is a clean technology since there are no GHG emissions associated with the electricity
generation.
Supply of wind generated electricity to the grid is replacing the fossil fuel based generated electricity in
the grid, thus lead to reduction of GHG emissions.

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
Site preparation will be carried out in accordance with the technical guidelines and procedures given
by the Ministry of Agriculture Development17.
As no, or very low pre-existing vegetation is present within project boundary (GIOES & APOR, 2006),
site preparation will only consist in punctual soil preparation before tree plantation. Soil preparation
consists in building anti-erosion constructions with the aim to limit wind erosion and retain water down
trees. These constructions are called “half-moon” in accordance with their geometric form (see Figure
10 below).
Figure 10. “half-moon” anti-erosion work (Photo: T.Dufour)
Depending on tree planting density, the area of soil disturbed by half-moon construction was estimated
between 2% and 3.5% of the project area.

1227,methodology,"2.2 Applicability of Methodology
AR-ACM0003 is applicable under the following conditions:
(a) The land subject to the project activity does not fall in wetland category;
IPCC wetland definition13:”A typical wetland soil with a high water table and an organic layer of
at least 40 cm thickness (poorly drained organic soil)”. No such soils exist in the project area.
(b) Soil disturbance attributable to the afforestation and reforestation (A/R) clean development
mechanism (CDM) project activity does not cover more than 10 per cent of area in each of
the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project boundary:
i. Land containing organic soils;
As shown by the soil analysis in annexe 8, there are no organic soils in the project area
ii. Land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and
receives inputs listed in appendices 1 and 2 to this methodology.
The project area consists mainly of moderately – severely degraded grassland, without
any inputs which are not listed in the appendices of the methodology. Rice production in
the valleys is done in full tillage systems with no or very little input of external organic
material, which is neither listed in the appendices.
The project baseline further builds up on the AR-ACM0001 eligibility criterion for demonstrating that
baseline carbon stocks are decreasing: The A/R CDM project activity is implemented on degraded
lands14, which are expected to remain degraded or to continue to degrade in the absence of the
project, hence the land cannot be expected to revert to a non-degraded state without human
intervention.
As described in the “Tool for the identification of degraded or degrading lands for
consideration in implementing CDM A/R project activities”, an initial screening of lands to
determine whether the area has been classified as “degraded” under any verifiable local,
regional, national or international land classification system or credible study produced within
the last ten years has been done.
The FAO map from 2004 below15 shows the erosion situation in Madagascar. The Sofia
Region (pointed on the map by an arrow) in the Mahajanga District is classified under
“severe”.
Since the classification of the project area is as a degraded land and the data not older than
10 years, the land can be considered as “degraded”.
13 Definition from the IPCC, 2003, Volume 4, Chapter 4
14 The latest version of the tool “Tool for the identification of degraded or degrading lands for
consideration in implementing CDM A/R project activities” shall be applied for
demonstrating that lands are degraded or degrading.

extent of the project boundary includes the project power plant and all power plants connected
physically to the electricity system that the CDM project power plant is connected to. The project
boundary covers the biomass gasifier, IC engine coupled with generator, NEWNE region grid,
where all power plants are physically connected to the electricity system. The figure below shows
the pictorial representation of the project boundary.
The proposed project activity wheels the power through the NEWNE grid. Therefore, all the
power plants contributing electricity to the Integrated NEWNE Grid have been considered in the
project boundary for the purpose of baseline estimation. The project activity targets reduction of
CO e as main GHG greenhouse gas in baseline, there are no GHG emission associated with 2
project activity.
7 The sum of installed capacities of all generators connected to the mini-grid is equal to or less than 15 MW.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
Fig: Project Boundary
2.4 Baseline Scenario
The project activity is the installation of a new grid-connected biomass gasifier based power plant.
In the project activity, electricity generated by the project is wheeled to the PP own group
company within the same state by utilizing the NEWNE grid, which possesses a mix of generation
types with fossil fuel fired power plants. In the absence of the project activity same amount of
power would have been supplied by the existing fossil fuel based power plants connected to the
grid or addition of similar kind of new power plants, which would have resulted in GHG emissions.
As per para 19 of AMS-I.D. (Version 18) “The baseline scenario is that the electricity delivered to
the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-
connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources into the grid. Project
activity supplies electricity to NEWNE regional grid and Southern regional grid of India. In the
absence of the project activity same amount electricity would have been generated from NEWNE
grid, in which the electricity is generated by the fossil fuel intensive power plant (Coal based).
Thus baseline is in line with para 19 of AMS-I.D. (Version 18).
Para 22 of AMS-I.D. (Version 18) calculates baseline emissions as:
BE = EG × EF . .....(A) y PJ,y grid,.y
Where,
BE = Baseline Emissions in year y; t CO2 y
EG = Quantity of net electricity generation that is produced and fed into the grid as a PJ,y
result of the implementation of the CDM project activity in year y (MWh)
EF = Combined margin CO emission factor for grid connected power generation in grid,.y 2
year y calculated using the latest version of the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an
electricity system” (t CO /MWh) 2

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: VCS Version 3
Based on the above arguments it could be concluded that the methodology ACM0002
“Consolidated baseline methodology for grid-connected electricity generation from
renewable sources” version 17.0.0 is applicable to the proposed project activity.
In addition, the methodologies also refer to several tools described under section 2.1
“Title and Reference of Methodology”. The applicability of these tools has been
discussed below:

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: VCS Version 3
Applicability of “Combined tool to identify the baseline and scenario and
demonstrate additionality” v 06.0.0
The tool for demonstration and assessment of additionality provides a general
framework demonstrating and assessing additionality and is applicable to a wide range
of project types. As referred in ACM0002, the additionality tool is applicable for the
proposed project activity.
Applicability of “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system” v
06.0.:
This methodological tool determines the CO emission factor for displacement of 2
electricity generated by power plants in an electricity system, by calculating the
“combined margin” emission factor (CM) of the electricity system. This tool may be
applied to estimate the Operating Margin, Build Margin and/or CM when calculating
baseline emissions for a project activity that substitutes grid electricity. As the proposed
project activity supplies electricity to the national grid, the “Tool to calculate the emission
factor for an electricity system” v 06.0. is applicable to the project activity.",1732,1732_proj_desc_1732_05dec2017.pdf,methodology,{'project_methodologies': ['ACM0002']},What is the methodology of this project?,{'project_methodologies': ['ACM0002']}

The project is applicable as respective applicability requirements set by ACM0012 are fulfilled:
(1) The project recovers and utilizes waste heat at an existing facility for the generation of
electricity, while in the absence of the project activity all waste gas would continue to be released
to the atmosphere.
(2) There are no regulations that require the project facility to recover and/or utilize the waste
energy prior to the implementation of the project activity.
(3) It is guaranteed that energy that is released under abnormal operation of the project facility
(for example emergencies or shut downs) shall not be included in the emission reduction
calculations.
(4) The extent of use of waste energy from the waste energy generation facilities in the absence
of the VCS project activity will be determined in accordance with the procedures provided in
Annex 2 (for existing project facilities) to this methodology.

All wetlands are excluded from SCALA operations, including roads, plantation establishment
and harvesting. Should any water courses exist inside company managed areas, these would
fall under control of SCALA reserved from plantation production.

None of the project areas (inner boundary) belong to the category of wetlands (FAO soil type
Gleysol).
(b) Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10 per cent of
area in each of the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project
boundary:
(i) Land containing organic soils;
(ii) land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and
receives inputs listed in appendices 1 and 2 to the methodology.
The project land does not contain organic soils as demonstrated above. The project land does
not receive any inputs according to appendices 1 and 2 of the AR methodology (CDM), but is
subject to shifting agriculture. Because of long periods of fallow vegetation however, it is not
considered to be specific subject to land use.

cultivated with upland rice for mostly one to two years under presumably reduced tillage
management.
(b) The A/R CDM project activity meets the listed conditions. (i) Litter remains on site as there is no
incentive to remove litter from the plots. (ii) Also, soil disturbance associated with the A/R
activity only occurs for planting and is NOT repeated in less than 20 years.

The applicability conditions of tools applicable under the methodology AMS.I. D; are explained as
follows:
 “Tool to calculate project or leakage CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion”- In
accordance with applicable approved methodology AMS I. D. version 18, the proposed
project activity does not involve the project emissions, thus the said tool has not been
used for the project activity under consideration.
 Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system”, (Version 07.0.0), EB 100
Report, Annex 4: The proposed project activity replaces fossil fuel dominated grid
electricity by renewable electricity. Accordingly, this tool has been used to determine
the grid emission factor which is used to estimate the amount of baseline emissions.
The Central Electricity Authority compiled CO baseline database for the Nepal Power 2
Sector. CO 2 baseline database Version 18.02 has been used as reference for the
emission factor. This CO database has been compiled in conjunction with the “Tool to 2
calculate the emission factor for an electricity system”.",4234,4234_vcs_proj_desc_pcp_4234_11may2023.pdf,methodology,{'project_methodologies': ['AMS-I.D.']},What is the methodology of this project?,{'project_methodologies': ['AMS-I.D.']}

Leakage Management
1.16.2

The Forestal Azul Carbon Project aims to increase the carbon stock of former agricultural land
and implanted pastures through afforestation. Leakage would only occur if pre-project activities
by previous owners would be shifted somewhere else in detriment of natural forests and/or
ecosystems. The risk of leakage is low, as deforestation is not allowed in the region, and the
previous owner did not move to an area regarded as an agricultural frontier.
Commercially Sensitive Information
None.
Sustainable Development
The project contributes to the national forest sector by providing proof of concept and
implementation of models aligned to political goals, such as the national plan of reforestation
(Decree Nº 10,147 of 2012), governmental efforts to formalize the biomass sector (Decree Nº
4056/2015), and the contribution to the National Determined Contributions of the country,
where afforestation is highlighted as a prominent measure.
On the other hand, the Forestal Azul Carbon Project will be one of the first to introduce the carbon
component, which will bring about proof of concept and more experience in the region. The
project managers will inform the national authorities of the Project, to avoid any possible double
accounting in the future, and contribute to any governmental efforts in this regard.

2 SAFEGUARDS
2.1 No Net Harm
Summary of environmental impact
 The project seeks to recover degraded natural forests, with potential impact for the whole
country in terms of introducing and providing proof of concept for a viable natural forest
restoration model. Otherwise, these forests are subject to continuous degradation. While the
Government has been introducing other mechanisms to foster forest protection (through
Payments for Environmental Services, for example), these are not yet making a difference
as they are not effectively working on a large scale.
 The project targets areas already heavily modified (used for beef production or mechanized
agriculture) for eucalypt planting. These areas have been deforested decades ago. Tree
planting on these sites reduces erosion, contributes to an improved water household,

sequesters carbon and in some cases, provides better condition for the connection of natural
forests (natural corridors for biodiversity).
 Forestal Azul holds a valid environmental license. While the environmental license is not
subject to exhaustive monitoring by authorities, it is a good tool to ensure compliance to the
most important environmental regulation (such as non-deforestation, maintenance of the
minimum natural forest reserve, and buffer zones), which is evaluated by the Environmental
Ministry through satellite imagery at a frequency of about 2 years.
 The plantations require input such as lime, fertilizer, and pesticides for ant and weed control
(Glyphosate and Fipronil). These are common products in Paraguay, already used before the
activity on these sites. The input use of the plantations is much lower when compared to
agriculture, and roughly the same or slightly higher when compared to beef production.
 To date, all commercial forest plantations are still dependent to a certain degree on using
herbicides. Weed control is particularly important in the first year of plantation
establishment to ensure the survival of the trees. During this time, weed grows faster than
implanted trees leading to strong competition and death of trees if left uncontrolled.
There are several ways of controlling weeds. In Forestal Azul, chemical pesticide control with
Glyphosate is used in combination with manual control and animals that control weeds in
Silvopastoral systems.
Around 4-10 liters / ha are employed for a whole forestry cycle (12 years), usually all in the
first two years (2-3 applications per year). After year 3, herbicides are discontinued or used
very punctually. It should be noted that forest plantations are replacing previous uses where
glyphosate use is more intense. In the first instance, 56 % of plantations are established on
areas previously used for intensive agriculture that require around 15 l/ha/year (in total over
12 years 180 l/ha) and 44 % replacing traditional cattle systems where the use of herbicides
is roughly the same as in forestry when considering the whole forestry cycle. Therefore,
overall, the net environmental impact of forest plantations is strongly positive, reducing the
use of Glyphosate significantly.
Regarding risk mitigation, all pesticides are managed according to best practice, and they are
used specifically and following health and safety standards and environmental mitigation
measures. This is also controlled during annual FSC audits.
Summary of socio-economic impact
 Forestal Azul holds a legal title that is not subject to claims from third parties. During the
due diligence conducted in 2018, conflicts between the former property owners and local
communities were not identified.
 Neighboring community members do not depend on the resources on production sites,
meaning forest production does not restrict local people’s access or use of resources of
critical importance to their livelihoods, or negatively affect ecosystem services. Mostly,
community members have small plots for cultivation and animal husbandry, or work in
neighboring properties.

 Compared to previous land uses, the plantations provide benefits to local people, by
providing local jobs. Plantations forestry provides around 25 Full Time Equivalents per 1,000
ha compared to 2-3 Full Time Equivalents on traditional cattle ranches. This number is even
higher for the degraded natural forest restoration, as it requires high input of manual labour.
Between 2018-2020, Forestal Azul maintained between 30 and 80 employees, most of the
coming from the neighboring community Paso Tuna.
 All labour complies with social security and the labour code. This is a net positive impact in
an environment were 80 % of labour is informal.
 Forestal Azul seeks to introduce productive projects with neighboring community members
starting in 2021. The plan is to establish eucalypt plantations on smallholder land (target is
to work with around 10 to 15 producers and potentially expand in the future), with the
provision of inputs and technical assistance by the company. Income is then shared after
thinning and harvesting.
General safeguards

15 SOCIALCARBON Methodology was developed by Ecológica Institute
(www.ecologica.org.br). It was founded on the principle that transparent
assessment and monitoring of the social and environmental performance of projects
improves their long-term effectiveness. The methodology uses a set of analytical
tools that assess the social, environmental and economic conditions of
communities affected by the project, and demonstrates through continuous
monitoring the project’s contribution to sustainable development.

As mentioned under Type I.C. of ‘Appendix-B2 of the simplified modalities and procedures for small scale
CDM project activities’, project boundary encompasses the physical and geographical site of the
renewable generation source. For the proposed project activity the project boundary is from the point of
fuel storage to the point of electricity and steam supply to the paper mill where the project proponent has
a full control.
Thus, project boundary covers fuel storage, boiler, steam turbine generator and all other accessory
equipments. The project activity is replacing the electricity from northern regional electricity grid also
and the emission factor of grid electricity is most conservative and therefore the northern electricity grid
is also considered under the project boundary.

The project activity is being implemented within the geographical area of the Republic of Lithuania,
the Baltic Sea region of Eastern Europe. The surface area of Lithuania is 65 300 km² with a
population of 2.8 million people. Lithuania is known as an agricultural state with 33.77% of arable
lands. Farmlandsunderannualcashcrops,asreportedbythestatestatisticaldepartment,constitute
ca. 2.2 million ha6. The KML files of the fields will be provided in the individual project
documentation during validation. The program is designed in accordance with the format of a

Electricity in Rajasthan is mainly generated from the fossil fuel dominated power plants (see
section 2.4 for details). In the absence of the project activity, equivalent amount of electricity
would have been generated by the operation of fossil fuel dominated power plants. The
electricity grid is power deficit and hence the new capacity has to be added in the grid system
which would be fossil fuel dominated electricity generation.
PP has installed the project activity at a location which is a barren land and there is no
agriculture activity being undertaken at this site. There is neither any industrial activity
undertaken nor any human displacement done at the site because of the project activity.
The purpose of the present project activity is to harness renewable resources in the region,
and thereby displacing non- renewable natural resources and ultimately leading to sustainable
economic and environmental development. The project activity includes development,
design, engineering, procurement, finance, construction, operation and maintenance of wind
energy based electric generating stations supplying electricity to the RVPNL grid.",299,299_v-3-i-01-s-0028_-_pcc_2.5mw(vcs_pd)_bundled_wind_proj_at_rj_by_aishwarya.pdf,sector,{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'},"What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?",{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}

2.2 Applicability of Methodology
The project activity is of type (I) - renewable energy projects, as it generates electricity from
renewable wind energy. The electricity generated from the project activity is being supplied to the
electricity distribution system, NEWNE grid. Hence, the project activity falls in the project category
– D: electricity generation for a system.
The capacity of the project activity is 10.5 MW which is less than the maximum qualifying capacity
of 15 MW for a small-scale CDM project activity under type-I. The capacity of the project activity
will remain within the limit of 15 MW during the whole crediting period. Hence, the project activity
falls under the small-scale category.
The project activity comprises renewable energy generation units i.e. WTGs and supplies the
electricity to the NEWNE grid for selling to the MSEDCL, an electricity distribution company.
Hence, approved baseline and monitoring methodology, AMS I.D, is applied to the project
activity. The justification for applying AMS I.D is provided below:

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
The average lifetime of the WTGs under project activity is around 25 years as per the equipment
supplier specifications and APERC Tariff order. The plant load factor (PLF) 23% for the project
site is sourced from by third party wind resource assessment.
In the absence of the project activity the equivalent amount of electricity would have been
generated from the southern grid, which is predominantly based on fossil fuels1, hence baseline
scenario of the project activity is the grid based electricity system, which is also the pre-project
scenario.
Apart from the above technical specification of WTGs, the connectivity of all the WTGs is to a
central Monitoring Station (CMS) through high speed WLAN modem or fibre optic cable, which
helps in providing real time status of the turbine at CMS with easy GUI (Graphical User Interface)
and ability to monitor the functioning of the turbine from CMS.
A Supervisory Control & Data Acquisition System (SCADA) provides a graphical representation of
data providing ease to understand the behaviour of WTGs, long time data storage facility, access
to daily generation report and power curve related information & helps to analyze the problem
with graphical tools offline as well as online. The other specifications include a safety system with
instrumentation for tracking individual functions of the wind electric generator.

1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
The project activity is a Greenfield activity that is the installation of new 4.2 MW (2*2100KW
WTG) wind energy based plant for generating electricity. In the absence of the project activity, the
equivalent qunatity of electricity would have been generated by grid mix power plant connected to
southern grid.
1.11 Compliance with Laws, Statutes and Other Regulatory Frameworks
The relevant national laws and regulation pertaining to generation of energy are:
• Electricity Act 2003
• National Electricity Policy 2005
• Tariff Policy 2006
Power generation using wind energy is not a legal requirement or a mandatory option. There are
state and sectoral policies, framed primarily to encourage wind power projects. These policies
have also been drafted realizing the extent of risks involved in the projects and to attract private
investments. As per enviromental act the proposed project activity does not require to carry out
environmental impact assessment. The PP has secured all necessary regulatory and statutory
clearances for WTGs under.
The Indian Electricity Act, 2003 (May 2007 Amendment) does not influence the choice of fuel
used for power generation.
There is no legal requirement on the choice of a particular technology for power generation. The
project activity conforms to all the applicable laws and regulations in India

2.2 Justification of the choice of the methodology and why it is applicable to the
project activity:
The applicability criteria of the methodology AMS-I.D. and their relevance with
respect to the project activity under consideration are addressed as follows:
1. “This category comprises renewable energy generation units, such as
photovoltaics, hydro, tidal/wave, wind, geothermal and renewable biomass, that
supply electricity to and/or displace electricity from an electricity distribution system
that is or would have been supplied by at least one fossil fuel fired generating unit.”
The project activity involves the setting up of wind farms, i.e., renewable generating
units of cumulative generation capacity 11.60 MW to harness a renewable source of
energy (wind power potential) and export the generated electricity to the fossil fuel
dominated electricity generation and distribution system, i.e. the Southern Regional
Electricity Grid of India11. In the process, an equivalent quantum of electricity that
would have been generated by the grid in line with the grid electricity generation mix
is displaced by the project activity. The carbon intensity of the fossil-fuel dominated
generation mix of the grid is evident from the following break-up of various types of
energy sources

VCS Project Description

Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
2. “If the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a
wind/diesel unit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small-scale CDM project activity
applies only to the renewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel, the
capacity of the entire unit shall not exceed the limit of 15MW”.
The project activity involves only wind power generation. The gross wind power
generation capacity of the bundled project activity is 11.60 MW which is less than 15
MW, as stipulated in the applicability criterion under consideration.
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
3. “Combined heat and power (co-generation) systems are not eligible under
this category”
The project activity involves generation of electricity only through WTGs and is not a
co-generation system.
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
4. “In the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy
generation units at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added
capacity of the units added by the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be
physically distinct from the existing units.”
The project activity does not involve the addition of renewable energy generation
units at an existing renewable power generation facility.
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
5. “Project activities that seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for
renewable energy generation are included in this category. To qualify as a small
scale project, the total output of the modified or retrofitted unit shall not exceed the
limit of 15 MW”
The renewable energy generating wind-farms employed by the project activity are
newly constructed set up and do not involve retrofitting or modification of any existing
facility for renewable energy generation.
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
The same is being supported by the purchase orders from the WTG manufactures.
Thus, the project activity fulfills all the applicability criteria of the simplified small scale
methodology AMS-I.D./ Version 1414.",377,377_vcs_pd_11.60_mw_bundled_wind_power_project_in_tamil_nadu.pdf,methodology,{'project_methodologies': ['AMS-I.D.']},What is the methodology of this project?,{'project_methodologies': ['AMS-I.D.']}

2.2 Applicability of Methodology
The proposed activity is utilization of biomass (rice husk) for steam and power generation required for
various processes at the processing unit. Additionally, this is a small-scale project activity as the thermal
output is (39.71 MWthermal) less than 45 MWthermal (pls. refer Appendix-3 for details). Hence, it qualifies
for the category IC.
The proposed CDM project activity falls under the Type I and Category C, thus, the position of the CDM
project activity vis-à-vis applicability conditions in the AMS-I.C version 20 is described in the following table.
This methodology comprises renewable energy technologies that supply individual households or users with
thermal energy that displaces fossil fuels under the following conditions:

why it is applicable to the project activity:
The methodology applied is Category AMS-I.E: Switch from Non–Renewable
Biomass for Thermal Applications by the User – Version 01 from February 01 of
2008 onwards which is applicable for project activities that avoid greenhouse
gas emissions by using renewable biomass in order to generate thermal energy.
This category comprises small thermal appliances that displace the use of
non-renewable biomass by introducing new renewable energy end-user
technologies. The end-user technology in the case of this project can be
established as the project proponent, who utilizes the thermal energy
generated by the new renewable energy technology.
There are no similar registered small-scale CDM project activities in the
region of Presidente Prudente once Social Carbon Company made a research and
did not find any registered small–scale CDM Project activity in the region.
The sources of registered small-scale CDM project activity consulted were the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 14 and
Brazilian’s Technology and Science Ministry15. Therefore, the proposed project
activity is not saving the non-renewable biomass accounted by the other
registered project activities.
The utilization of firewood from area without any kind of management can not
be considered a renewable source of biomass, since it involves a decrease of
carbon pools and increases the carbon emissions to the atmosphere, turning
green house effect even worse. Moreover, the native wood provided from areas
without a reforestation management plan does not fit any of the options of
UNFCCC definition of renewable biomass in Annex 18, EB 23.
Furthermore, firewood has been used for many decades as fuel in Brazil16.
Although, it is impossible to define a start date on which this kind of non-
renewable biomass began to be applied, there are many documents to prove that
wood has been used for thermal energy generation before 1989 as requested in
the applied methodology. Firewood used to be the most employed source of
primary energy until de decade of 1970, when the petroleum started to supply

the majority of Brazilian’s energy needs17. Moreover the Brazilian’s Energy
and Mine Ministry has been monitoring every energetic sectors of Brazil since
1970, and firewood appears over the years monitored as a significant source
of thermal energy for ceramic sector18. Especially in the ceramic sector, the
use of firewood is visible non-renewable and unsustainable, involving
negative environmental impacts associated19.
This way, it can be concluded that non-renewable biomass has been used since
31 December 1989.
The biomasses utilized in the project, sawdust and sugar cane bagasse, are
common residue in the region generated.
Sawdust, wood chips, peanut shells and sugar cane bagasse are all industries
residues coming from large scale reforestation or agroindustrial projects, so
it is considered renewable according to option V of methodology definition of
renewable biomass: “The biomass is the non-fossil fraction of an industrial
or municipal waste”.
The elephant grass is considered renewable according to option III, as soon
as it fits all the assumptions below:
“The biomass is non-woody biomass and originates from croplands and/or
grasslands where:
(a) The land area remains cropland and/or grasslands or is reverted to
forest; and
(b) Sustainable management practices are undertaken on these land areas to
ensure in particular that the level of carbon stocks on these land areas does
not systematically decrease over time (carbon stocks may temporarily decrease
due to harvesting); and
(c) Any national or regional forestry, agriculture and nature conservation
regulations are complied with.”
Moreover, the project activity will annually generate less than 45 MWThermal.",52,52_proj_desc_52_11may2009.pdf,sector,{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'},"What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?",{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}

generation (Version 13, EB 36)
The technology used in the project activity is Enercon’s gearless technology which is
environmentally safe and sound and no GHG emissions are associated with the electricity
generation. No technology transfer is involved in this project activity. Gearless technology is
more efficient to convert wind energy in to electrical energy. In the conventional wind turbines
gearbox consist of multiple wheels and bearings which suffers tremendous stress because of
wind turbulence. Small defect in any component can bring the turbine to halt, this makes the
gearbox most high-maintenance part of a turbine. In gearless technology magnets spin around a
coil to produce current and gives maximum efficiency.

Leakage Management
Although there is a risk of leakage, the proponents believe that the project activity will have
positive impacts on surrounding areas. This project activity might be a successful benchmark of
the following technical and economic aspects:
I. Sustainable management of forest resources generating success and profit;
II. Additional return to forest management, thanks to REDD incentives, which can
compensate avoiding deforestation for other activities;
III. Positive example of sustainable real estate maintenance, in addition to profits
with sustainable management plus REDD revenues.
In this context, the project may well stimulate other landowners to adhere to this project
concept.
Leakage Management Plan

Project Description: VCS Version 4.2
By means of Project monitoring activities, satellite imaging, and social and governmental
cooperation for monitoring the project and its surroundings, the project proponent believes that
the success of this business plan will generate an increased number of sustainably managed
areas with REDD+. This Leakage Management plan will be based on the monitoring parameters,
in addition to being verified in every SocialCarbon Report.
The main leakage management activities are outlined below:
• Surveillance activities designed to mitigate illegal logging and land occupation in the area
will be achieved through the project activity. This process will be further consolidated
through combined efforts with private and governmental entities, and NGOs.
• Inclusion of new instances: further areas with potential for REDD+ projects have already
been identified around the project site, which will complement financial incentives
obtained from credit sales and provide more social and environmental benefits to local
communities.
Combatting illegal land occupation: the local community will be strategic in monitoring illegal
land occupation and potential illegal logging. Those who are interested in being trained and
carrying out local monitoring will be included in the project, an activity which may also become
a new source of income for local communities.

2.1 No Net Harm
Xingu-Araguaia Grouped REDD+ Project has conducted a social and environmental assessment
within the Leakage Management Area. The performance of the socio-environmental diagnosis
and in-site consultation with local stakeholders will happen during the project's validation. In
addition, literature research was also performed to enhance information collected during the
onsite visit that were vague or incomplete.
In addition to the acknowledgment of the socioenvironmental conditions of the communities, the
SOCIALCARBON certifications also may be applied to quantify the main potential environmental
and socio-economic risks. The applicable SOCIALCARBON indicators for this grouped project are

the Kebeles was conducted in the presence of community leaders, nominated committees and
government bodies. Six Kebeles were identified to fall within the project site.
Finally, it was concluded that, frequent meetings and discussions with the local communities including
illegal settlers in the gulley area should continue in order to reach a consensus. Additionally, it was
recommended that relevant offices should be willing to offer any kind of support to the implementing
organizations.115
iv. Stakeholder consultations with the local communities
In an open discussion, community consultation, a consensus was reached to form legal cooperatives in
each of the six Kebeles to manage the proposed regeneration area and adopt bylaws and internal laws to
manage the project. Formation of the cooperatives will make acquisition of the land use right certificates
from the Woreda Rural and Environmental protection offices possible. As such, the communities will be
granted user rights and the right to carbon credit sale. ANCEDA, the implementing entity will sign a
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the cooperatives over the right to carbon credits and other
related activities. Conversely, ANCEDA will sign an agreement with HOAREC&N over the sale of carbon
right.
Additionally, as a result of project expansion in the N-E side, a community consultation was undertaken
with the pastoralists who live outside the project site, but utilize the project area as a grazing land for their
cattle. This was due to their displacement as a result of implementation of the project, as they would lose
their grazing lands and; consequently, their livelihoods which would result in possible leakage problems.
The pastoralist community expressed their commitment to tackle any activities that would damage forest
resources. They agreed to graze their cattle out of the project area utilizing the cut and carry system to
reduce degradation in the project area. Additionally, they agreed to use crop residue to feed their
livestock. Conversely, HOAREC&N agreed to support the pastoralists with fodder and forage seeds to
grow in their lands for continued use. Moreover, as a lasting solution, the Zone Livestock and Land
Administration offices agreed to teach the community on the importance of having few, high breed cattle
instead of many, less productive cattle.
v. Stakeholder consultations during PRA116
During the PRA, which was conducted between 24 to 28 June 2014, the communities reported some of
the activities within the project area that have resulted in the degradation of the forest mountain slopes.
These activities included overgrazing, human induced forest fires (started by hunters and grass
collectors), unsustainable harvesting of forest resources for personal use and sale and timber for
construction materials.

116 Ibid
v3.2 115

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
The PRA also revealed that the implementation of the project would result in the displacement of
pastoralists who settle temporarily within the project site during the heavy rainy season (June –
September) to graze their cattle on the grasslands. The pastoralists would be forced to migrate to other
nearby places to access grazing lands (including the government grazing land through payment), buy
fodder and use crop residue from their lands, reduce their livestock numbers, or keep their cattle around
the homesteads during summer. Nonetheless, as a lasting solution, the Zone Livestock and Land
Administration offices agreed to teach the community on the importance of having few, high breed cattle
instead of many, less productive cattle.
Furthermore, the community presented that, despite these challenges, regeneration of the mountain
slopes will generate significant environmental benefits including improved air quality, water quality and
quantity, reduced soil erosion and; hence, improved soil conditions, as well as increased biological
diversity. The income generation for local communities will also improve through creation of diversified
sources of income from honey production, ecotourism, utilization of non-timber forest products, and
revenues from carbon finance. This will enhance the livelihoods of these poor, local communities.
Averting environmental degradation and mitigating climate change impacts will consequently help in
eradicating poverty.117
vi. Feasibility Study
A feasibility study was undertaken between 24 June and July 20 2014 by a consultant contracted by
HOAREC&N. The feasibility study involved an assessment of the potential environmental and socio-
economic impacts of the project.
Stakeholder consultations were carried out with the relevant individuals and groups including face-to-face
interviews with officials and experts. In addition, two focus group discussions were undertaken with
community representatives.
The focus group discussions established that there has been ongoing degradation of the project site as a
consequence of anthropogenic activities. The main drivers of deforestation established included firewood
collection; overgrazing and agricultural activities. The agents of deforestation included members of local
communities. The degradation of the mountain forests has resulted in recurrent drought, soil degradation,
shortage of livestock feed, declining crop/livestock productivity, as well as water shortages in the local
communities.
In addition, the consultant provided that, there is an opportunity to enhance water availability as well as
ecosystem regeneration through reducing vegetation and unsustainable land use practices in the area.
As a consequence, various mitigation measures were proposed for this project which included
afforestation of degraded forest areas, introduction and popularization of improved cooking mechanisms,
as well as improved agroforestry technologies.
The stakeholder consultations also revealed that, there are risks and threats that may hamper the
success of the project, for instance, the prevalent degradation of the soil and poor soil condition as a
result of poor soil fertility and depth. Another major challenge established was finding an alternative
grazing ground for the large livestock population in the area since this could hamper regeneration of
vegetation through grazing and trampling effects. Other challenges included management failures and
financial failures. Furthermore, due to the substantial dependence of the local communities to the
mountain forests, they suggested several livelihood options to reduce pressure on the forest. These

encompassed beekeeping, ecotourism, poultry farming, fishery, use of energy efficient cook stoves, and
utilization of the cut and carry system for their livestock.
The major stakeholders identified were farmers who are organized in Community Forest Management
Groups (CFMGs) aimed at enhancing the rehabilitation and enrichment of the project sites. However, it
was noted that, the project presents opportunities for disputes as a result of excluding farmers who are
not members of the CFMGs and; consequently have no forest rights of use.
On the management practices, it was found that, there have been limited interventions to rehabilitate the
forest areas, but since the inception of the project, community mobilization for integrated watershed
management and awareness creation have been the main intervention focus areas for the last three
years. Due to this, it was observed that there has been natural regeneration of many species in the
project areas due to community attitudinal change.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
APPENDIX 1: BASELINE BIOMASS SURVEY
The first goal of the baseline biomass survey is to define the land that is eligible for an ARR project, i.e.
areas classified as non-forest. A Land Use Land Cover (LULC) map has been generated from satellite
information available.
The second target is to determine the baseline carbon stocks in the Instance Area (eligible areas) within
the Instance Zone, which are necessary in order to define the starting point from the carbon stocks
perspective. Since VHR satellite imagery was available for a period close to the start date, this has been
used to estimate the crown cover which in turn has been used to determine the baseline carbon stock
through the application of the techniques prescribed in the applicable tool.
The same points will be interpreted for trees and shrubs, therefore giving an estimate of proportion of
points in each clusters that overlay on trees or shrubs. It is not expected that a point will overlay on both
trees and shrubs.
Hereunder an example of a cluster and of interpretation. In yellow those points where a Shrub was
detected, in blue those points with bareland or grassland. No trees were identified.

A total of 606.95 MW capacity was installed in the regime 2,3 and 4 out of which 470.8 MW
is under various stages of CDM/VCS registration and are publicly available. This clearly
establishes that diffusion of similar project activities (without carbon revenues) in the relevant
region is insignificant.
Sub step 4(b) ‘Discuss any similar options that are occurring’
In accordance with 4(b) of the additionality tool
“If similar activities are widely observed and commonly carried out, it calls into question the
claim that the proposed project activity is financially unattractive (as contended in Step 2) or
faces barriers (as contended in Step 3). Therefore, if similar activities are identified above,
then it is necessary to demonstrate why the existence of these activities does not contradict the
claim that the proposed project activity is financially/economically unattractive or subject to
barriers.”
In total of 606.95 was installed in the regimes 2,3 and 4 out of which 470.8 MW is in carbon
credit pipeline (i.e. more than 77% of the capacity of the capacity is envisaged with carbon
revenues). We have traced 470.8 MW that are envisaged considering carbon revenues. The
data for balance capacity of 136 MW is not traceable as most of the information such as
Purchase orders, loan documents, Debt Equity ratio, carbon transaction in VCS/CCX markets
etc required making the distinction between the projects are confidential and are not available
in public domain.
The diffusion of similar project activities (without carbon revenues) in the relevant region is
insignificant and is not present in the carbon credit pipeline. This further strengthens the
argument that wind power development in Karnataka is significantly dependent on carbon
credits and is not a common practice.

1520,methodology,"3.2 Applicability of Methodology
For the methodology “AR-ACM0003: Afforestation and reforestation of lands except wetlands
(Version 2.0)” relevant applicability conditions are fulfilled as follows:
(a) The land subject to the project activity does not fall in wetland category:
The lands that are subject to this project activity have suffered severely from the adverse effects
of climate change including drought, heavy rainfall and erosion, which have ultimately resulted in
their degraded status. The project undertakes a rigorous process of identifying wetlands, wet
soils, or swamps, and excludes them from areas that are subject to the project activities,
including any tree planting activities. This procedure ensures that the areas subject to the project
activity do not fall within the wetland category. An additional geospatial analysis done by
overlaying the project areas over the FAO soil classes3 further confirms that the areas do not fall
in wetlands/wet soil categories (which are Gleysols or Plinthosols) but are predominantly
characterized by dystric Nitisols and ferric Luvisols (see Figure 11).
3 Soil classes from FAO Digital Soil Map of the World, accessed here.

Project Description: VCS Version 4.2
Figure 11: Soil types in the project region
(b) Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10 percent of
area in each of the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project
boundary:
(i) Land containing organic soils;
(ii) Land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and
receives inputs listed in appendices 2 and 3 to the methodology.
The project area is characterized by degraded soils, which do not fall within the land types
specified in point (i) and (ii). Consequently, the restriction regarding soil disturbance is not
applicable to the project. As per Appendix 2 of the methodology, grasslands in tropical moist
areas would only be subject to the restrictions if they are moderately degraded and receive high
inputs, which does not apply to the project area. In most cases, the barren land has remained
unused for decades, indicating a lack of recent human intervention or manure input.
Soil disturbance attributable to the project is principally for digging the planting pits and spot-
hoeing (weeding around the planted trees). Overall, soil disturbance within the project area is
43

Project Description: VCS Version 4.2
estimated at most to be 3% of the total area. This is derived if one assumes universal plant
spacing of 3 m x 3 m (as in the planting scheme in Figure 4), with a pit of width of 1 foot radius,
which is used for planting and spot-hoeing (manual weeding around the plants/planting pit/hole).
A spatial analysis confirms, that even if soil disturbance outside the project boundaries was
considered and included the cattle trenches, the area affected by soil disturbances would still
not exceed 9.5 per cent (see Figure 12).
Therefore, as stated above, soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover
more than 10 per cent of area – even if the area had organic soils or was subject to the type of
land-use, management practices and inputs listed in appendices 2 of the applied methodology.

The baseline scenario of the proposed project is total atmospheric release of the gas (see section
B.4) and the captured gas is used to produce energy. Thus, the VER project activity corresponds
to ACM0001 Flaring or use of landfill gas Version 19.0, is applicable to the project activity.
Applicability of “Project emissions from flaring” Version 04.0
In line with ACM0001 “Flaring or Use of Landfill Gas” version 19.0.0”, the project activity is
eligible to claim emission reductions from its flaring activities. Within the project activity, there is
an enclosed flare system installed to flare any excess of LFG. However, the project participant
opts to exclude the flare system from the project boundary and will not claim any emission
reductions from the flaring activities (if any) within the crediting period, since the flare system is
observed/envisaged to work none or for insignificant durations throughout the operational
lifetime.
Applicability of “Emissions from solid waste disposal sites"" Version 08.0
The tool provides procedures to calculate baseline, project or leakage emissions of methane from
solid waste disposed or prevented from disposal at a solid waste disposal site (SWDS). The tool
is applicable as the solid waste disposal site where the waste would be dumped can be clearly
identified and the proposed project is not a stockpile, and no hazardous waste is processed.
The applicability of the tool is discussed as follows:

1526,sector,"3.2 Monitoring, including estimation, modelling, measurement or calculation approaches
The purpose of the monitoring performed is to determine the net amount of GHG emission
reductions generated by the project activity through avoidance of landfill methane emissions
and avoidance of emissions associated with displaced fossil-based grid electricity generation.
Baseline emissions associated with landfill methane are modelled by measuring the amount of
steam generated by the Project activity, which is used to calculate the amount of waste
combusted by the Project activity. The amount of waste combusted represents the waste that
would have been landfilled in the absence of the Project activity. Total Facility waste processed
is determined from waste received, corrected for waste inventory in the storage pit. Waste
received is determined with truck scales, which are operated and maintained by the County,
tested and calibrated at least semi-annually, and used by the County for billing purposes. The
amount of waste processed by the Project activity is determined by prorating the total Facility
waste processed by the steam generation by unit. Each of the units are of similar design and
operate at the same pressure and consequently have comparable efficiencies. Each boiler is
fed from the same pit; therefore, the fuel is consistent between the four units.
Baseline emissions associated with displaced fossil based grid electrical generation are
calculated by measuring the net electrical generation from Turbine Generator #2 (TG2) which is
dedicated to the Project activity (Unit #4). The net electrical generation reflects the actual
electricity delivered to the grid. Parasitic loads (e.g. feedwater pumps, air compressors) of the
Facility are not included in the net generation. Facility meters that measure electrical output to
the grid are verified against the State Rd 60 switchyard meter which is used for revenue
purposes and is owned by the utility.
During the first two months of the Project operation (August and September), Unit #4 net
electrical output was not measured by the distributed control system (DCS). For these two
months, net generation from TG2 was prorated based on the gross from each of the two turbine
generators.
Project emissions are calculated from data obtained by monitoring the total steam generation,
natural gas consumption as an auxiliary fuel, diesel consumption for heavy equipment used to
manage the waste brought into the facility, purchased grid electricity, and the fossil-based
fraction of total stack CO . Beginning with the 2011 emissions year, after U.S. EPA regulations 2
requiring stack monitoring of CO emissions from municipal waste combustors sized at 600 tons 2
per day or above go into effect, project emissions of CO will be measured using a continuous 2
emission rate monitoring system (CERMS). Project nitrous oxide (N O) and methane (CH ) 2 4

emissions are calculated based on the total tons of waste processed by the project activity.
Natural gas consumption is based on the Project boiler gas meter. Each boiler at the Facility
has a gas meter. Total gas consumption as measured by billing meter is then allocated
between the boilers, including the Project boiler.
Diesel consumption is determined from purchase records. For GHG emission calculation
purposes, diesel purchases are adjusted at the end and beginning of the year (or partial year to
reflect Project operation in 2009) as needed so a full year, or the relevant Project operation
period, is reflected. Tank inventories are not taken at the beginning and end of the year.
Relative to annual diesel consumption, tank capacities are small (~500 gal. for mobile
equipment, 250 gal. for fire pump) and do not have a potential to generate significant errors in
diesel consumption as predicted by purchases. Diesel consumption is not specifically tracked
by unit. Therefore, in order to estimate the diesel consumed in support of the Project activity,
total diesel consumption is prorated by the tons processed by Unit #4. Given that diesel is
predominately used to handle MSW on the tipping floor, diesel consumption by boiler is
proportional to MSW processed per unit.
Rarely, during complete facility black outages, power is purchased from the grid and billed by
the utility. Purchased electricity is prorated based on steam generation by unit.
When data, except for diesel consumption, is prorated, the proration is performed monthly.
Diesel fuel is prorated on an annual basis. For the year 2009, only data from July to December
is considered to align with the project start date.
The type of information reported is outlined in Table 8 below. Actual reported data for 2009 is
included in Appendix B. Calculation equations and explanations for both baseline and project
emissions is provided in Section 4.

16 A capacity addition is an increase in the installed power generation capacity of an existing power plant
through: (i) The installation of a new power plant besides the existing power plant/units; or (ii) The
installation of new power units, additional to the existing power plant/units. The existing power
plant/units continue to operate after the implementation of the project activity.
17 Retrofit (or rehabilitation or refurbishment). It involves an investment to repair or modify an existing
power plant/unit, with the purpose to increase the efficiency, performance or power generation capacity
of the plant, without adding new power plants or units, or to resume the operation of closed
(mothballed) power plants. A retrofit restores the installed power generation capacity to or above its
original level. Retrofits shall only include measures that involve capital investments and not regular
maintenance or housekeeping measures.
18 Replacement. It involves investment in a new power plant or unit that replaces one or several existing
unit(s) at the existing power plant. The installed capacity of the new plant or unit is equal to or higher
than the plant or unit that was replaced.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
20 A reservoir is to be considered as an “existing reservoir” if it has been in operation for at least three
years before the implementation of the project activity.
21 A co-fired system uses both fossil and renewable fuels, for example the simultaneous combustion of
both biomass residues and fossil fuels in a single boiler. Fossil fuel may be used during a period of
time when the biomass is not available and due justifications are provided.
22 Physically distinct units are those that are capable of generating electricity without the operation of
existing units, and that do not directly affect the mechanical, thermal, or electrical characteristics of the
existing facility. For example, the addition of a steam turbine to an existing combustion turbine to create
a combined cycle unit would not be considered “physically distinct”.

1537,sector,"2.1.10 Sectoral Scope and Project Type
The project corresponds to VCS Sectoral Scope 14: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)
in the category of REDD Avoided Unplanned Deforestation and Degradation (AUDD). The project will use
a programmatic approach (grouped project).

Forests of the project area have become important areas for conservation (Solano et al., 2005). Although
these are strategic ecosystems in the provision of environmental services, they are surrounded by a
mosaic of pasturelands and thus have become highly fragmented and threatened with the expansion of
the agricultural frontier. To continue supporting both production and conservation on these lands,
adaptation strategies and alternatives to current regional production systems must be sought to both
integrate the sustainable use of natural resources and allow for the connectivity of strategic ecosystems.
In keeping with the REDD+ approach of examining the direct relationship between human activities,
deforestation, and forest degradation, a series of project activities has been proposed to reduce the
aforementioned threats on the forests in the project zone and mitigate the associated GHG emissions. In
parallel, the project activities described in this section seek to: (i) promote sustainable economic activities
that positively impact the local community while reducing the impact of production on forests, (ii) integrate
land management into the socioeconomic and political climate, and (iii) fortify management, governance,
and technical capacities to ensure the efficient implementation of the REDD+ project.
The development of the following series of project activities has been proposed after having carefully
accounted for the ideas and the wealth of accumulated knowledge particular to the project zone. Among
the considered information were: a socioeconomic evaluation of the study area (reported from official
sources such as the “Scheme for Land Management” and the “Municipal Development Plans”), the
Management Plan of the Regional Integrated Management District (DRMI) of the paramos of “Guantiva
and La Rusia oak forests and surrounding lands,” an assessment of agents and drivers of deforestation
and degradation, input from the community, and the expertise of those with institutional and community
experience in the implementation of sustainable production activities.
The project is not located within a jurisdiction covered by a jurisdictional REDD+ program49. Due to
restricted financial capacity, the project activities have been prioritized into two distinct groups to ensure
effective implementation by Fundación Natura:
Project Activities – Priority:
1. Sustainable Cattle Ranching Model
2. Forest Restoration and Development of Protection-Production Arrangements
3. Firewood “Banks”
4. Family Gardens
49 Colombia has divided the country in five regions: Pacific, Amazon, Andean, Orinoquia and Caribbean. The two
priority regions identified for potential REDD+ programs are the Amazon and the Pacific, as they contain the majority
of the country’s forest. The project area is not covered by a jurisdictional REDD+ program. Source: Readiness

2.1.9 ProjectOwnership (VCS, 3.2, 3.7, 3.10;CCB, G5.8)
According to Article 4 of the Land Management Law of China17, there are three legal
categories of land in China based on their using purpose: agricultural land, construction land
and unused land. For instance, the ""agricultural land"" refers to the land used for agricultural
production, including cultivated land, forest land, grassland, land for irrigation, water surface
for breeding, etc. All these three categories of lands must be used in accordance with their
land utilization purpose defined in General Land Utilization Plan approved by government. It
isstrictly forbidden forany individuals or entitiesto change the utilization purposeof any land.
According to the Article 10 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China18 and the
Articles 9&11 of the Land Management Law of the people’s Republic of China, the
title/ownership to land of above three land categories belongs to the state or the village
collectives which is a non-transferable right, and if the title/ownership to land belongs to the
state, the utilization/tenure/management rights to land can be transferred in accordance with
law, and if the title/ownership to land belongs to the village collectives, the
utilization/tenure/management rights to land also belong to the village collectives and can be
transferredin accordancewith law.
The PP Beijing Qianyuhui Environmental Technology Co., Ltd has been authorized the land
use/tenure/management rights by Aksai Kazakh Autonomous County People's Government.
Thus, the project ownership belongs to PPBeijing Qianyuhui EnvironmentalTechnology Co.,

The consolidated methodology (ACM0012, Version 04.0) is for the following type of project
activities:
The consolidated methodology is applicable to project activities implemented in an existing or
Greenfield facility converting waste energy carried in identified Waste Energy Carrying
Medium (here after WECM) stream(s) into useful energy. The WECM stream may be an
energy source for:
 Generation of electricity;
 Cogeneration;
 Direct use as process heat source;

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
 Generation of heat in element process;
 Generation of mechanical energy; or
 Supply of heat of reaction with or without process heating.
This project is a cogeneration project using waste gas from Hyundai steel mill, so the
proposed project complies with the Methodology.
In the absence of the project activity, the WECM stream:
(a) Would not be recovered and therefore would be flared, released to atmosphere, or remain
unutilized in the absence of the project activity at the existing or Greenfield project facility; or
(b) Would be partially recovered, and the unrecovered portion of WECM stream would be
flared, vented, or remained unutilized at the existing or Greenfield project facility.
For the proposed project, the WECM produced by the proposed project are divided into 2
parts. One of them will be used to inner use of Hyundai Steel in spite of either the proposed
project will be implement or not, after Hyundai steel mill reaches the maximum inner usage of
WECM, the left part of WECM is going to apply to the proposed project. In the absence of the
project activity, the WECM stream used in the proposed project would not be recovered and
will be vented after incineration.

According to Appendix 1, eligible ARR activities are those that increase carbon sequestration
and/or reduce GHG emissions by establishing, increasing or restoring vegetative cover (forest or
non-forest) through the planting, sowing or human-assisted natural regeneration of woody
vegetation. Eligible ARR projects may include timber harvesting in their management plan. The
project area shall not be cleared of native ecosystems within the 10-year period prior to the

The project aims to increase carbon sequestration by establishing forest cover with trees and
shrubs through the planting and continued forest management. The lands in the project area
belonged to degraded lands with little vegetation, as described in Section 2.2.1. There was no
forest in the project area before the project implementation. The project area was not cleared of
nativeecosystems withinthe 10-year period prior tothe project start date. Therefore, theproject

2.1 Project Goals, DesignandLong-Term Viability
2.1.1 SummaryDescriptionoftheProject(G1.2)
Damao Banner Sustainable Grassland Management Project (hereafter as “the project”) is located in
Darhan Muminggan Joint Banner (“Damao Banner” for short), Baotou City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region of China. The project is aimed to restore the local degraded grassland ecosystem from adoption
of sustainable grassland management practices, such as improving the rotation of grazing animals
between summer and winter pastures, limiting the timing and number of grazing animals on degraded
pastures, and restoration of severely degraded land by replanting with perennial grasses and ensuring
appropriate management over the long-term. The project proponent is Damao Banner Eco-Construction
InvestmentCo., Ltd..
According to the baseline survey, before the implementation of the project, the grassland in the region
has been facing serious degradation and even desertification due to the impact of climate change and
humanactivities.
Totally, 125,441.81 ha of degraded grassland has been managed scientifically by including by fence
building and reseeding of native species grass. There are three mainrestoration measuresas followed in
theproject:
Rest grazing and rotational grazing are implemented in moderate degraded area where total grass yield
decreased by 21%-50% compared with the non-degraded grassland as per Parameters for Degradation,
SandificationandSalificationofRangelands(GB19377-2003).
Rotational grazing requires that the grazing time shall be reduced by dividing grasslands into seasonal
grazing land according to the livestock carrying capacity of the grassland by fence building. Then based
on specified grazing order, grazing cycle and zoning grazing time, the grassland is grazed area by area
and used in turn. 40,302.06ha of degraded grassland has been managed sustainably by the
implementationofrotationalgrazing.
Rest grazing is also implemented in moderately degraded areas and requires that grazing shall not be
carried out within 90days when the grass turns green (05-April to 20-May) and the seeds are in
the productive phase (15-August to 30-September) every year by building the fence. 47,469.55ha of
degradedgrasslandhavebeenmanagedscientificallybytheimplementationofrestgrazing.
Reseeding the grassland was implemented in seriously degraded grasslands where total grass
decreased by more than 50% compared with the non-degraded grassland as per GB19377-2003. Total
37,673.2ha of degraded grassland have been reseed to restore the grassland productivity. Native grass
species including Avena sativa L, Elymus dahuricus Turcz, Agropyron, Elymus nutans and Secale
cereale L were for seeding based on the soil and climate conditions in the project area. After reseeding
the grass, the project area needs to be fenced for 3 years to prohibit grazing in order to better restore
grassland vegetation. Then under the premise of not affecting the normal growth of the improved
grassland, the grassland should be used reasonably and sustainably according to the local approved
livestockcarryingcapacity.
The project is estimated to generate GHG emission removals of 13,168,508tCO e in 40 years, with an 2
averageannualGHGemissionremovalof329,213tCO e. 2

1564,methodology,"3.2 Applicability of Methodology
For the methodology “AR-ACM0003: Afforestation and reforestation of lands except wetlands
(Version 2.0)” applicability conditions apply and are fulfilled as follows:
a) The land subject to the project activity does not fall in wetland category:
The project focuses on lands that have been severely impacted by climate change, experiencing
issues such as drought, excessive rainfall, and erosion, leading to their current degraded
condition. To ensure environmental integrity, the project employs a meticulous process to identify
and exclude wetlands, marshy soils, and swamps from its scope of activities. This approach
guarantees that the project does not interfere with wetland ecosystems. Further validation is
provided through geospatial analysis, which overlays the project zones onto soil classifications.
This analysis confirms that the targeted areas are not wetlands or wet soils (Gleysols) or organic
soils (Histosols) but are primarily composed of Luvisols and Acrisols as can be seen in Figure 13
Figure 13 Soils present in the project area

Instead, they\nsupport/comply with all\nrelevant laws (see section\n1.14).\nb) The tool is required by\ntheAR-ACM0003\nMethodology'], ['“Estimation of carbon\nstocks and change in\ncarbon stocks of trees\nand shrubs in A/R CDM\nproject activities” (Version\n04.2)', 'The tool has no internal applicability\nconditions', 'Not applicable']]
Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.2
b) Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10 percent of area
in each of the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project
boundary: (i) Land containing organic soils; (ii) Land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-
use and management practices and receives inputs listed in appendices 2 and 3 to the
methodology.
The project zone features soils that are in a degraded state and do not align with the land
categories outlined in points (i) and (ii). As a result, the limitations concerning soil disturbance
are not applicable to this project. In general, in this project, soil disturbance is only associated
with digging the planting pits and spot-hoeing (manual weeding around the planted trees/
planting pit/ hole) which is estimated at most to be 3% of the total area. This is derived if one
assumes universal plant spacing of 3 m x 3 m (as in the planting scheme in Figure 4), with a pit
of width of 1 foot radius (see Figure 16), which is used for planting and spot-hoeing. A spatial
analysis confirms that even if soil disturbance outside the project boundaries was considered
and thus included the cattle trenches, the area affected by soil disturbances would still not
exceed 9.5 per cent.
In addition to methodological requirements, for the tools applied, applicability conditions are
fulfilled as shown in Table 7.

1582,methodology,"2.2 Justification of the choice of the methodology and
why it is applicable to the project activity:
The methodology applied is Category AMS-I.E: Switch from Non–Renewable
Biomass for Thermal Applications by the User – Version 01 from February 01 of
2008 onwards which is applicable for project activities that avoid greenhouse
gas emissions by using renewable biomass in order to generate thermal energy.
This category comprises small thermal appliances that displace the use of
non-renewable biomass by introducing new renewable energy end-user
technologies. The end-user technology in the case of this project can be
established as the project proponent, who utilizes the thermal energy
generated by the new renewable energy technology.
There are no similar registered small-scale CDM project activities in the
region of Presidente Prudente once Social Carbon Company made a research and
did not find any registered small–scale CDM Project activity in the region.
The sources of registered small-scale CDM project activity consulted were the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 14 and
Brazilian’s Technology and Science Ministry15. Therefore, the proposed project
activity is not saving the non-renewable biomass accounted by the other
registered project activities.
The utilization of firewood from area without any kind of management can not
be considered a renewable source of biomass, since it involves a decrease of
carbon pools and increases the carbon emissions to the atmosphere, turning
green house effect even worse. Moreover, the native wood provided from areas
without a reforestation management plan does not fit any of the options of
UNFCCC definition of renewable biomass in Annex 18, EB 23.
Furthermore, firewood has been used for many decades as fuel in Brazil16.
Although, it is impossible to define a start date on which this kind of non-
renewable biomass began to be applied, there are many documents to prove that
wood has been used for thermal energy generation before 1989 as requested in
the applied methodology. Firewood used to be the most employed source of
primary energy until de decade of 1970, when the petroleum started to supply

Nascente Ceramic VCS Project Description
the majority of Brazilian’s energy needs17. Moreover the Brazilian’s Energy
and Mine Ministry has been monitoring every energetic sectors of Brazil since
1970, and firewood appears over the years monitored as a significant source
of thermal energy for ceramic sector18. Especially in the ceramic sector, the
use of firewood is visible non-renewable and unsustainable, involving
negative environmental impacts associated19.
This way, it can be concluded that non-renewable biomass has been used since
31 December 1989.
The biomasses utilized in the project, sawdust and sugar cane bagasse, are
common residue in the region generated.
Sawdust, wood chips, peanut shells and sugar cane bagasse are all industries
residues coming from large scale reforestation or agroindustrial projects, so
it is considered renewable according to option V of methodology definition of
renewable biomass: “The biomass is the non-fossil fraction of an industrial
or municipal waste”.
The elephant grass is considered renewable according to option III, as soon
as it fits all the assumptions below:
“The biomass is non-woody biomass and originates from croplands and/or
grasslands where:
(a) The land area remains cropland and/or grasslands or is reverted to
forest; and
(b) Sustainable management practices are undertaken on these land areas to
ensure in particular that the level of carbon stocks on these land areas does
not systematically decrease over time (carbon stocks may temporarily decrease
due to harvesting); and
(c) Any national or regional forestry, agriculture and nature conservation
regulations are complied with.”

2.2 Applicability of Methodology
ACM0006 is applicable to project activities that operate biomass (co-)fired power-and-heat plants.
The project activity may include the following activities or, where applicable, combinations of
these activities:
· The installation of new plants at a site where currently no power and heat generation occurs
(Greenfield projects);
· The installation of new plants at a site where currently power or heat generation occurs. The
new plant replaces or is operated next to existing plants (capacity expansion projects);
· The improvement of energy efficiency of existing plants (energy efficiency improvement
projects), which can also lead to a capacity expansion, e.g. by retrofitting the existing plant;
· The total or partial replacement of fossil fuels by biomass in existing plants or in new plants that
would have been built in the absence of the project (fuel switch projects), e.g. by increasing the
share of biomass use as compared to the baseline, by retrofitting an existing plant to use
biomass, etc.
As described above, the project activity includes the installation of a new cogeneration power
plant firing biomass residues mainly from maize stalk. In addition, the Project is an independent
plant supplied by biomass residues coming from nearby areas where no power and heat
generation occurs. Therefore, the Project is defined to be a Greenfield project.
According to the Feasibility Study Report of the Project, the project meets all applicability
conditions of ACM0006 as follows:

Purpose:
The purpose of the wind-mills set up by the project activity is as follows:
• Generating clean power by utilising the renewable natural resource i.e., wind
power and exporting the electricity generated to the grid. Hence the project activity
does not cause emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that would have otherwise
been caused by power generation by the combustion of non-renewable sources of
energy.
• Harnessing the wind power potential existing in India for power generation
that has not been exploited to its full potential till date
• Contribution to the industrial development of India by providing support in
terms of enhanced power availability
• Increasing the share of renewable energy directly in the regional electricity
grid and indirectly in the national electricity grid
• Contribution to the causes of fossil-fuel conservation and climate change
mitigation
• Contribution to nation towards energy security
• Independency on fossil fuels
• Saving in national revenue by avoiding import of fossil fuels
Contribution of the Project Activity to Sustainable Development:

Jinhui sustainable grassland management project (hereafter as “the project”) is located in Tianjun County,
Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (Haixi Prefecture), Qinghai Province of China. The
project is aimed to restore the local degraded grassland ecosystem and “black soil beach” through
sustainable grassland management practices, such as improving the rotation of grazing animals among
rotational grazing plots, limiting the timing and number of grazing animals on degraded pastures, and
reseeding with native grasses on severely degraded grassland and ensuring appropriate management over
the long-term, thereby increasing carbon sequestration, and promoting local development. The project
proponent is Tianjun County Jinhui State-owned Assets Investment Operation Co., Ltd.
According to Parameters for Degradation, Sandification and Salification of Rangelands (GB19377-2003),
moderate degraded areas refer to total grass yield decreased by 21%-50% compared with the non-
degraded grassland and the total grass yield decreased by 50% compared with that before degradation is
regarded as severely degraded grasslands. Based on the baseline survey, before the implementation of
the project, the grassland in the project were moderately or severely degraded due to overgrazing for the
past decades, rodents and pests, etc. Some grassland even degenerated into “black soil beach”, which is
the extreme degradation stage of grassland degradation, where native vegetation has almost disappeared
and the surface of the soil becomes bare.
Tianjun County is located at the southern foot of Qilian Mountains, an extremely important glacier and
water-conserving ecological function area in China. Qilian Mountains are known as ""China's wet island,
alpine water tower and solid reservoir"". And Qilian Mountains also are known as the Hexi Corridor, which
is an important part of the ancient Silk Road. It is a natural barrier to maintain the ecological balance of the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, to maintain the stability of the oasis in the Hexi Corridor and to guarantee the
ecological security of the northern region.
Totally, 297,781.30 ha of degraded grassland has been managed scientifically through rest and rotational
grazing by fence building and reseeding of native grass species.
Rest grazing and rotational grazing with fence building are implemented respectively in 106,803.78 ha and
96,575.76 ha of moderately degraded area according to the livestock carrying capacity of the grassland in
order to gradually restore grassland vegetation and reduce soil erosion. Rest grazing and system is in place
in the fenced pastures, in which grazing shall not be carried out within 90days when the grass turns green
(20-April to 20-July) every year and rotational grazing system in which grasslands are planned to be divided
into a number of rotational grazing plots, then grazed in a certain order, and used in turn.
Reseeding the grassland was implemented in seriously degraded grasslands and total 94,401.76 ha of
degraded grassland have been reseed to restore the grassland productivity. Suitable native grass species
including Poacrymophila cv.Qinghai,Elymus nutans, Festuca sinensiscv.Qinghai, Elymus sibiricus and
Puccinellia tenuiflora were selected for seeding based on the soil and climate conditions in the project area.
After reseeding the grass, the grassland was fenced off for improved management and grazing was strictly
prohibited in the first three years in order to ensure that the grassland vegetation can be rejuvenated in the
short term. Then under the premise of not affecting the normal growth of the improved grassland, the

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
The project area is located in the rural region of Tehuantepec in Oaxaca, Mexico, where agriculture
activities are carried out mainly for sorghum sale. The land and the surroundings of the project area are
natural with a small surface water body passing through the eastern adjacent areas, which grows during
rainy season. The nearest town of “Santo Domingo Ingenio” is located 2.7 km from the project
boundaries. The project area covers an extension of 617 hectares, in which only 4.5% are to be used for
construction. The land is owned and will remain under the ownership of the different parties for
agricultural and livestock pasture uses. No significant environmental or socio-economic effects will be
caused upon completion of construction and throughout the operational life of the wind farm. The project
is generating power to offset the combustion of thousands of tonnes of fossil fuels and, in doing so, will
help preserve non-renewable resources by promoting the exploitation and use of renewable resources
and technologies. Therefore, the proposed project activity is primarily implemented for power generation,
and not with the purpose to create GHG emissions and their subsequent reduction, removal or
destruction.

In the following applicability discussion, only ACM0012 requirements that apply to the project installation
design shall be discussed. Thus all requirements for different waste heat recovery modes or utilization
purposes other than in the project case (e.g. waste pressure utilization) are not further considered.
The project is applicable as respective applicability requirements set by ACM0012 are fulfilled:
(1) For project activities which recover waste pressure, the methodology is applicable where
waste pressure is used to generate electricity only and the electricity generated from waste
pressure is measurable;
This condition is not applicable. The project recovers and utilizes waste heat at an existing
facility for the generation of electricity, while in the absence of the project activity all waste
gas would continue to be released to the atmosphere. As it can be seen even from the
project title, this project recovers recover waste heat.
(2) Regulations do not require the project facility to recover and/or utilize the waste energy prior
to the implementation of the project activity;
There are no regulations that require the project facility to recover and/or utilize the waste
energy prior to the implementation of the project activity.
(3) The methodology is applicable to both Greenfield and existing waste energy generation
facilities. If the production capacity of the project facility is expanded as a result of the project
activity, the added production capacity must be treated as a Greenfield facility
There is no capacity expansion resulting from the project activity.
(4) Waste energy that is released under abnormal operation (for example, emergencies, shut
down) of the project facility shall not be included in the emission reduction calculations.
Waste energy that is released under abnormal operation of the project facility will not be
included in the emission reduction calculations. This will be ensured through monitoring as
discussed in Section 4 of this PD.
(5) Applicability conditions of the Tools (see section 2.1 above) are considered.",1457,1457_proj_desc_1457_10dec2015.pdf,methodology,{'project_methodologies': ['ACM0012']},What is the methodology of this project?,{'project_methodologies': ['ACM0012']}

Zhangjiakou Zhangbei County 2017 Afforestation Project (hereafter refer to as “the project”) is located in
Zhangbei county, Zhangjiakou City, Hebei Province of China. Hebei province is land locked and borders
Inner Mongolia to the northwest, Shanxi to the southwest, Liaoning to the east and Henan to the north. The
population of the province is 75.56 million. The project aims to plant native species on suitable land for
forest with low vegetative coverage rate for GHG removal whilst contributing to local sustainable
development goals.
20,750 ha (311,250Mu13) of the forest was planted on suitable lands for forest with low vegetative coverage
rate in Zhangbei county, which used to be poor sustainable ecological environment and rocky desertification.
Prior to the project, although the project area is suitable for planting trees, it lacks proper forestry
management, resulting in lower coverage of trees. Besides, there has never been any activity affecting the
local ecosystem in the project area14. By checking the afforestation plan, it was confirmed that, a small
number of trees existed in some project area before the project started, but the coverage rate was extremely
low. So, considering the lower forest coverage, Zhangbei Forestry Bureau determined that the project area
is suitable for afforestation after investigation, then the supplementary planting without disturbing the
existing trees was approved to increase the vegetative cover. All the trees were planted without disturbing
the existing trees in this report, and only the trees actually planted in this project were monitored. The
carbon credit of the original trees in the baseline scenario will not be monitored or counted in the actual net
GHG removals by sink.
The project involves Zhangbei county, with a total population of nearly 370,000. All these lands for
afforestation activities belong to the village committees. Zhangjiakou Sailin Landscaping Co., Ltd. (hereafter
referred to as Sailin Company) has been fully authorized by Zhangbei government, who represents all the
village committees, through a signed contract to act as the project proponent to implement project
management and monitoring, and to sell VCUs generated from the project so that Sailin Company
consolidate the offset resources into sizeable forestry offset projects. The implementation of the project
activity has provided 11,265 jobs for local villagers, it includes 11,200 temporary planting jobs and 65 long-
term technician jobs, among which 60 percent are women. The employment period of temporary planting
workers was during the planting period of the project, from 12 May 2017 to 15 July 2017.

The project activity aims to:
- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate change;
- Enhance biodiversity conservation by increasing the connectivity of forests;
- Improve soil and water conservation in the mountainous region and increase the forest cover;
- Generate income and job opportunities for local communities.
There is no natural renewal and reforestation before the project, and all sites were suitable lands for forest
with low vegetative coverage rate. The main objective species is Pinus sylvestris15 (Mongolica) which is
native species according to the baseline survey.
The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to 3,900,753 tCO e 2
in 20 years from 12-May-2017 to 11-May-2037, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 195,038

3.2 Applicability of Methodology
The applicability conditions of the methodology “AR-ACM0003: Afforestation and reforestation
of lands except wetlands (Version 2)” are as follows:
(a) The land subject to the project activity does not fall in wetland category
As a guidance the official translation of FAO soil classes to IPCC soil classes is used, which is
referenced by Batjes (2010)45. The outer boundary of the project area is plotted against the Soil
maps as provided by the Universidad Nacional de Asunción, which provides the soil classes as
listed in table :
Table 6: Soil classes identified in the First Project Instances Trementina and San Liberato

By using the decision tree and the official translation of FAO soil classes to IPCC soil classes, which
is referenced by Batjes (2009)46. None of the project areas (inner boundary) belong to the category
of wetlands (FAO soil type Gleysol).
The land cover map produced by Sarvision (2022) shows that in both project areas there are
inundated savannah’s. Even though they are not based on Gleysols they have been excluded from
the project area.

(b) Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10 per cent of
area in each of the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project
boundary:
(i) Land containing organic soils;
(ii) land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and
receives inputs listed in appendices 1 and 2 to the methodology.
The project land does not contain organic soils (IPCC class ORG) as demonstrated above. The
project land does not receive any inputs according to appendices 1 and 2 of the AR
methodology (CDM).
Applicability conditions of the tool: “Demonstrating appropriateness of allometric equations for
estimation of aboveground tree biomass in A/R CDM project activities” (Version 01.0.0)
This tool has no internal applicability conditions
Applicability conditions of the tool: “Estimation of non-CO2 GHG emissions resulting from
burning of biomass attributable to an A/R CDM project activity” (version 4.0.0).
In the First Project Instances biomass (shrub, small trees) is cleared from an area >5% of the
project area and that biomass is burnt. Hence the tool is applicable.
Applicability conditions of the tool: “Tool for estimation of change in soil organic carbon stocks
version 01.1.0
(a) The areas of land (i) do neither fall into the wetland category, nor (ii) contain organic soils as
defined in “Annex A: glossary” of the IPCC GHG LULUCF 2003, as shown above. In the baseline
scenario and the project activity, the areas of land does not experience crop- or grassland
management as shown in Table 1 and 2. Shifting cultivation in the area does not include high
inputs in the form of manure or fertilizer.
(b) The areas in the ARR Restoration area meets the listed conditions. (i) Litter remains on site as
there is no incentive to remove litter from the plots. (ii) Also, soil disturbance associated with
the A/R activity only occurs for planting and is NOT repeated in less than 20 years.",3196,3196_project_description.pdf,methodology,"{'project_methodologies': ['AR-ACM0003', 'ACM0003']}",What is the methodology of this project?,"{'project_methodologies': ['AR-ACM0003', 'ACM0003']}"

1670,sector,"1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:
With a view of being in line with the sustainable development priorities of India, PPs are
promoting this Project Activity to generate a sizable green power through tapping of wind
energy in the existing barren land available in the state of Maharashtra, which is deficit in
energy and peaking power. Electricity in Maharashtra is mainly generated from the fossil fuel
dominated power plants. In the absence of the project activity, equivalent amount of
electricity would have been generated by the operation of fossil fuel dominated power plants.
The electricity grid is power deficit and hence the new capacity has to be added in the grid
system which would be fossil fuel dominated electricity generation.
The land on which the current project activity took place was practically under no use
because neither any agricultural activity nor any other commercial / economic activity
was happening at the site prior to the execution of wind farm. PPs have bought the land
for a worthwhile application and obtained necessary approvals for installation of wind
turbines.

The stake holders meetings were conducted at the respective project sites and were attended by the office
bearers and residents of the nearby villages and those employed in the project activity. The local villagers
and the office bearers expressed their happiness with the setting up of the power project in their village as
it had resulted in generation of direct and indirect employment opportunities both for literate and illiterate
people. They also hoped that with the setting up of wind power plant, the quality of power supply would
also improve and would also help in agricultural activities. They also informed that the land prices in the
village had appreciated due to the setting up of the power project in the village. The employees hired for
the project activity from the local area stated that the project activity has provided them with a means of
livelihood in their own village and will help them in getting equipped with technical skills. They stated
that such skills would help them in their career development.",622,622_1.cdm_pdd.pdf,sector,{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'},"What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?",{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}

“construction of new projects or activities or the expansion or modernization of existing
projects or activities listed in the Schedule to the above mentioned notification entailing
capacity addition with change in process and or technology shall be undertaken in any part of
India only after the prior environmental clearance from the Central Government or as the case
may be, by the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority, duly constituted by the

Hence all new projects or expansion and modernization of existing projects or activities listed
in category A and B of the Schedule to the notification has to obtain prior EIA clearance. Wind
power projects have not been included in either of the categories thus these projects do not

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
a) The land subject to the project activity does not fall in wetland category.
According to 2006 IPCC for National GHG Inventories (Volume 4) 22 wetlands are defined as
any land that is covered or saturated by water for all or part of the year, and that does not fall
into the Forest Land, Cropland or Grassland categories, the most common wetlands are
Peatlands and Flooded Lands.
The lands that will be included within the project area according to information collected in the
pre-project stage, these are agricultural areas, in abandoned plots (1 to 3 years); and
degraded pastures, none of them falling into the “wetland” category. Coffee and Cocoa
Agroforestry Systems do not prosper in wetlands23, therefore this land category was never
considered for the project.
b) Soil disturbance attributable to the afforestation and reforestation (A/R) clean development
mechanism (CDM) project activity does not cover more than 10 per cent of area in each of
the following lands:
(i) Land containing organic soils.
According to the definition of Organic Soils of the Glossary, Annex A, IPCC Good
Practice Guidance to LULUCF, land soils intended for the project do not fit into the
category. Considering that soil surveys developed by the project developer on the project
area (106 samples in the different land use types identified) shows carbon contents
below 10% in all cases, with a mean value of 4,45%, the project lands do not satisfy the
requirements established by the IPCC to define this type of soil.
If at least a part of the project activity is implemented on organic soils, drainage of these
soils is not allowed and not more than 10% of their area may be disturbed as result of soil
preparation for planting;
The project is not located on organic soil.
(ii) Land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and
receives inputs listed in appendices 1 and 2 to this methodology.
Considering the appendices of the methodology:
 Annex 1 “Cropland in which soil disturbance is restricted” of the methodology, there is
an amount of lands within the project that fit in the following category: Located in the
tropical montane region, with a land-use of “short-term or set aside cropland”, with
both management of “No-Till” and “Reduced Tillage” and inputs of “High without
manure”.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
 Annex 2 “Grassland in which soil disturbance is restricted”, no land within the project
is included; due to the amount of inputs of the 2006 IPCC for National GHG
Inventories is very low.
Even though some lands within the project boundary may be included as “Located in
the tropical montane region, with a land-use of “short-term or set aside cropland”, with
both management of “No-Till” and “Reduced Tillage” and inputs of “High without
manure” as defined on Annex 1 of the methodology, the methodology is still
applicable.
The soil disturbance attributable to the project will cover in no case more than 10 per
cent of the area. No machinery is used for soil preparation and installation trees. For
denser systems, which are pure forest plantations, it is estimated a maximum density
of planting of 1110 trees / ha with spacing of 3 m x 3 m, with digging pits no larger
than 0,30 m x 0,30 m (length x width), covering approximately 1% of the area. For
agroforestry systems, including coffee and cocoa plants and trees (a maximum of
4500 + 320 plants-trees) it is a maximum of 4.5% of the soil area that will be disturbed
during implantation.
The combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality in
A/R CDM project activities, has the following applicability conditions:
 Forestation of the land within the proposed project boundary performed with or
without being registered as the A/R CDM project activity shall not lead to violation of
any applicable law even if the law is not enforced.
The lands included in the project legally belong to producers whom voluntarily
registered in the project. There is no law that forbids the forestry or agroforestry use of
the lands.
 The tool is not applicable to small-scale afforestation and reforestation activities.

The calculation of the operating margin emission factor (EF ) is based on one of grid,OM,y
the following methods:
1) Simple OM
2) Simple adjusted OM
3) Dispatch data analysis OM
4) Average OM
According to Thailand’s data, the simple OM method (Ex ante Option) is the most appropriate
method. This method requires the latest 3 years data including quantity of electricity generated;
fuel types used and fuel consumption of each fuel type. This study used data obtained in the year
2008-2010 due to the following reasons:
• In Thailand, the generated electricity that is transferred to the national grid is the only available
data. Thus, it is not possible to obtain off-grid electricity generation data.
• Low-cost/must-run (LC/MR) power plants include hydro and renewable power plants. The
quantity of electricity generated by these power plants is not included in the calculation because it
is less than 50% of total grid generation.
Year LC/MR, MWh Total grid, MWh LC/MR share
2006 9,961.12 139,421.94 7.14%

2010 7,587.23 160,190.96 4.74%
6.32%
LC/MR – Low-cost/must run
Low cost/must run resources constitute an average of 6.32 % of total generation which is less
than 50%. On this basis, Option (a), the Simple OM has been selected.
Step 4: Calculate the operating margin emission factor according to the selected method
The simple OM emission factor is calculated as the generation-weighted average CO2 emissions
per unit net electricity generation (tCO2/MWh) of all generating power plants serving the system,
not including low-cost/must-run power plants/units.
The simple OM may be calculated by one of the following two options:
Option A: Based on the net electricity generation and a CO2 emission factor of each power unit;
or
Option B: Based on the total net electricity generation of all power plants serving the system and
the fuel types and total fuel consumption of the project electricity system.
Option B is selected to calculate OM emission factor due to the following reasons:
a) The necessary data for option A is not available such as data of net electricity
generation of each power plant/unit serving the system;
b) Only nuclear and renewable power generation are considered as low-cost/must-run power
sources and the quantity of electricity supplied to the grid by these sources is known; and
c) Off-grid power plants are not included in the calculation.
The Operating Margin emission factor is calculated by using Simple OM , Option B as per
the following equation:

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
Project activity instances displacing grid energy at the end user will meet the applicability conditions
of the UNFCCC CDM small-scale methodology AMS-I.F, Version 02:
• The Project Activity is renewable energy generation (wind) that supplies electricity to one
or more users, and displaces electricity from an electricity distribution system supplied by
a national or region grid (re: paragraph 1.a. of the methodology).
• The Project Activity may also supply electricity directly to a national/regional grid (re:
paragraph 3 and Table 2 of the methodology). In such case Methodology AMS-I.D
would apply (see above).
• The Project Activity involves the installation of new power plants at a site where there
was no renewable energy power plant operating prior to the implementation of the
Project Activity (re: paragraph 6 of the methodology).
• The Project Activity is not a hydro power plant; therefore, the applicability condition
related to hydro power plants is not relevant.
• The Project Activity is not a biomass power plant; therefore, the applicability condition
related to biomass power plants is not relevant.
• The Project Activity does not involve capacity addition of renewable energy generating
units at an existing renewable power generation facility; therefore, the applicability
condition related to capacity addition of renewable energy generating units at an existing
renewable power generation facility is not relevant.
• The Project Activity is not a retrofit or replacement; therefore the applicability condition
related to a retrofit or replacement is not relevant.
• The Project Activity does not have both renewable and non-renewable components;
therefore, the applicability condition related to new units having both renewable and non-
renewable components is not relevant.
• The Project Activity is not a combined heat and power system; therefore, the applicable
condition related to combined heat and power is not relevant.
• If any electricity produced by the Project Activity is delivered to a third party, a contract
between the supplier and consumer of the energy will be executed that insures no
double counting of emission reductions.",820,820_proj_desc_820_24jan2012.pdf,methodology,"{'project_methodologies': ['AMS-I.D.', 'AMS-I.F.']}",What is the methodology of this project?,"{'project_methodologies': ['AMS-I.D.', 'AMS-I.F.']}"

Reference: AMS-I.D (Version 18.0)2
For the determination of the baseline, Version 18 of CDM approved baseline and monitoring methodology
AMS-I.D. – “Grid-connected renewable electricity generation” is applied. For baseline calculations AMS-
I.D. refers to the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system”, Version 7.0. Additionality
(see 2.5) is demonstrated via application of the “Tool for the demonstration and assessment of
additionality”, Version 07.0.

4. Assessment of the validity of the original/current baseline and update of the baseline at the
renewal of the crediting period (Version 03.0.1)6
The choice of methodology AMS-I.D, version 18, is justified as the proposed project activity meets the
relevant applicability criteria:
• The project is a Greenfield renewable energy power plant;
• The project is a small scale activity with a capacity less than 15 MWe;
• The project does not results in construction of a new reservoir.
Sirma HPP is a greenfield grid connected small-scale hydro power plant with 5.88 MWe installed capacity.
Installed capacity is below appropriate equivalent of limit for small-scale project activity, which is 15 MWe
for power generation activities. Regarding project emissions of hydro power plants, AMS-I.D. refers to
ACM0002 where PD (power density) of the water reservoir is considered for determination of reservoir

The Shanxi Danfeng IFM Project (hereafter “the project activity”) is implemented in Danfeng
County, Shangluo City, Shanxi Province of China by Danfeng County Construction
Development Group Co., Ltd (hereafter “the project proponent”). The geo-coordinate of the
project proponent is 110°7'E -110°49'E and 33°21'N - 33°5'N, the total area is 240,740 ha,
which includes the IFM project.
The project activity quantifies the GHG emission reductions and removals generated from
improving forest management practices to increase the carbon stock on land by extending
the rotation age of a forest or patch of forest before harvesting. By extending the age at
which trees are cut, projects increase the average carbon stock on the land and remove
more emissions from the atmosphere.
The area of the project activity is 10,900.72 ha, including 2,222 sub-compartments spreading
over Caichuan Town, Dihua Town, Huapingzi Town, Longjuzhai Town, Luanzhuang Town,
Shangshan Forest Farm, Shang Town, Tieyupu Town, Wuguan Town, Yuling Town of Shanxi
Danfeng. All these forests are state-owned forests or collective-owned, and have the legal
right to forest ownership. The species involved in the project is Pitch Pine.

1778,project_description,"3.1.4.3.5. Projection of the Location of Future Deforestation
Dynamic EGO software was used to project the location of future deforestation. This software is indicated
by the VM0015 methodology as appropriate for baseline modeling of REDD+ projects to prevent unplanned
deforestation (AUD). The use of Dinamica EGO is justified by the following reasons: a) it is a model available
in scientific publications67; b) it has a transparent process for input and output of data and parameters
processed with an easy-to-understand graphical interface; c) it incorporates the use of appropriate data to
explain the location of deforestation; d) it has an adequate instrument to assess uncertainties68.
The main steps taken in this step were:
1. Organization of georeferenced maps of land use and land cover and georeferenced maps with
the explanatory factors of deforestation.
2. Calibration of the model by determining the weights of evidence (WoE presented in Figure 13)
and analysis of the correlation between the variables;
3. Evaluation of the accuracy of the model (Figure of Merit - FOM);
4. Development of deforestation base scenarios.
• Preparation of factor maps
To carry out this step, the empirical approach was used to create factorial maps (spatial variables that
explain the location of deforestation). Studies on deforestation in the Amazon show that maps of distances
from spatial attributes (roads, localities, etc.) and ecological aspects of the landscape (relief, soils and
vegetation, etc.) have a high correlation with the location of new deforestation69.
To elaborate the risk map and calibrate the future deforestation projection model, the Dinamica EGO
software requires that the input spatial variables be independent before using them. Six independent spatial
variables were used to produce the deforestation risk map (Table 23). In the Dynamic EGO, spatial data
were processed with a pixel size of 30 x 30 meters (same resolution as PRODES rasters), GeoTiff format
(Geodetic coordinate system) and dimensions of 1566 rows by 1860 columns.

CCB Version 3, VCS Version 3
• Elaboration of deforestation risk maps
Deforestation risk maps show the regions with the highest (risk close to or equal to 1) or lowest conditions
for deforestation to occur (risk close to or equal to 0). In this baseline study, the risk map was produced
using the evidence weights method (Bonham-Carter, 1994) available in Dinamica EGO 7. This method
calculates the probability of transition from forest to deforested area at each pixel in the reference region,
based on the sum of all evidence weights that overlap at a given pixel, and dependent on combinations of
all static and dynamic maps81.
The result of applying the weight of evidence method in Dynamics EGO is a deforestation risk map that
identifies areas with a higher (1.0) and lower (0.0) probability of deforestation (Figure 15). The spatial
variables presented in Table 26, together with the deforestation risk map, are the starting point for
production of future deforestation baseline scenarios.
Figure 15: Map of deforestation risk in the Reference Region.
• Selection of the most accurate deforestation risk map (Calibration and Validation of the
model)
To evaluate the quality of the model produced, the option ""a"" available in the VM0015 version 1.1
methodology was used: calibration and confirmation through two historical subperiods. Data on
deforestation between 2013 and 2017 and the variables listed were used to calibrate the model, while the
deforestation map mapped by Prodes in 2022 was used for the confirmation process. In this process, a
2022 deforestation map was simulated from the data observed between 2013 and 2017.

o Category: I.D. ‘Grid Connected Renewable Energy Generation’
For further details regarding the applicability criteria pertaining to the above-
mentioned type and category in the context of the project activity, please refer
to section 2.2 of the VCS PD.
• Voluntary Carbon Standard 2007.1 defines grouped projects in the following
manner:
“Any combination of GHG projects or project categories that meets the
requirements of the VCS 2007.1 can be registered as a grouped project. A
grouped project can include one or more sub-groups, for example a
combination of project categories or projects, as long as each sub group
retains its distinctive characteristics. A grouped project shall have one central
GHG information system and controls associated with the project and its
monitoring. It is anticipated that such central GHG information system and
controls will include items identified in ISO14064-3:2006, clause 4.5.
A number of projects and their related methodologies included in a single
VCS Project Description (VCS PD) at the time of the validation.”
For the project activity under consideration, the various individual components
bundled together, i.e., wind-mills fall under the purview of the same project
category (as indicated above) and follow the same methodology, i.e., AMS-
I.D, as established in Section 2.2 of the Project Description. Furthermore, the
bundled project does not have one central GHG information system and
controls associated with the project and its monitoring, as required for a

VCS Project Description
This project is a power generation project using renewable (wind) energy sources supplying energy to
regional electricity grid. In absence of the project activity the equivalent amount of power would have been
generated from the power plants that are connected to the grid. Hence this project is eligible for emission
reduction claims.
The amount of GHG reduction from this project activity is estimated to be 4,912 tCO e per year. The 2
details of has been provided in section 4.2 of this document.
The projects are implemented in the states of Tamil Nadu where there are no legislative or sectoral rules
that guides /mandates the project proponent to invest in this kind of project activity.
The geographical and location details have been provided in section 1.5 of this document.
The project activity helps in sustainable development of the local population in the following way.
Social well being
Rural and infrastructural development in the areas around the project.
The project activity has assisted in higher interaction amongst the local villagers thereby
increasing the flow of information in the villages thereby levels of awareness and knowledge in
the community.
Environmental well being
Reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels in the grid for generating additional electricity
equivalent to that generated by the wind mills;
CO abatement and reduction of green house emission through development of renewable 2
technology.
The project has reduced the local air pollutants and environmental impacts due to increased share
of electricity generation through wind power.
Economic well being
Help in economic development of remote villages in Tamil Nadu by making investment in that
area.

1 PROJECT DETAILS
1.1 Summary Description of the Project
The purpose of this grouped project (the project) is the dissemination of clean energy products to
households, communities, institutions or SMEs. The clean energy products include solar lighting,
solar water heating, and solar PV; technical specifications are included in Appendix 1. The
Project Proponent will distribute these clean energy products in Karnataka, Maharashtra and
throughout India.
Prior to the implementation of the project:
 lighting was provided through kerosene lamps. The project therefore generates emission
reductions by replacing kerosene use with solar lighting, in accordance with AMS-III.AR.
 hot water was provided through electric boilers. The project therefore generates emission
reductions by replacing carbon intensive electricity used in the electric boilers with solar
energy, in accordance with AMS-I.J.
 electricity, primarily for captive use, was generated by a national or regional grid, fossil fuel
fired captive power plant, or a carbon intensive mini-grid. The project therefore generates
emission reductions by replacing carbon intensive electricity generation with solar electricity,
in accordance with AMS-I.F.
The Project Proponent is a social enterprise, established in 1995, providing sustainable energy
solutions and services to under-served households and businesses. Selco, through this project,
aims to empower its customer by providing a complete package of product, service and
consumer financing through grameena banks, cooperative societies, commercial banks and
micro-finance institutions.
The emission reductions associated with each clean energy product are calculated below in
accordance with the default factors in the approved methodology for solar lighting, and solar
water heating, and the grid emission factor in case of solar PV. In the first year of the project,
calendar year 2014, the project proponent disseminated 18,222 solar lights, 1,452 solar water
heating systems, and 207 grid-connected solar PV systems. It is anticipated that the project
proponents will distribute 40,000 solar lights, 3,000 solar water heating systems, and 200 grid-
connected solar PV systems each further year of the crediting period, but actual numbers depend
on customer demand. The ex-ante estimated annual average GHG emission reductions are
34,551 tCO e, and 345,512 tCO e over the first crediting period. 2 2

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
Selco is a social enterprise established in 1995 whose mission is to enhance the quality of life of
underserved households and livelihoods through sustainable energy solutions and services.1
Selco aims to empower its customer by providing a complete package of product, service and
consumer financing through grameena banks, co-operative societies, commercial banks and
micro-finance institutions. Selco is a two-times winner of the Ashden Awards.
Natural Capital Partners, formerly The CarbonNeutral Company, works with clients to combine
business success with positive impact on the environment and society.2 Through collaboration
with global project partners, the development of innovative solutions, and understanding the
specific goals of its clients, the company delivers a broad range of products and services for
carbon, energy, water, biodiversity and communities in direct operations, consumer markets and
supply chains – the world’s natural capital. Founded in 1997 and with more than 300 clients in 34
countries, Natural Capital Partners has been recognised as Best Offset Retailer by Environmental
Finance in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. The award, which is voted on by industry peers,
recognises the company’s commitment to quality and innovation in the delivery of solutions for
our clients’ environmental and sustainability programmes, focusing on helping businesses
achieve value from their environmental programmes.
Selco and Natural Capital Partners’ partnership goes back to 2002-2003 when they jointly
developed two voluntary emission reduction projects. These pioneering projects, one promoting
solar lights, the other solar water heating, pre-date the establishment of the VCS and the
registration of the first CDM project. Over their ten-year life, these two projects impacted more
than 27,000 households in rural Karnataka, and reduced emissions by more than 75,000 tonnes.
Sustainable impacts
The project has been assessed with the Sustainable Impacts Evaluation Tool, a proprietary tool
developed by Natural Capital Partners to enable it to assess the quality of the Sustainable
Impacts delivered through a (carbon offset) project in order to provide a clear, simple description
of the impacts – or co-benefits – and deepen the integrity of the communication of these benefits.
The Sustainable Impacts Evaluation Tool provides a consistent approach to identifying which
projects deliver a Sustainable Impact at a significant enough level to recognise that project for the
relevant Sustainable Impact.
The 12 Sustainable Impact categories were chosen based upon an extensive process of
evaluation of various types of impact categories which have been of relevance to voluntary
buyers over the years, and are relevant for carbon offset methodologies and the Sustainable
Development Goals. The project proponents will collect data and identify relevant indicators and
measurements of impacts over the lifetime of the project.
 Energy access: Despite the rapid growth of renewable energy on the national level, the rural
poor are left behind. The project distributes clean energy products to these under-served
households and communities. During the first year of the project implementation it has
improved energy access for more than 9,300 households, and aims to reach at least 20,000
each year.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
 Financial security: The distributed clean energy products reduce or eliminate fuel costs.
Improved lighting provides potential for increased income generating opportunities. However,
the greatest hurdle in the distribution of these various clean energy products is the users’
lack of access to finance. Selco brings together the users and banks to provide this finance
in the most appropriate format. However, with a strong focus on the poorest households and
communities, micro-finance institutions are often needed where banks can not lend. Selco
aims to align the repayment schedule both with savings made on fuel purchases and users’
income structure (e.g. weekly or monthly wages), reducing the risk to lenders, thus enabling
increased access to loans and other banking services for those that did not have access
previously.
 Education and skills: The project includes a specific “light for education” programme, as well
as solar PV installations for schools. In the light for education programme, a joint solar panel
and battery charger is installed in a school, charging some 20 to 25 batteries at the same
time and lights available for the students. This programme provides the students with light for
studying in the evenings and also encourages attendance. The solar PV installations are
generally linked to IT suites in schools, providing schools the opportunity to teach computer
science despite the erratic grid.
 Women’s empowerment: A large share of the clean energy products are distributed through
women’s groups, including the micro-finance to be able to pay for the products.
 Health and well-being: The solar lighting in this grouped project displaces and/or eradicates
kerosene lighting in the participating households. The World Health Organization concludes
that “the combination of widespread use, high levels of exposure to PM and other health
damaging pollutants, and tentative epidemiological evidence suggests there should be
strong concern about the possible or likely health impacts of kerosene combustion, in
addition to the risks of burns, fires and poisoning”.3 According to UNEP4, users of kerosene
lamps pay a huge price in terms of human wellbeing: in the form of injuries from burns,
poisoning of children, health impacts from kerosene combustion products such as particulate
matter (PM); insufficient illumination for education of children. Therefore, the reduction of
kerosene use will be beneficial to health and well-being, but the scale of benefits may
depend on other factors such as the continued use of inefficient cook stoves.
 Economic growth: The project helps create universal access to modern energy for the poor,
which helps lowest income households to move out of poverty. In addition, the project is
working through a network of energy centres, creating new channels and new markets in
many rural areas.
 Infrastructure development: The project helps improves the quality of buildings through the
provision of light, communication services by providing mobile phone charging facilities (also
included in the solar lighting), and improved energy infrastructure through distributed power
systems, battery charging and reaching un-electrified households.

date is for the wind mill located at location no. Q – 212, which is 20/01/2007.
Therefore the start date for this bundled project is 20/01/2007.
Crediting period start date: 20/01/2007
As for the crediting period, it can start at any time from the commissioning of the first
plant until the commissioning of the last one. Start date is the day from which the
VCS project activity will be implemented and greenhouse gas emission reductions
will be generated. In the bundle project activity the earliest WTG to commission is
20/01/2007 but as per the VCS 2007.1 standard2 (clause 5.2.1) the Crediting period
start date for the project activity is 28/03/2006.
The Crediting period start date is the same as start date of the bundled project
activity. Therefore the Crediting period start date for this bundled project is
20/01/2007. During the crediting period of first 10 years, the project activity would
deliver to the grid at least 18.18576 million kWh (approx) generated from a
renewable energy. In the absence of the project activity, the same amount of
electricity would have been produced from other sources of energy.",424,424_v-3-i-01-b-0031_7.85mw_bundled_project_in_tamilnadu_&_karnataka_vcs_pd.pdf,crediting period,"{'crediting_period_start': '2007-01-20', 'crediting_period_end': '2017-01-19'}",What are the start and end dates of the crediting period for this project?,"{'crediting_period_start': '2007-01-20', 'crediting_period_end': '2017-01-19'}"

Applicability conditions of the methodology: AR-ACM0003: Afforestation and reforestation of
lands except wetlands (Version 2):
(a) The land subject to the project activity does not fall in wetland category
Buraphas’ plantations are only established on foothills. Wetlands, as well as riparian zones are
avoided and not considered for planting.
Following the decision tree of soil classification provided by the IPCC (Figure 6: IPCC
classification of soilsFigure 6), all planting plots in the project plantations of the first instance
belong to the IPCC class Low activity clay soils (LAC). Across the complete outer boundary, most
of the soils are either LAC or a mixture of LAC and HAC soils. There is only a small area in the
Southern region of Vientiane capital province with Dystric Gleysols, which belong to IPCC class
wetlands.
Figure 6: IPCC classification of soils
1. The outer boundary of the project area is plotted against the Harmonised World Soil Database
(see FAO/IIASA/ISRIC/ISSCAS/JRC, 2009) which summarizes the latest regional soil
information as compiled by various partners. (see Figure 7Figure 8).

2. According to this map the project is dominated by Orthic Acrisols (IPCC: LAC). Plantations occur
also on Dystric Nitosols (IPCC: LAC) and Gleyic Acrisols (IPCC: LAC/HAC).Table 7 below shows
some soil parameters for this soil type in the project region.

Reference Bulk density (kg/dm3) 1.4
Topsoil gravel content (%) 10
Topsoil organic carbon (% weight) 1
Topsoil pH 4.6
Topsoil CEC (cmol/kg) 16
3. By using the decision tree and the official translation of FAO soil classes to IPCC soil classes,
which is referenced by Batjes (2009)10, all Acrisols are classified as IPCC Low Activity Clay soils.
None of the project areas (inner boundary) belong to the category of wetlands (FAO soil type
Gleysol).
(b) Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10 per cent of
area in each of the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project
boundary:
(i) Land containing organic soils;
(ii) land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and
receives inputs listed in appendices 1 and 2 to the methodology.
The project land does not contain organic soils as demonstrated above. The project land does
not receive any inputs according to appendices 1 and 2 of the AR methodology (CDM), but is
subject to shifting agriculture. Because of long periods of fallow vegetation however, it is not
considered to be specific subject to land use.

1834,sector,"4.3 Quantifying GHG emissions and/or removals for the
project:
The Methodology is applied in the context of the project activity in order to calculate the
project emissions and leakages as follows:
Project Emissions:
As the project activity is a wind power project, there are no anthropogenic emissions by
sources of GHGs within the project boundary as a result of the project activity. Hence
there are no project emissions to be considered.
The main emissions in the context of renewable energy projects (including wind-mills) of
the power sector are emissions arising due to activities such as power plant
construction and fuel handling (extraction, processing, and transport). The GHG
emissions due to the above mentioned sources of emission are negligible with respect
to the lifetime of the project activity under consideration.
Leakage Emissions:
As per the methodology AMS-I.D./ Version 1422,
“If the energy generating equipment is transferred from another activity ,leakage is to be
considered”.
There are no anthropogenic emissions identified by sources outside the project
boundary due to the project activity. Furthermore, the equipments (WTGs) used by the
project activity are newly procured and hence not transferred from another project.
Thus, there are no leakage emissions attributable to the project activity.
Thus, the GHG emissions attributable to the project activity (project emissions) in the
project year y are expressed as:

Further, the following WTGs have applied for carbon credits under CDM, but there is no
progress in the CDM process of the same.
However, in order to avoid double counting of the emission reductions from the above
said turbines, only retroactive emission reductions would be claimed in case the project
gets registered under CDM.

Environment and Forests, Government of India, New Delhi, the 27th January, 1994
(Incorporating amendments made on 04/05/1994, 10/04/1997, 27/1/2000, 13/12/2000,
01/08/2001 and 21/11/2001) - S.O.60 (E), the project does not require EIA
submission23.
Since the project activity is a wind based project activity, there is no requirement that
the project get clearance from the Pollution Control Board. However, prior to the
installation of the wind turbine generators of the project activity, the project proponents
got a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Tamil Nadu State Electricity Board,
Department of Non Conventional Energy Sources. Copies of NOC from the state
Electricity Board would be provided.
However, there are no negative impacts on air, water, soil quality and ambience
envisaged due to the project activity.

2.2Justification of the choice of the methodology and why
it is applicable to the project activity:
The applicability criteria of the methodology AMS-I.D. and their relevance with
respect to the project activity under consideration are addressed as follows:
1. “This category comprises renewable energy generation units, such as
photovoltaics, hydro, tidal/wave, wind, geothermal and renewable biomass, that
supply electricity to and/or displace electricity from an electricity distribution system
that is or would have been supplied by at least one fossil fuel fired generating unit.”
The project activity involves the setting up of wind farms, i.e., renewable generating
units of cumulative generation capacity 7.85 MW to harness a renewable source of
energy (wind power potential) and export the generated electricity to the fossil fuel
dominated electricity generation and distribution system, i.e. the Southern Regional
Electricity Grid of India11. In the process, an equivalent quantum of electricity that
would have been generated by the grid in line with the grid electricity generation mix
is displaced by the project activity. The carbon intensity of the fossil-fuel dominated
generation mix of the grid is evident from the following break-up of various types of
energy sources constituting the grid-mix contributing electricity to the Southern Grid
system.
Table 10: Installed capacity of southern Region as on 31st
March 2006
Source: Annual Grid Report 12
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
2. “If the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a
wind/diesel unit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small-scale CDM project activity
applies only to the renewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel, the
capacity of the entire unit shall not exceed the limit of 15MW”.
The project activity involves only wind power generation. The gross wind power
generation capacity of the bundled project activity is 7.85 MW, which is less than 15
MW, as stipulated in the applicability criterion under consideration.

VCS Project Description Template
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
3. “Combined heat and power (co-generation) systems are not eligible under
this category”
The project activity involves generation of electricity only through WTGs and is not a
co-generation system.
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
4. “In the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy
generation units at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added
capacity of the units added by the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be
physically distinct from the existing units.”
The project activity does not involve the addition of renewable energy generation
units at an existing renewable power generation facility.
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
5. “Project activities that seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for
renewable energy generation are included in this category. To qualify as a small
scale project, the total output of the modified or retrofitted unit shall not exceed the
limit of 15 MW”
The renewable energy generating wind-farms employed by the project activity are
newly constructed set up and does not involve retrofitting or modification of any
existing facility for renewable energy generation.
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
Thus, the project activity fulfills all the applicability criteria of the simplified small scale

VCS Project Description
1.12 Demonstration to confirm that the project was not implemented to create GHG
emissions primarily for the purpose of its subsequent removal or destruction.
The project activity primarily aims at displacement of grid electricity in which majority
of power is generated from fossil fuels like coal. Therefore the aim of the project
activity is to reduce GHG emissions instead of to create GHG emissions primarily for
the purpose of its subsequent removal or destruction.
1.13 Demonstration that the project has not created another form of environmental
credit (for example renewable energy certificates).
The project so far has not created any other form of environmental credit (renewable
energy certificates). This project has not been considered for CDM registration and an
exclusive VCS project.
1.14 Project rejected under other GHG programs (if applicable):
The project activity has approached only VCS 2007.1 Standard GHG Program and
hence this is not applicable.

The project was not implemented to create GHG emissions primarily and its
subsequent removal or destruction. The project activity by generation of
electricity through a wind power generating unit displaces the fossil fuel
based electricity generation by the Southern regional grid. In the absence
of the project activity GHG emissions would have definitely occurred due to
equivalent electricity generation in the grid from fossil fuel based
sources.
In actual fact, a conventional energy equivalent of approximately 49923 MWh
for a period of 14 months in Karnataka would be displaced by renewable power
from the project activity with CO2 emission reduction of 46394 tonnes.
Without the project activity, the same energy load would have been given to
the Southern regional grid mix via other no non renewable sources and
emission of CO2 would have occurred due to combustion of fossil fuel based
electricity generation. Thus the project activity would help in reduction of
combined margin carbon intensity of the grid. Considering the export of
clean electricity to the fossil fuel dominated grid by the project activity
there will be continuous GHG reductions, as it would avoid equivalent GHG
emissions.

involve creation/emission of GHG in any of the stages.",345,345_vcs_project_description_karnataka.pdf,sector,{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'},"What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?",{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}

2.2 Justification of the choice of the methodology and why it is applicable to the
project activity:
The applicability criteria of the methodology AMS-I.D. and their relevance with respect to the
project activity under consideration are addressed as follows:
1. “This category comprises renewable energy generation units, such as photovoltaics,
hydro, tidal/wave, wind, geothermal and renewable biomass, that supply electricity to and/or
displace electricity from an electricity distribution system that is or would have been supplied
by at least one fossil fuel fired generating unit.”
The project activity involves the setting up of wind farms, i.e., renewable generating units of
cumulative generation capacity 15 MW to harness a renewable source of energy (wind power
potential) and export the generated electricity to the fossil fuel dominated electricity
generation and distribution system, i.e. the NEWNE Regional Electricity Grid of India3. In
the process, an equivalent quantum of electricity that would have been generated by the grid
in line with the grid electricity generation mix is displaced by the project activity. The carbon
intensity of the fossil-fuel dominated generation mix of the grid is evident from the following
break-up of various types of energy sources constituting the grid-mix contributing electricity
to the NEWNE Grid system, as shown in Table below Mar 05.
3 The NEWNE Regional Electricity Grid of India is primarily constituted of fossil- fuel fired thermal power plants. Refer to CO 2

VCS Project Description Template
(Source :http://www.cea.nic.in/ceaarchive/body/Reports/Executive%20Summary/2006/2006_06/8.pdf
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
2. “If the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a
wind/diesel unit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small-scale CDM project activity applies
only to the renewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel, the capacity of the
entire unit shall not exceed the limit of 15MW”.
The project activity involves only wind power generation. The gross wind power generation
capacity of the project activity is 15 MW which is meets the eligibility limit of small-scale
CDM project activity, as stipulated in the applicability criterion under consideration.
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
3. “Combined heat and power (co-generation) systems are not eligible under this
category”
The project activity involves generation of electricity only through WTGs and is not a co-
generation system. Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
4. “In the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy
generation units at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added capacity of the
units added by the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be physically distinct
from the existing units.”
The project activity does not involve the addition of renewable energy generation units at an
existing renewable power generation facility. Hence the project activity complies with this
criterion.
5. “Project activities that seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for renewable
energy generation are included in this category. To qualify as a small scale project, the total
output of the modified or retrofitted unit shall not exceed the limit of 15 MW”
The renewable energy generating wind-farms employed by the project activity are newly
constructed set up and do not involve retrofitting or modification of any existing facility for
renewable energy generation. Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
Thus, the project activity fulfills all the applicability criteria of the simplified small scale
methodology AMS-I.D./ Version 14.",298,"298_v-3-i-01-s-0033_-_aryan_coal_15_mw_wind_project_in_maharashtra,_india_vcs_pd.pdf",sector,{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'},"What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?",{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
As described above, the Guachicono Small Hydroelectric Plant supplies electricity to
Colombian grid. Therefore, as described in Table 1 of the methodology, AMS-I.D. is
suitable to the proposed project activity.
4. The Small Scale Methodology AMS-I.D is applicable to project activities that:
(a) Install a Greenfield power plant;
(b) Involve a capacity addition to (an) existing plant(s);
(c) Involve a retrofit of (an) existing operating plants/units;
(d) Involve a rehabilitation of (an) existing plant(s)/unit(s); or
(e) Involve a replacement of (an) existing plant(s)/unit(s).
In this case, the proposed project activity involves grid-connected renewable energy
power generation through the installation of a run-of-river Small Hydroelectric Plant which
corresponds to option (a) Greenfield power plant.
5. Hydro power plants with reservoirs that satisfy at least one of the following conditions are
eligible to apply this methodology:
(a) The project activity is implemented in an existing reservoir with no change in the volume of
reservoir;
(b) The project activity is implemented in an existing reservoir, where the volume of reservoir is
increased and the power density of the project activity, as per definitions given in the project
emissions section, is greater than 4 W/m2;
(c) The project activity results in new reservoirs and the power density of the power plant, as per
definitions given in the project emissions section, is greater than 4 W/m2.
The proposed project activity involves renewable energy power generation through the
installation of a hydro power plant without reservoir. Thus, this condition is met.
6. If the new unit has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a wind/diesel unit),
the eligibility limit of 15 MW for a small-scale CDM project activity applies only to the renewable
component. If the new unit co-fires fossil fuel, the capacity of the entire unit shall not exceed the
limit of 15 MW.
The proposed project activity has not non-renewable components. Hence, it does not co-
fire fossil fuels. The maximum output capacity of Guachicono Small Hydropower Plant is
13.33 MW, and which will not increase beyond 15 MW.
7. Combined heat and power (co-generation) systems are not eligible under this category.
Not applicable. The proposed project activity does not correspond to a combined heat
and power system.
8. In the case of project activities that involve the capacity addition of renewable energy
generation units at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added capacity of the
units added by the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be physically distinct1 from
the existing units.
Not applicable. As discussed above, the proposed project activity corresponds to a
Greenfield plant.
9. In the case of retrofit, rehabilitation or replacement, to qualify as a small-scale project, the total
output of the retrofitted, rehabilitated or replacement power plant/unit shall not exceed the limit of
15 MW.

1894,methodology,"3.2 Applicability of Methodology
This section provides evidence that AR-ACM0003 version 02.0 is applicable. According to the
methodology’s section 2.2 Applicability, the methodology is applicable if the following
conditions are met:
a) The land subject to the project activity does not fall in wetland category;
There are no wetlands within the project boundary [2].
b) Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10 per cent of
area in each of the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project
boundary:
(i) Land containing organic soils;
Amongst the encountered soil series (Ultisols and Alfisols), no organic soils are present within
the project boundary [2].
(ii) Land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and
receives inputs listed in appendices 1 and 2 to this methodology.
The project area is characterized as degraded pasture land and, in areas closer to population
centers, this is combined with subsistence farming [2].
47

Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.0
The lands of Appendix 1 refer to cropland in which soil disturbance is restricted. Farming in the
area is characterized as small-scale subsistence farming [2], which is characterized as
cultivation with reduced tillage and limited use of inputs. Therefore, the project area does not
classify as land listed in Appendix 1.
The lands of Appendix 2 refer to grassland in which soil disturbance is restricted. Grasslands in
the project area are used for extensive livestock ranching activities and without the use of
inputs [17]. Therefore, the project area does not classify as land listed in Appendix 2.
Furthermore, the tool Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate
additionality in A/R CDM project activities is applicable, as the forestation of the land […] does
not lead to violation of any applicable law […] and the project does not concern a small - scale
afforestation (<15 kton of CO2Eq annually), as shown in section 1.10.
As for the tool Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in
A/R CDM project activities, no applicability conditions exist, and the tool can therefore be
applied.
For the Estimation of the increase in GHG emissions attributable to displacement of pre-project
agricultural activities in A/R CDM project activity, the tool is not applicable if displacement of
agricultural activities is expected to cause, directly or indirectly, any drainage of wetlands or
peat lands. As demonstrated above, the project does not take place in wetlands or peatlands,
and therefore the tool is applicable.
As for the Tool for estimation of change in soil organic carbon stocks due to the implementation
of A/R CDM project activities, the requirements for applicability are that areas do not fall into
the wetlands category (compliance covered above), litter remains on site and is not removed in
the A/R CDM project activity (true, litter is not removed on site through management practices);
and soil disturbance […] is in accordance with appropriate soil conservation practices and
limited to soil disturbances for site preparation before planting and such disturbance is not
repeated in less than twenty years. The latter conditions are also true, as soil disturbance only
takes place once in twenty years with the site preparation before planting with the tree species
[17].
Concerning the Tool for the identification of degraded or degrading lands for consideration in
implementing CDM A/R project activities, the applicability is limited to projects in the A/R
category, which is the case for the current project, as the project concerns a reforestation
project.

generation project activities that (a) install a new power plant at a site where no renewable power
plant was operated prior to the implementation of the project activity (green field plant); (b) involve
a capacity addition; (c) involve a retrofit of (an) existing plant(s); or (d) involve a replacement of
(an) existing plant(s).
The methodology is applicable under the following conditions:
 The project activity is the installation, capacity addition, retrofit or replacement of a power
plant/unit of one of the following types: hydro power plant/unit (either with a run-of-river reservoir
or an accumulation reservoir), wind power plant/unit, geothermal power plant/unit, solar power
plant/unit, wave power plant/unit or tidal power plant/unit;
1. Applicability according to the above provision:
Gokgedik HEPP Project is the installation of a grid connected renewable power generation project
which adds electricity capacity to the grid from hydro power sources and which supplies electricity
to a system that is supplied by at least one fossil fuel fired generating unit. The project involves
construction of new units in a brand new plant, in other words the project does neither involve the
addition of renewable energy generation units at an existing renewable power generation facility
nor does it foresee to retrofit or modify an expired facility of renewable energy generation. The
project is a renewable electricity generation plant, in the form of a runoff river type hydropower
plant. It is located at a site where no renewable power plant was operated prior to the
implementation of the project activity (greenfield plant). All related files which justify the situation
of being a grid connected greenfield plant are provided as supplementary documents (Check 25-

increased and the power density of the project activity is identified as far greater than 4 W/m2 by
considering that Gokgedik project is a run-of river type HEPP and does not include water storage
as clearly stated in “Revised Feasibility Study Report” (pdf page 171) and EIA report.
From page 1 (.pdf page 10) of the approved EIA Report (See 25-EIA_Report file) which was
provided as a supplementary document, the following paragraph (last paragraph) can be taken
as a reference within the scope of small reservoir capacity:
“In the scope of Gokgedik Weir and HEPP Project, water storage is out consideration because
the project is a runoff river type project and energy producing water shall be regulated by the weir.
Therefore operational policy for the reservoir, optimization studies, dam type and height choice is
not provided.”
The methodology is not applicable to the following:
o Project activities that involve switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources at
the site of the project activity, since in this case the baseline may be the continued use of
fossil fuels at the site.
4. Applicability according to the above provision
The project does not involve switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy at the site of the
project activity.
o Biomass fired power plants
5. Applicability according to the above provision
The project is not a biomass fired power plant.
o A hydro power plant that results in the creation of a new single reservoir or in the
increase in an existing single reservoir or in the increase in an existing single reservoir
where the power density of the power plant is less than 4 W/m2
6. Applicability according to the above provision

Project Description: VCS Version 4.1
In the registered VCS PD, the crediting period is described as from 22-Apr-
2012~21-Oct-2012. The project is registered under VCS Standard Version 3.4
and completed validation before 19-March-2020. Thus, it remains eligible to
apply the crediting period requirements under VCS Standard Version 3, which
shall be a maximum of ten years and may be renewed at most twice. Hence,
the first renewable crediting period of the project has been updated from 22-
Apr-2012~21-Oct-2012 to 22-Apr-2012~21-Apr-2022.
The project is also a registered CDM project (Ref.7757) with a 7*3 renewable
project crediting period, the VCS issuance is not eligible for beyond the end of
those 21 years. Furthermore, given that the VCS crediting period started on
22-Apr-2012 and the lifetime of the project is about 20 years. The total VCS
crediting period was determined from 22-Apr-2012 to 21-April-2032, of which
the first VCS crediting period is from 22-Apr-2012 to 21-Apr-2022 and the
second VCS crediting period is from 22-Apr-2022 to 21-Apr-2032 (10 years).",1184,1184_pd_cp_renewal_vcs1184_hebei_chengde_weichang_wuxiangliang_wind_power_project.pdf,crediting period,"{'crediting_period_start': '2022-04-22', 'crediting_period_end': '2032-04-21'}",What are the start and end dates of the crediting period for this project?,"{'crediting_period_start': '2022-04-22', 'crediting_period_end': '2032-04-21'}"

• OROGRAPHY AND HYDROGRAPHY
Together with PUGLIA and CALABRIA, the BASILICATA REGION (once called LUCANIA) is one
of the three regions overlooking two seas.
107

Project description: VCS Version 4.2
In fact, for 20 km it is bathed by the Tyrrhenian Sea and for 40 km by the Ionian Sea.
47% of the region is made up of mountains, 45% of hills and 8% of plains only.
For this reason it can be said that BASILICATA is one of the most mountainous and rugged regions of ITALY.
The mountains are part of the southern Apennines: they are rough hills covered with woods that
descend with parallel valleys towards the gulf of TARANTO.
The LUCANO mountain system has two geographically interesting areas: the POLLINO and the
VULTURE.
VULTURE is an ancient volcano, now extinct, but once very active.
It died out in prehistoric times and from numerous springs that opened at the bottom of the crater
water came out which slowly filled the cavity, thus forming two lakes, while the surrounding
countryside was covered with lush forests.
Today VULTURE reaches a height of 600 meters and offers tourism two lakes: the small lake and the
large lake of MONTICCHIO.
POLLINO is located on the border with CALABRIA and it is here that the Apennines reach their highest
altitudes.
The two main peaks are MONTE POLLINO and SERRA del DORCEDORME which exceed 2,000
meters above sea level and both are located in CALABRIA.
The only large LUCANA plain is the METAPONDO plain, of fluvial origin.
In fact, it is crossed by several rivers which both flow into the Ionian Sea, with a rather short
route.
They are: BRADANO, BASENTO, ANGRI and SINNI.
Given the conformation of the territory, they have a torrential nature and over the millennia they
have dug the arid earth of the highlands, exposing the rocks.
Now, along their course there are dams that have the function of harnessing and regulating the
impetuous waters.
The plain is tougher fertile and in it and in the plain itself many canalization and irrigation works
have been carried out and artificial basins have been formed which have made it more
productive.

2.2 Applicability of Methodology
The Proposed Project activity is a 5 MW hydro power project. The project activity generates
electricity from hydro energy (renewable sources) and same is exported to a NEWNE grid
system, which is presently dominated by fossil fuel based thermal energy sources.
Hence if the project activity would not have been there, the same amount of electricity otherwise
been generated by the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of
generation sources into the grid, which are predominantly fossil fuel based.
As hydro energy is renewable source of energy therefore project activity qualifies under TYPE I.
Also there is not provision to run the project activity on any other alternate source of energy
therefore project activity qualifies under TYPE I during every year of crediting period.
The Proposed project activity is well below the qualifying limit of project activities under the small
scale methodology AMS.I.D i.e. 15 MW. Hence, AMS.I.D „Grid connected renewable electricity
generation‟ is applied to this small scale project activity.

The project activity involves installation and operation of a 21.6 MW wind power generation
project at Bhachau, in the Kutch district of Gujarat by Powerica Limited. The total installed
capacity of 21.6 MW comprises of 12 WTGs, each with a capacity of 1.80 MW. The project
provides electricity to the state of Gujarat by effective utilization of renewable resources. The
technology has been supplied by Vestas. The project utilizes wind energy for exporting electricity
which otherwise would have been generated through alternate fuels (most likely - fossil fuel)
based power plants, contributing to reduction in specific emissions (emissions of pollutant)
including GHG emissions. Electricity produced from the project activity is supplied to NEWNE
(Now Indian grid) grid of India.
Emission reductions are claimed on the net electrical energy that is supplied to grid which is
metered using meters located at the electrical yard of the respective WTGs. These electrical
energy meters are electronic tri-vector meters of appropriate accuracy class. Since these meters
are not designed to measure high voltages and currents as generated in the WTG, the WTG output
is connected to these meters via transformers (CT/PT) for stepping down the generated voltage
and current to ranges which the meters can record. As such, these meters have a multiplying
factor which when multiplied to the meter reading provides the actual amount of electricity
generated. The technology providers for the project have additionally installed an LCS meter at
the WTG controller.
The electricity generated is monitored using electrical meters which provide a measure of the
actual electrical energy that would have been sourced from a fossil-fuel based power plants in
the absence of the project activity. Hence, the fossil-fuel power based grid is the baseline for the
project activity. The annual GHG emission reductions from project activity is estimated to be
52,108 tCO e. Thus the proposed project activity leads to an emission reduction of 521,080 2
tCO e over the chosen crediting period of ten years 2
The project is a Greenfield wind power project and does not involve generation of GHG emissions
for the purpose of their subsequent reduction, removal or destruction. Thus prior to project
initiation, there was nothing at site. In absence of project activity, the continuation of current
practice i.e. generation of equivalent amount electricity would have been generated from grid
connected fossil fuel dominated power plants. Thus for project activity baseline scenario is
electricity delivered to the grid by the project activity would have otherwise been generated by
the operation of grid-connected power plants and by the addition of new generation sources.
The total emission reductions achieved by this project activity in the monitoring period from 01-
January-2021 to 31-December-2021, are 41,683 tCO e through displacing 44,623.91 MWh of 2

The Central Anatolian Province is mainly covered with steppes which mainly grow in continental
climates. But during spring the mountains and hills covered with these steppes turn green. The
plants in this region can adopt themselves easily to continental climate. The main reason why
these stepps are very common in this region is, because the region is also full of springs of salty
and hard water. The north and south of Suşehri settlement are covered with forests which are
approximately 35km. in distance. But the closest forest to the project area is 61km. away.
Because of the shallow earth layer and the wind erosion, the forests can hardly grow. Under the

1950,sector,"2.2 Justification of the choice of the methodology and why
it is applicable to the project activity:
The methodology applied is Category AMS-I.E: Switch from Non – Renewable
Biomass for Thermal Applications by the User – Version 01 from February
1st of 2008 onwards which is applicable for project activities that avoid
greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable biomass in order to generate
thermal energy.
This category comprises small thermal appliances that displace the use of
non-renewable biomass by introducing new renewable energy end-user
technologies. The end-user technology in the case of this project can be
established as the project proponent, who utilizes the thermal energy
generated by the new renewable energy technology.
There are no similar registered small-scale CDM project activities in the
region of Ceará once Carbono Social Serviços Ambientais Ltda. has made a
research and did not find any registered small–scale CDM Project activity
in the region. The sources of registered small-scale CDM project activity
consulted were the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCC)18 and Brazilian´s Technology and Science Ministry19. Therefore, the
proposed project activity is not saving the non-renewable biomass
accounted for by the other registered project activities.
The utilization of firewood from area without any kind of management
cannot be considered a renewable source of biomass, since it does
interfere in the carbon pools and increase the carbon emissions to the
atmosphere, turning greenhouse effect even worse. Moreover, the native
wood provided from areas without a reforestation management plan does not
fit any of the options of UNFCCC definition of renewable biomass in Annex
18, EB 23.
Furthermore, firewood has been used for many centuries as fuel in
Brazil20. Although, it is impossible to define a start date on which this
kind of non-renewable biomass began to be applied, there are many

CGM Ceramic VCS Project Description
documents to prove that wood has been used for thermal energy generation
before 1989 as requested in the applied methodology. Firewood used to be
the most employed source of primary energy until the decade of 1970, when
the petroleum started to supply the majority of Brazilian’s energy
needs 21 . Moreover the Brazilian’s Energy and Mine Ministry has been
monitoring every energetic sectors of Brazil since 1970, and firewood
appears over the years monitored as a significant source of thermal energy
for ceramic sector 22 . Especially in the ceramic sector, the use of
firewood is visible non-renewable and unsustainable, involving negative
environmental impacts associated23. This way, it can be concluded that
non-renewable biomass has been used since 31 December 1989 or previously.
The Babaçu coconut husk and forest residues (sawdust) are agro-industries
residues, so they are considered renewable according to option V of
methodology definition of renewable biomass: “The biomass is the non-
fossil fraction of an industrial or municipal waste”.
The municipal garden's residues are considered renewable biomass according
to option V of methodology definition of renewable biomass: “The biomass
is the non-fossil fraction of an industrial or municipal waste”. Since
it’s a municipal waste from the city of Crato, which is located in the
ceramic region.
The cashew tree pruning is considered renewable according to option II,
as soon as it fits all the assumptions below:
“The biomass is woody biomass and originates from croplands and/or
grasslands where:
(a) The land area remains cropland and/or grasslands or is reverted to
forest; and
(b) Sustainable management practices are undertaken on these land areas
to ensure in particular that the level of carbon stocks on these land
areas does not systematically decrease over time (carbon stocks may
temporarily decrease due to harvesting); and
(c) Any national or regional forestry, agriculture and nature
conservation regulations are complied with.”
Residues from cashew trees fits all the three options above since just
residues from the croplands area are utilized, i.e. the area remains a
cropland with the use of the biomass. Moreover, the areas where the cashew
trees fallows sustainable management practices, according to is
cultivation and harvest techniques, where the pruning of cashew trees is
necessary in order to allow an appropriate formation of the tree and
maintaining favorable conditions for the next harvest period24. This way,
in cashew cultivation must be cut undesirable branches of the cashew
trees.
Besides, Brazilian’s production presents the tendency of increasing so
far, carried by the new technologies utilized and the higher national and
international demand of cashew nuts25. This way, the Brazilian sources of
residues from cashew trees will increase following the Brazilian
production, due the fact that cashew cultivation requests it.

2.2 Justification of the choice of the methodology and why it is applicable to the
project activity:
The applicability criteria of the methodology AMS-I.D. and their relevance with respect to the
project activity under consideration are addressed as follows:
1. “This category comprises renewable energy generation units, such as photovoltaics,
hydro, tidal/wave, wind, geothermal and renewable biomass, that supply electricity to and/or
displace electricity from an electricity distribution system that is or would have been supplied
by at least one fossil fuel fired generating unit.”
The project activity involves the setting up of wind farms, i.e., renewable generating units of
cumulative generation capacity 15 MW to harness a renewable source of energy (wind power
potential) and export the generated electricity to the fossil fuel dominated electricity
generation and distribution system, i.e. the NEWNE Regional Electricity Grid of India3. In
the process, an equivalent quantum of electricity that would have been generated by the grid
in line with the grid electricity generation mix is displaced by the project activity. The carbon
intensity of the fossil-fuel dominated generation mix of the grid is evident from the following
break-up of various types of energy sources constituting the grid-mix contributing electricity
to the NEWNE Grid system, as shown in Table below Mar 05.
3 The NEWNE Regional Electricity Grid of India is primarily constituted of fossil- fuel fired thermal power plants. Refer to CO 2

VCS Project Description Template
(Source :http://www.cea.nic.in/ceaarchive/body/Reports/Executive%20Summary/2006/2006_06/8.pdf
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
2. “If the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a
wind/diesel unit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small-scale CDM project activity applies
only to the renewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel, the capacity of the
entire unit shall not exceed the limit of 15MW”.
The project activity involves only wind power generation. The gross wind power generation
capacity of the project activity is 15 MW which is meets the eligibility limit of small-scale
CDM project activity, as stipulated in the applicability criterion under consideration.
Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
3. “Combined heat and power (co-generation) systems are not eligible under this
category”
The project activity involves generation of electricity only through WTGs and is not a co-
generation system. Hence the project activity complies with this criterion.
4. “In the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy
generation units at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added capacity of the

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
The average lifetime of the WTGs under project activity is around 25 years as per the equipment
supplier specifications and APERC Tariff order. The plant load factor (PLF) 23% for the project
site is sourced from by third party wind resource assessment.
In the absence of the project activity the equivalent amount of electricity would have been
generated from the southern grid, which is predominantly based on fossil fuels1, hence baseline
scenario of the project activity is the grid based electricity system, which is also the pre-project
scenario.
Apart from the above technical specification of WTGs, the connectivity of all the WTGs is to a
central Monitoring Station (CMS) through high speed WLAN modem or fibre optic cable, which
helps in providing real time status of the turbine at CMS with easy GUI (Graphical User Interface)
and ability to monitor the functioning of the turbine from CMS.
A Supervisory Control & Data Acquisition System (SCADA) provides a graphical representation of
data providing ease to understand the behaviour of WTGs, long time data storage facility, access
to daily generation report and power curve related information & helps to analyze the problem
with graphical tools offline as well as online. The other specifications include a safety system with
instrumentation for tracking individual functions of the wind electric generator.
1.9 Project Location
Project site is well connected by district and village roads to the nearest town. The physical
address and geographic co-ordinate of WTGs under the project is provided below.

1.10 Conditions Prior to Project Initiation
The project activity is a Greenfield activity that is the installation of new 4.2 MW (2*2100KW
WTG) wind energy based plant for generating electricity. In the absence of the project activity, the
equivalent qunatity of electricity would have been generated by grid mix power plant connected to
southern grid.
1.11 Compliance with Laws, Statutes and Other Regulatory Frameworks
The relevant national laws and regulation pertaining to generation of energy are:
• Electricity Act 2003
• National Electricity Policy 2005
• Tariff Policy 2006
Power generation using wind energy is not a legal requirement or a mandatory option. There are
state and sectoral policies, framed primarily to encourage wind power projects. These policies
have also been drafted realizing the extent of risks involved in the projects and to attract private
investments. As per enviromental act the proposed project activity does not require to carry out
environmental impact assessment. The PP has secured all necessary regulatory and statutory
clearances for WTGs under.
The Indian Electricity Act, 2003 (May 2007 Amendment) does not influence the choice of fuel
used for power generation.
There is no legal requirement on the choice of a particular technology for power generation. The
project activity conforms to all the applicable laws and regulations in India

2.2 Applicability of Methodology
The methodology AMS-III.R comprises recovery and destruction of methane from manure and
wastes from household agricultural activities that would be decayed anaerobically emitting
methane to the atmosphere in the absence of the project activity. This project is belongs to the (b)
of 1st applicability criteria of AMS III.R because the management practice of a biogenic waste or
raw material was changed from deep pit storage to biogas digesters. The methodology AMS-I.C
comprises renewable energy technologies that supply individual households with thermal energy
that displaces fossil fuels.
The proposed project activity will change the existing swine manure treatment at the household
level from deep pits to household biogas digesters. The biogas digesters provide biogas for
cooking and other heating needs for households, replacing the fossil fuel coal. The project will
reduce CH4 emission from the slurry stored in a deep pit, and reduce CO2 emission from burn of
coal.
Therefore, this project can satisfy the applicable conditions of the methodologies AMS-III.R
(version 03) and AMS-I.C (version 19) as follows in Table B1 and Table B2.

1992,methodology,"B.2 Justification of the choice of the methodology and why it is applicable to the
project activity:
>>
The project activity meets all the applicability conditions of the approved consolidated
methodology ACM0002, as described below.
a) The project activity is a grid-connected renewable power generation project
constructed as a run-of-the-river hydropower project without any reservoir.
b) The geographic and system boundaries for the relevant electricity grid are clearly
identified and information on the characteristics of the grid is available.
As explained earlier, the project activity is envisaged across the Gaganchukki Branch of the
river Cauvery. The water from the branch is diverted using a diversion structure to power
canal and then to the powerhouse. The water will be fed back to branch through the tailrace
canal. The diversion structure does not result in storage of water or does not effect in any way
the volumes of existing reservoirs that are existing downstream of the project.
The relevant electricity grid system is Southern Region comprising the state level subsystems
of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Kerala and Puducherry. The electricity system is
managed by Southern Regional Electricity Board (SREB). Central Electricity Authority
(CEA), a central level authority for electricity in India, monitors power generation from all
plants connected to the grid system. Hence, the geographic and system boundaries of the
southern regional grid system can be clearly identified.
Hence, the approved consolidated methodology is applicable to the project activity.",521,521_proj_desc_521_19apr2008.pdf,methodology,{'project_methodologies': ['ACM0002']},What is the methodology of this project?,{'project_methodologies': ['ACM0002']}
