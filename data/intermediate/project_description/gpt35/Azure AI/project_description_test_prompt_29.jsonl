The grouped project activity is in line with the eligibility conditions\nof the AFOLU requirements as the project activity increase the carbon sequestration through the\nplanting of multiple plant and tree species; the project activity includes timber harvesting in their\nmanagement plan and the lands weren\u2019t native ecosystems. As a grouped project activity, the\nfuture plantations of the project will be in line with the eligibility requirements of the VCS. The\nproject activity does not intervene in native ecosystems. None of the sites are cleared of native\necosystems within the 10-year period prior to the project start date for the purpose of creating\ncarbon credits. The project activity has included timber harvesting in their management plan.\nIt is demonstrated and justified how the project activity meets each of the applicability conditions\nof the methodology AR-ACM003, Ver. 2.0.\nScope: This methodology excludes from its scope the land that falls into the category of wetland.\nCriterion-1: The land subject to the project activity does not fall in wetland category.\nAs per the IPCC GPG LULUCF 2003, wetlands are defined as lands that are covered or\nsaturated by water for all or part of the year (e.g., peatland) and that does not fall into the forest\nland, crop land, grass land or settlements categories including reservoirs, natural rivers and\nlakes. The project activity sites consist of fallow agricultural land and wasteland does not cover\nany wetlands. Hence, this criterion is applicable.\nCriterion-2: Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10 per\ncent of area in each of the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project\nboundary:\n(i) Land containing organic soils;\n(ii) Land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and receives\ninputs listed in appendices 1 and 2 to this methodology.\nSoil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not, in any case, cover more than 10% of\nthe total area. The land subjected to the project activity does not contain organic soil and there\nwere no land management practices carried out before the project.\nCriterion-3: A project activity applying this methodology shall also comply with the applicability\nconditions of the tools contained within the methodology and applied by the project activity.\n(a) VCS tools & requirements:\n24 https:\/\/cdm.unfccc.int\/methodologies\/DB\/C9QS5G3CS8FW04MYYXDFOQDPXWM4OE\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 39\n\n[['Source', None, 'Gas', 'Included?', 'Justification\/Explanation'], ['enilesaB', 'Aboveground\\nbiomass', 'CO2', 'Yes', 'This is the major carbon pool subjected to\\nproject activity.'], [None, None, 'CH4', 'No', 'Not included in carbon pool'], [None, None, 'N2O', 'No', 'Not included in carbon pool'], [None, None, 'Other', 'No', 'Not included in carbon pool'], [None, 'Belowground\\nbiomass', 'CO2', 'Yes', 'This is the major carbon pool subjected to\\nproject activity.'], [None, None, 'CH\\n4', 'No', 'Not included in carbon pool'], [None, None, 'N O\\n2', 'No', 'Not included in carbon pool'], [None, None, 'Other', 'No', 'Not included in carbon pool'], ['tcejorP', 'Aboveground\\nbiomass', 'CO\\n2', 'Yes', 'This is the major carbon pool subjected to\\nproject activity.'], [None, None, 'CH\\n4', 'No', 'Not included in carbon pool'], [None, None, 'N O\\n2', 'No', 'Not included in carbon pool'], [None, None, 'Other', 'No', 'Not included in carbon pool'], [None, 'Belowground\\nbiomass', 'CO\\n2', 'Yes', 'This is the major carbon pool subjected to\\nproject activity.'], [None, None, 'CH\\n4', 'No', 'Not included in carbon pool'], [None, None, 'N O\\n2', 'No', 'Not included in carbon pool'], [None, None, 'Other', 'No', 'Not included in carbon pool']]\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\n\uf0b7 VT0001 Tool for demonstration and assessment of Additionality in VCS Agriculture,\nForestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) Project Activities, Version 3.0;\n\uf0b7 AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool, Version 4.0\n\uf0b7 Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in A\/R CDM\nproject activities\n\uf0b7 Tool for estimation of change in soil organic carbon stocks due to the implementation of\nA\/R CDM project activities\n\uf0b7 Calculation of the number of sample plots for measurements within A\/R CDM project\nactivities\n3.1.3 Project Boundary\nDefine the project boundary and identify the relevant GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs for the\nproject and baseline scenarios (including leakage if applicable).\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 40","output":"{'project_methodologies': ['AR-ACM0003']}"}

According to measurements it has\nbeen determined that the annual average wind speed at the height of 70m is 6.50 m\/s. Taking into account\nthe effects of the frictional drag of the terrain, the average wind speed at the height of hub (55m and 65m) is\n6.23 m\/s and 6.49 m\/s (calculated with the WasP software) and the average wind power density is between\n294W\/m2 and 325W\/m2.\nBased on the conditions of wind resource it is therefore proposed to use advanced technology to optimise the\npower generation efficiency at lower wind-speeds. The project therefore proposes to make use of IEC III\nresource technology that is more efficient at lower wind speeds.

Without the\nimplementation of this project, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the\nscenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario.\nSince the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of\nmethane (CH ) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is 4\nmore beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction\nthan the continuously flooded.\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results\nin not only large amount of methane (CH ) emissions but also low rice productivity by 4\nreplacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens\nthe period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH emission 4\ncan be declined by an average of 48%2 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an\nestimated amount of GHG emission reduction 9.27 tCO e\/ha for double-cropping rice is 2\nexpected.

One such source is nitrogen-fixing microbes that convert\natmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, a plant available form of N, supplying N to the plant during\nthe most critical stages of growth. This treatment offers unique advantages over synthetic\nnitrogen fertilizer, including consistency (microbes do not leach or volatilize during weather\nevents), accessibility (biological nitrogen fixation occurs on the root of the crop, making N\nreadily available to the plant), and resiliency (microbes produce nitrogen throughout the\ngrowing season, matching N availability to crop needs).\nLocation: This project will include farms in the U.S. Corn Belt. Please see appendix A for\nspecific geographies.\nGHG Reductions & Removals: Biological nitrogen-fixation for cereal crops is a new\ntechnology, brought to market by Pivot Bio in 2019. These microbes are the first nitrogen\nsource that can replace synthetic nitrogen fertilizer by fixing and supplying N to cereal crops,\nallowing growers within the project boundary to apply less synthetic nitrogen on the field. Lower\napplications of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer have the well-documented impact of reducing nitrous\noxide (N O) emissions, and in certain cases, growers may also see a reduction in additional 2\nGHG emissions from reduced equipment use. In total, the GHG emission reductions from\nreduced synthetic fertilizer use will be used to generate credits.\nCurrent Practice: Prior to the introduction of nitrogen-fixing microbes for cereal crops (and\nstill the case for farms that have not adopted the technology), synthetic nitrogen fertilizer is\napplied to fields with the expectation that half or more of the applied nitrogen will be lost to\nweather events. Synthetic nitrogen fertilizer is lost as nitrous oxide both directly from the soil\nand indirectly as nitrate leached into waterways, generating GHG emissions. Nitrogen-fixing\nmicrobes supply nitrogen the crop needs without the typical loss of N attributed to bulk\napplication of synthetic N fertilizer.

The primary purpose of the project is to generate electricity to the Lao Power Grid.\nTotal installed capacity of the project is 10.50 MW, provided by two (2) Horizontal Francis\nturbines. The scheduled commissioning date of the project activity is expected to be on 08-\nAugust-2024 with an average annual output of 44,270 MWh.\nThe project is expected to constantly contribute clean energy to the Lao Power Grid. It not only\nconforms to the present situation, but also can adapt to future changes in the electricity market.\nThe baseline scenario of the project is continuation of the present situation, i.e., electricity\nsupplied from the power grid. By displacing part of the power generated by thermal power plants,\nthe project is therefore expected to reduce an average annual emission reduction of 20,550\ntCO e per year with a total emission reduction of 143,851 tCO e during the first crediting period. 2 2\nThe project is not only supplying renewable electricity to grid, but also producing positive\nenvironmental and economic benefits and also, promotes the local sustainable development in\nthe following aspects:\n\u2022 During the construction period, plenty of job opportunities were provided to local\nresidents.\n\u2022 The infrastructure has been greatly improved. The enhancement of the transportation\nand electricity system brings substantial benefits to local villagers.\n\u2022 The use of fossil fuel will be reduced because of displacement by grid electricity, this\nreduces the fossil fuel-based electricity generation.\n\u2022 Provide clean & cheap electricity in this region, promote the sustainable development\nin this region and slowing down the increasing trend of GHG emissions.\n1.2 Audit History\nNot Applicable, as the project is currently in the listing stage.\n1.3 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\n4\n\n[['', 'Sectoral scope1', '', '', '01-Energy Industries (Renewable\/non-renewable sources)', ''], ['', 'Project activity type', '', '', 'Renewable Energy Project', '']]\n[['', 'Sectoral scope', '', '', 'NA', ''], ['', 'AFOLU project category2', '', '', 'NA', ''], ['', 'Project activity type', '', '', 'NA', '']]\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.3\nThis project is not an AFOLU project and is not a grouped project.\n1.4 Project Eligibility\nGeneral eligibility\nThe project is a 10.50 MW small scale grid connected electricity generation project using hydro\npower in Lao PDR. which is least developed country (LDC)3 as per the United Nation (UN).
