It was\nstarted with the mission of getting subsistence farmers out of poverty by building a profitable forestry\nbusiness that connects thousands of small-scale tree farmers to high-value wood markets.\nKomaza\u2019s business model is unique in its promotion of decentralized smallholder forestry. Komaza works\nwith smallholder farmers on their own land, where the land remains under the ownership of the farmers,\nbut the trees are owned by Komaza, and the benefits are shared between the parties. Collectively, small-\nscale farmers possess enough land and labor resources to plant billions of trees, overcoming major barriers\nto commercial forestry in Kenya (namely access to land and high establishment cost), while developing\nparticularly strong environmental benefits.\n\u25cf Scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project\nKomaza currently operates in two main locations, Coastal Kenya within Kilifi and Kwale counties, and\nCentral Kenya within Nyandarua county.\nIn Coastal Kenya, a large share of the native ecosystem has already been lost, leaving a mosaic of lowland\nforest patches, bushlands and scrublands with mostly infertile soil. Farmers aren\u2019t used to planting trees,\nand terrestrial reforestation and afforestation efforts remain limited due to difficulties associated with the\nfragmented nature of the landscape and insufficient access to finance. Because of the increasing pressure\nfrom local economic development, in the absence of intervention it is likely that further land degradation\nwould occur, causing significant loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services.\nIn Central Kenya, a more fertile area than the coast, there is also environmental degradation caused by\nland use changes and poor agricultural practices. Some farmers already plant trees for timber and\nfuelwood, but not at a pace or in a way that can reverse the ongoing degradation, with large amounts of\nagricultural land still left fallow. In the absence of new large-scale, attractive tree growing initiatives, it is\nlikely that further land degradation would occur and increase the vulnerability of smallholder farmers to the\nimpacts of climate change.\n\u25cf How Komaza generates GHG emission removals\nKomaza works with smallholder farmers who own degraded, unused, or sub-utilized plots, to turn this land\ninto productive forestry (afforestation). Komaza provides high-quality seedlings, training, as well as tree\nmanagement and harvest services to farmers. No upfront cash investment nor forestry knowledge is\nrequired to participate. Farmers receive a fair payment at harvest, based on the volume of wood removed\nfrom the farm and the prevailing market prices.\n12\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3\n\n[['', None, None, None, None], ['', 'Project Scale', None, None, ''], ['', None, None, None, None], ['Project', None, '', None, None], [None, None, '', 'X', ''], [None, None, '', None, None], ['Large project', None, '', None, None], [None, None, '', None, None], [None, None, '', None, None]]\n[['', None, None, 'Komaza'], ['', 'Organization name', '', None], ['', None, None, None], ['', None, None, 'H\u00e9lo\u00efse Zimmermann'], ['', 'Contact person', '', None], ['', None, None, None], ['', None, None, 'Carbon Finance Manager'], ['', 'Title', '', None], ['', None, None, None], ['', None, None, '24 Chalbi Drive Nairobi, Kenya'], ['', 'Address', '', None], ['', None, None, None], ['', None, None, '+254 713 942 780'], ['', 'Telephone', '', None], ['', None, None, None]]\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nAs of 2022, Komaza has established over 8,000 ha of new commercial forests and has planted close to 7\nmillion trees involving over 25,000 smallholder farmers. Three species are planted namely the fast-growing\nhybrid Eucalyptus grandis x camaldulensis, Eucalyptus grandis and indigenous species Melia volkensii, all\nsuited for the local climatic conditions and product needs.\nThe project will include all Komaza\u2019s planting since 2017 and future planting in Kenya. Over the lifetime of\nthe project (30 years) Komaza will plant at least 45,088 ha of smallholder plantations with rotations of 8, 10\nand 15 years for Eucalyptus (Central), Eucalyptus (Coast) and Melia (Coast) respectively, both in replanting\nand coppicing management regimes. This grouped project will result in an annual average GHG removal\nof 212,780 tons over 30 years and a total GHG removal (long-term average) of 6,383,391 tCO2e.\n\u25cf Komaza\u2019s climate, community and biodiversity objectives\nCo-benefits from this project include, but not limited to:\n- New income opportunity for smallholder farmers, which doesn\u2019t require any cash investment and\nis climate-resilient\n- Dissemination of forestry knowledge and skills in the communities, including better environmental\nawareness\n- Women empowerment through innovative contract and payment model\n- Increased forest cover in a landscape that provides habitat for many species\n- Reduced land degradation and desertification\n- Reduced pressure on natural forests and other protected ecosystems\n2.1.2 Project Scale\n2.1.3 Project Proponent (G1.1)\n13\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3","output":"{'project_name': 'Komaza Smallholder Farmer Forestry Kenya', 'project_summary': 'Komaza is a social enterprise founded in 2006 in Coastal Kenya.

Wood from\ndeforestation is delivered and utilized in the ceramic facilities and\nthis non renewable biomass is offered with low prices.\nAlthough firewood from deforested areas used has been for many decades as\nfuel in Brazil, it is impossible to define a start date on which this\nkind of non-renewable biomass began to be applied. Firewood used to be\nthe most employed source of primary energy until the decade of 1970, when\nthe petroleum started to supply the majority of Brazilian\u00b4s energy\nneeds 10 . Moreover the Brazilian\u00b4s Energy and Mine Ministry has been\nmonitoring every energetic sectors of Brazil since 1970, and firewood\nappears over the years monitored as a significant source of thermal\nenergy for ceramic sector11.\nAccording to Seye (2003) 12 , in Brazil, the red ceramic devices are\nproduced through an inefficient and traditional process using wood\nwithout forest management to generate thermal energy. In this industry\nsegment the use of wood represents about 98% of the total fuel employed\nstimulating\nTherefore, the employment of this fuel stimulates the increase in\nBrazilian deforestation rates. The baseline identified for this project\nactivity is the employing of a total of 22,800 m3 of native wood per year\nto provide thermal energy to the ceramics\u2019 kilns.\nThe project activity focuses on the use of wood from sustainable forest\nmanagement plan areas, sawdust, Algaroba wood, residues form cashew tree\nand baba\u00e7u coconut husk as renewable biomasses for energy supply. The\nentrepreneur aims to use municipal garden's residues and elephant grass\nin the future.\n1.8 A description of how the project will achieve GHG\nemission reductions and\/or removal enhancements:\nThe emission reductions will be achieved by displacing the use of wood\nfrom areas with no sustainable forest management to provide thermal\nenergy in the ceramic companies. Therefore, the emissions launched during\nthe combustion of wood were not compensated by the replanting.

Prior to the project, the steam requirement did not exist for the\nsteam customers because those facilities started concurrently with project and hence the project\ndoes not displace any existing steam generation project. Hence, there was no generation of rice\nhusk that is used in the project.\nThe excess rice husk available in the region is subjected to unplanned disposal including\ndumping and\/or burning in an uncontrolled manner. As per current practice in the region, rice\nhusk from different plants in the area are normally dumped in an unplanned manner and\/or burnt.\nSome of the rice husk decays and the rest are taken away by local villagers for various domestic\nuses such as poultry feed, etc. The project, therefore, does not create any GHG emissions for\nsubsequent removal.\n1.11 Compliance with Laws, Statutes and Other Regulatory Frameworks\nThe project is in compliance with existing local regulation6 encouraging implementation of rice\nhusk based thermal energy production. The local environmental regulations provide requirements\nfor pollution control from the project. The PP has assessed if there are any significant\nenvironmental impacts due to the project and concluded there are not any such impacts.

The farmers plant trees on \ntheir land and retain ownership of the trees and their products. They receive training from TIST and a \nshare of the carbon revenues from CAAC.  \nTIST empowers Small Groups of 6 to 12 subsistence farmers in India, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda to \ncombat the devastating effects of deforestation, poverty and drought. Combining sustainable \ndevelopment with carbon sequestration, TIST already supports the reforestation and biodiversity efforts of \nover 91,000 subsistence farmers. Carbon credit sales generate participant income and provide project \nfunding to address agricultural, HIV\/AIDS, nutritional and fuel challenges. As TIST expands to more \ngroups and more areas, it ensures more trees, more biodiversity, more climate change benefit and more \nincome for more people. The carbon credits create a new \u2018virtual\u2019 cash crop for the participants, who gain \nall the direct benefits of growing trees and also receive quarterly cash stipends based on the GHG \nbenefits created by their efforts. The maturing trees and Conservation Farming will provide additional \nsustainable benefits that far exceed the carbon payments. These include improved crop yield, improved \nenvironment, and marketable commodities such as fruits, nuts, and honey.  \nTIST provides an administrative backbone that supplies training in building nurseries, tree planting, \nConservation Farming, building fuel-efficient stoves and malaria and HIV\/AIDS prevention. Part of the \nbackbone is a two-way communications network that includes newsletters, weekly meetings at the Small \nGroup level, monthly meetings where groups of Small Groups receive training, periodic seminars at the \nnational level and an award-winning monitoring system based on hand-held computers and GPS. TIST is \navailable to everyone and all are considered equal. The rotating leadership and the Small Group rules \nempower women and the undereducated. Those who are the most successful, regardless of education \nlevels or gender, become mentors and leaders. This project seeks to maximize environmental and social \nimpact while supporting and improving existing agricultural activities. Planting trees on privately owned \nfarms in conjunction with agricultural activities is minimally disruptive, resulting in virtually no leakage or \nbaseline emissions. The project will continue to monitor the potential for leakage in the regular \nimplementation of baseline surveys which assess the presence of displacement and other activities that \ncould result in leakage. TIST representatives will regularly conduct site visits to farms to monitor farmers\u2019 \nactivities. Further discussion of leakage management can be found in section 3.2.3. Similarly, TIST will \nassess non-permanence factors through regular site visits. By aiming to visit farms once every 18 months \nthe project will collect substantial amounts of data to make assessments of any losses and corresponding \nrisk factors.  \nThis monitoring report is for a subset of the TIST project in Kenya and applies to 1,567 Small Groups, \n10,007 farmers, 6,321 project areas and 2,293.154 ha. The main species planted are Gravellia, Cyprus, \nand Acacia. TIST farmers use a mosaic restoration approach, planting on thousands of individual farms \nspread across the landscape.  \n \nTIST estimates this project will result in as annual average GHG removal of 98,967 tCO2 and a total GHG \nremoval of 5,937,992 tCO2.  \nThe total GHG emission removals generated in this monitoring period is 28,467 tCO2, and the net \nremovals is 24,560 tCO2.

Without the implementation of this project, the continuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic decomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase and methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\\r\\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results in not only large amount of methane (CH4) emissions but also low rice productivity by replacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens the period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 3.58 tCO2e\/ha for single-cropping rice is expected. Annual average estimation of GHG emission reductions from the project activity is 57,288 tCO2e\/year, and the total GHG emission reductions are 572,880 tCO2e during the fixed 10 years crediting period.\\r\\nThis project aims to:\\r\\n- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;\\r\\n- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;\\r\\n- Increase in the number of individuals who have relevant skills due to diversified educational opportunities from trainings;\\r\\n- Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers.', 'project_state_province': 'Sichuan Province', 'project_country': 'China', 'project_latitude': 31.38, 'project_longitude': 106.7}"}

The biogas power plant is owned by Liziz Biogas Sdn Bhd as a subsidiary of Mestron Holdings Berhad, with technical guidance from True Eco Sdn Bhd and carbon strategy provided by CarbonTrace Sdn Bhd. The purpose of the Project is to recover biogas produced during the POME treatment process, which, if not recovered, would be released into the atmosphere, thereby contributing to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The biogas power plant utilizes POME from Liziz Plantation Sdn. Bhd.'s palm oil mill as its feedstock. The proposed project activity includes the installation of an anaerobic wastewater treatment facility that employs Complete Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) biogas reactor technology. The biogas recovered is expected to be used for:  a. electricity generation for own consumption, and b. electricity generation to the national grid, with the option of flaring for any excess quantity generated. GHG emission reductions are achieved by capturing biogas from POME treatment, which prevents its release into the atmosphere and substitutes grid electricity with renewable energy. Prior to the project's implementation, the baseline POME treatment method would involve a series of cascading open lagoon ponds, and electricity needs were met through conventional means, which involved consuming non-renewable energy sources or energy from the national grid, primarily dependent on fossil fuels.

During this phase, the\nindigenous councils will work on their land use plans, capacity building, set-up of patrolling bodies,\nconservation areas demarcation, and internal agreements for benefit distribution. Also, it will be used to\nallow for implementation of productive activities, revenue sharing, and re-investment agreements. This\nphase will consolidate the REDD+ project activities with the community, and will help build capacity for\nMRV.\n\u2022 Phase 2 (8-30 years), to continue with the implementation of the project activities. Years 11 and 21 will be\nused to re-assess the baseline situation regarding carbon, deforestation and degradation drivers, and\nproject activities, and to define needs for readjustment. Land use plans and progress will be assessed and\ndiscussed at the assembly level.\n1.7.2 IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE\n1.7.3 BASELINE REASSESSMENT\nThe project baseline will be reassessed in years 10 and 20.\n1.7.4 ARR\/IFM HARVESTING PERIODS\nNot applicable.

Specifically, the project is of the\nv3.0 55\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION\nVCS Version 3, CCB Standards Third Edition\n\u201cAvoided Unplanned Deforestation & Degradation\u201d (AUDD) project category. The project will not pursue IFM nor\nANR activities in any of the project areas. Some of the project activities do occur on wetlands; however the specific\ncarbon pools and GHG sources have not been accounted for as their exclusion leads to conservative estimates of\nthe total GHG emission reductions. The methodology VM0006 establishes that both below ground biomass and\nsoil organic carbon are optional carbon pools and may be conservatively excluded.\n2.1.1 GROUPED PROJECT\nThis project is not a grouped project; nor will the project use the programmatic approach. All of the project area,\ncommunities and activities, and associated risks, intended to be part of the project are included as part of the\ncurrent scale of the project.\n2.1.2 PROJECT ELIGIBILITY\nThe project meets all of the requirements set forth in the VCS Standard v3.4, issued October 8th 2013, and the VCS\nAFOLU Requirements v3.4, issued October 8th 2013.\nThe project further complies with all of the rules and requirements of the Climate, Community and Biodiversity\nStandard (CCBS), Third Edition, December 2013.\nThe project also complies with all relevant legislation as specified in Section 3.\n2.1.3 METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS\nThe project is using VCS-approved methodology VM0006, \u201cMethodology for Carbon Accounting for Mosaic and\nLandscape-scale REDD Projects v2.1\u201d for quantification of GHG emission reductions and removals generated in\nmosaic and landscape scale REDD+ projects.\nThe project applies the methodology VM0006 in full (See Section 4). It further uses the VT0005 Tool for measuring\naboveground live forest biomass using remote sensing, designed by Terra Global Capital. The tool provides a\nmethod for determining Aboveground Live Forest Biomass (ALFB) through a combination of remote sensing data\nand field measurements to provide an accurate and cost effective estimation of ALFB across varied LULC\nclassification types and broad spatial extents. The tool is intended for use with all approved VCS methodologies\nwithin the scope of Agriculture, Forestry, and Land Use.\nThis methodology also refers to the latest versions of the following approved tools and modules:\n\u2022 CDM A\/R Methodological Tool Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks in dead wood and\nlitter in A\/R CDM project activities.\n\u2022 CDM A\/R Methodological Tool 03 Calculation of the number of sample plots for measurements within A\/R\nCDM project activities.\n\u2022 CDM A\/R Methodological Tool 06 Procedure to determine when accounting of the soil organic carbon\npool may be conservatively neglected.\n\u2022 CDM A\/R Methodological Tool 09 Estimation of GHG emissions related to displacement of grazing\nactivities in A\/R CDM project activity.\n\u2022 CDM Tool for testing significance of GHG emissions in A\/R CDM project activities.\nv3.0 56","output":"{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}"}
