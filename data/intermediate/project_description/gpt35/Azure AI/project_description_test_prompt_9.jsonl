The area is comprised of 60% of dry land mixed forest and 40% of areas designated as\nwetlands. The anticipated selective logging would normally have been undertaken on the dry lands,\nconsisting on an area of 55,950 ha. Those dry lands constitute the project crediting area.\nThe concession is owned by Congolaise Industrielle des Bois (CIB) which has been established as a\ntimber operator in the North of Congo since 1968. The company currently has five active sawmills,\ndryers and moulding units in Pokola and Loundoungou and employs over 900 people permanently\nand more than 100 subcontractors. Four forest concessions are allocated to the CIB and all have\nbeen engaged in sustainable forest management for several years. CIB was the first timber company\nto submit a Forest Management Plan in Congo in 2005 and the first to become FSC certified in 2006.\nThe North Pikounda Unit\u00e9 Foresti\u00e8re d\u2019Exploitation or Forest Exploitation Unit (UFE) was allocated to\nCIB by Ministerial Decree in 2002 and is 92,530 ha (the Project Area).\nThe Project is located in the Northern Congo region of Sangha, of the Northern Congo forest sector.\nThe UFE is part of Pikounda Unit\u00e9 Foresti\u00e8re d\u2019Am\u00e9nagement (UFA)\u2013 a Forest Management Unit\n(FMU), which is divided in two UFEs:\n1. North Pikounda UFE, designated for timber extraction being allocated to CIB, and;\n2. South Pikounda UFE, has been decreed to become \"Tokou-Pikounda Protected\nArea.\u201d\nThe main activity of the North Pikounda REDD+ Project is the cancelation of the planned degradation\nactivities and the decision to instead protect the forest area, while maintaining and protecting the\nbiodiversity of the area. This is particularly important as the Project Area has considerable\nbiodiversity, including one of the largest known lowland gorilla populations in the Congo basin.\nFrom the implementation of the Project, it is estimated that around 4,900,000 tonnes of GHG\nemissions will be avoided which would have been emitted into the atmosphere over a period of 30\nyears in the absence of the Project, not including the Project\u2019s Non-Permanence Risk Buffer amount,\nleakage, if any, which will be accounted for over the life of the project.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nSectoral Scope 14: Agriculture, Forest and other Land Use (AFOLU).\nProject Category: Reduction Emission from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD).\nType of Activity: Improved Forest Management \u2013 Logged to Protected Forests (IFM-LtPF).\nThe project is following the steps of methodology VM0011, \u201cEstimating Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nReductions From Planned Degradation (Improved Forest Management)\u201d developed by Carbon Planet\nto estimate the emissions that would have occurred if the legal harvesting of the North Pikounda UFE\nwould have occurred.\nThe project is not a grouped project.\nNorth Pikounda REDD+ Project: an Improved Forest Management \u2013 Logged to Protected Forests 10\n\n[['Entity', '', 'Congolaise Industrielle des Bois, a', ''], [None, None, 'wholly owned subsidiary of Olam', None], [None, None, 'International Limited', None], ['Role', 'Concession Holder and Project Proponent', None, None], ['Responsible Party', 'Christian Schwarz', None, None], ['Role in the Company', 'General Director CIB', None, None], ['Role in this Project', 'Project Owner', None, None], ['Telephone Number', '+242 06 900 12 50', None, None], ['E-mail Address', 'Christian.schwarz@olamnet.com', None, None], ['Address', 'BP 145\\nBrazzaville\\nR\u00e9publique du Congo', None, None]]\n[['', 'Entity', '', '', 'Olam International Limited', ''], ['Role', None, None, 'Project Proponent', None, None], ['Responsible Party', None, None, 'Lucas Vanderwalt', None, None], ['Role in the Company', None, None, 'Director of Sustainability', None, None], ['Role in this Project', None, None, 'Project Manager', None, None], ['Telephone Number', None, None, '+65 9646 7558', None, None], ['E-mail Address', None, None, 'lucas.vanderwalt@olamnet.com', None, None], ['Address', None, None, '9 Temasek Boulevard,\\n#25-01 Suntec Tower 2\\nSingapore 038989', None, None]]\n[['', 'Entity', '', '', 'Carbon Conservation Pte Ltd', ''], ['Role', None, None, 'Technical Lead in Project Development', None, None], ['Responsible Party', None, None, 'Dorjee Sun', None, None], ['Role in the Company', None, None, 'CEO', None, None], ['Role in this Project', None, None, 'Lead Project Manager', None, None], ['Telephone Number', None, None, '+65 9777 0416', None, None], ['E-mail Address', None, None, 'dorjee@carbonconservation.com', None, None], ['Address:', None, None, '20 Cecil Street', None, None]]\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION\n1.3 Project Proponents\nTable 1 -\u00ad\u2010 Project proponent\n1.4 Other Entities Involved in the Project\nTable 2 -\u00ad\u2010 Other entity involved in the project: Olam\nNorth Pikounda REDD+ Project: an Improved Forest Management \u2013 Logged to Protected Forests 11","output":"{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}"}

{"input":"Question: What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?\n\nContext: \n\n1 PROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nThe project changing from continuously flooded to intermittent flooded condition during rice\ncultivation is conducted in Tongnan District, Chongqing City, where located in southwestern China\nwith a total acreage of 19,190 ha for single-cropping rice. Without the implementation of this\nproject, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the backward\ncontinuously flooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by\ncontinuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under\nflooded condition can emit a large amount of methane (CH4) because of anaerobic\ndecomposition, the intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation,\nproduction increase and less methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\nThe implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir\nconstruction and necessary training for the farmers to help them conduct the intermittent flooded\nwater regime during rice cultivation, which replaces the traditional continuously flooded method.\nControllable irrigation and drainage according to the needs of rice growth can not only save water\nresources, but also reduce methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic\nconditions (flooded state) In this case, the CH4 emission can be declined by an average of 48%.\nHence, with the proposed project activity, an estimated amount of GHG emission reduction 3.12\ntCO2e\/ha for rice is expected.\nThe implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to\n419,076 tCO in the first seven-year period, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 2e\n59,868 tCO 2e.\nThis project aims to:\n- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes.\n- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers.\n- Provide more job opportunities, especially female workers.\n- Use a proportion of benefits to improve the local children\u2019s education.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThe project is developed under VCS scope 14 \u201cAgriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)\u201d\nwith an activity category of Improved Cropland Management (ICM) under Agricultural Land\nManagement (ALM).

The grouped project activity will support the development of new renewable energy projects\n(hydropower, wind, solar etc.) in the target countries (target countries shall be limited to Least Developed\ncountries (listed in appendix 1) in line with section 2.1.1 of the VCS Standard Version 4.2).\nAt present, the singular instance in the grouped project consists of greenfield hydro power project\ninstance in Tanzania owned by Luponde Hydro Limited, a fully owned subsidiary of Rift Valley Energy\n(RVE).\nInstance 1: The project instance 1 is located in Njombe district in Njombe region in Southern\nTanzania. The project instance consists of two run-of-the river hydro sites totalling 3.001 MW\n(1.001 MW + 2.0 MW) installed capacity (Turbine capacity). Phase 1 of the project instance is\nthe Luhololo hydro (on Mwiha stream) with an installed capacity of 1.001 MW which is expected\nto generate approximately 7.1 GWh of electricity annually. Phase 2 of the project instance is the\nIgola hydro (at Lufuo stream) with an expected installed capacity of 2.0 MW1 which is expected\nto generate approximately 14.3 GWh of electricity annually.

The commissioning details\nof these machines are enclosed as Annex I.\nCrediting period start date: 01 May 2007\nVCS Project crediting period: Two renewable crediting period of ten year duration each\nare selected for the project activity, since renewable of the crediting period can be done\natmost one time as project technical lifetime is 20 years, the first crediting period being 1-\nMay-2007 to 30-April-2017 and the second crediting period is from 1 May 2017 to 27\nFeb 2027\n1.7 Conditions prior to project initiation:\nThe project activity is located in the NEWNE grid which is dominated by fossil fuel fired\nthermal power stations. The grid is also doomed by power deficit and hence the addition\nof renewable wind energy generation will help in the sustaining and catering to the power\ndemand. The electricity generated from the wind power project will be used for grid\nsupply which will increase the ration of renewable energy in comparison to non-\nrenewable energy.\nIndia has two regional grids i.e. NEWNE (North, Eastern, Western and North-Eastern)\nand Southern grid. The project is located in the NEWNE region and hence the baseline\nfor the project activity will be emissions that would have occurred by the operation of\ngrid connected power stations and by the addition of new generating stations.

In addition, the construction of the plant will also enable organic waste producers in the\nregion to have their waste disposed at the plant.\nThe expected goals of the project are as follows:\na) Biodigestion of large animal manure will result in the production of biogas, which will be converted\ninto heat and electrical energy in the cogeneration plant. The obtained heat energy will be used for the\nplant's internal needs. The energy can be economically evaluated.\nb) The collected animal manure will be digested and sterilized into a more stable form and will be\ntransformed into a hygienic, odorless, and environmentally friendly fermented product.\nc) The fermented product will contain less odor and more free nitrogen (N) compared to raw manure.\nThe potentially harmful organisms and pathogens that may be present in raw manure will be destroyed.\nd) The recovery of organic waste collected from the environment will be ensured. Organic waste that\ntakes a long time to become stable under external conditions will be used in biogas and fermented\nproduct production with the help of mesophilic bacteria in anaerobic conditions.\ne) CH4 emissions arising from the current manure storage activities will be prevented.\nf) Digested animal waste will be processed into fermented products. The fermented product will contain\nless odor and more free nitrogen (N) compared to raw manure. The potentially harmful organisms and\npathogens that may be present in raw manure will be destroyed.\nThe use of animal manure as raw material in the facility will also contribute to the reduction of\ngreenhouse gas emissions.

Identifying GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs for\nthe baseline scenario and for the project:\nThe spatial extent of the project boundary includes\nthe project site and all power plants connected\nphysically to the Southern China Power Grid (SCPG)\nand the Central China Power Grid (CCPG). The system\nboundary of the proposed project is defined as the\nSCPG and CCPG grids due to following reasons:\n1. China has a layered dispatch system, therefore the\ngrid boundary definitions are determined based\nupon regional grids;\n2. The project power plants are connected to SCPG and\nCCPG. SCPG is a large regional grid, which\nconsists of 4 sub-grids: Guangdong Power Grid,\nGuangxi Power Grid, Yunnan Power Grid and Guizhou\nPower Grid; CCPG likewise consists of 6 sub-grids:\nSichuan Power Grid, Chongqing Power Grid, Hunan\nPower Grid, Jingxi Power Grid, Henan Power Grid\nand Hubei Power Grid.\n3. There is a substantial inter-grid power exchanges\namong the above mentioned sub-grids of SCPG and\nCCPG respectively;\n4. SCPG and CCPG can be clearly identified as\nregional grids and the information on the\ncharacteristics of the grids is publicly\navailable;\n5. There is a guidance from the Chinese CDM\nDesignated National Authority (National Climate\nChange Coordination Office)7 on identifying project\nboundaries and calculating the grid emission\nfactor for specific regional power grids,\nincluding SCPG and CCPG.\n6. Further to this, there are only two hydropower\nplants under the grouped project having reservoirs\n(74_Puti 1 and 75_Puti 2), and the power densities\nof the two individual components (given as the\ntotal capacity (in W) divided by the surface area\nof the full reservoir (in m2)) are shown to be 16\nW\/m2 and 57 W\/m2 (to the nearest whole W\/m2).\nAccording to Annex 5, EB 23, hydroelectric power\nplants with power densities greater than 4 but\nless than 10 W\/m2 can use current approved\nmethodologies but have to use a default emission\nfactor of 90 gCO2eq\/kWh and hydro electric power\nplants with a power density greater than 10 W\/m2\nmay neglect project emissions from the reservoir.\n7 National Climate Change Coordination Office\nhttp:\/\/cdm.ccchina.gov.cn\/WebSite\/CDM\/UpFile\/2008\/20081230102527637.pdf\n43","output":"{'project_methodologies': ['AMS-I.D.']}"}

The conventional Chlorohydrin\nprocess is one of the typical processes in the Propylene Oxide industry that involves\nhydrochlorination process. In the Chlorohydrin process, Propylene (C H ) is combined to 3 6\nhypochlorous acid to form a Chlorohydrin intermediate which is subsequently dechlorohydronated\nto PO and leads to the formation of salts. While in the HPPO process, Propylene and Hydrogen\nperoxide is combined to produce PO.\nThe HPPO technology will be able to reduce GHG emissions and waste generation during PO\nsynthesis compared to the Chlorohydrin process. GHG emissions and waste generation\nreductions are owing to usage of lesser GHG intensive reagents and reduced process energy\nrequirements in the HPPO technology. The project activity is expected to prevent 239,356 tCO 2\nemissions in a year and a total of 2,393,569 tCO for a period of 10 years. 2\nThe new plant will be located within the Asia Industrial Estates (AIE) site near Map Ta Phut,\nRayong, Thailand.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThe project activity falls under the category 5, chemical industry.

Alternative 4: Construction of a power plant using anothe r renewable energy resource with the same \ninstalled capacity or the same annual power output. \n \nGansu Province lacks renewable sources, except wind  resources. According to the Guidance Catalogue \nfor the Renewable Energy Industry Development\n5, other renewable energy generation, like biomass, solar \nPV, wave\/tide, or geothermal resources, are in the ph ase of technical research, and not widely adopted in \nChina. Furthermore, as per the Feasibility Study Repor t, the project is located on a desert plain, so the \nhydropower resources and biomass materials lack in the area6. Therefore, Alternative 4  is not realistic and \ncredible and is not considered further in the assessment of the alternatives.  \n \n Sub-step 1b. Consistency with mandatory laws and regulations:  \nThe Chinese power sector has undergone a transformation to a market-oriented system, therefore \ninvestment in a power generation project is an indi vidual power project developer\u2019s decision based on the \nproject return and risk profile\n7. There are no laws compelling the project developer to develop wind \npower plants, thus Alternatives 1 and 2  identified are in line with all applicable laws and regulations.  \n The main sectoral policy relevant to this Project activity is the Renewable Energy Law of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, which came into effect 1 January 2006 and aims to promote renewable energy in P.R. \nChina. This Law demonstrates the Chinese Government \u2019s commitment to the development of renewable \nenergy as part of the overall energy developmen t strategy, and encourages grid-connected power \ngeneration from renewable sources. Nevertheless, there are no direct incentives such as financial grants, \nhigher tariffs or subsidised loans available for these types of project.  \n \nIn addition to the above, although energy efficiency and renewable energy were included in the agenda \nfor the P.R. China\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (2006-2010), there is no legislative requirement to meet the \nprojections under this Plan\n8.  \n \nAccording to the regulations related to power production in  P. R. China, it is forbidden to build a thermal \npower station with an installed capacity lower than 135 MW9. Therefore, Alternative 3  above is not in line \nwith applicable laws and regulations, and will not be considered further.  \n Finally, Alternative 4  is in compliance with legal and regulat ory requirements; however, it is excluded \nfrom the list of potential baselin e scenarios with reasonable explanation in sub-step 1a. \n \n \n                                                     \n \n5 http:\/\/nyj.ndrc.gov.cn\/zywx\/t20060206_58771.htm \n6 See FSR 3-1. \n7 Source: State Council\u2019s Decision on Reforming Investment Approval Process, 16\/07\/2004.  \n8 See: Point Carbon.
