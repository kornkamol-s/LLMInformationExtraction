The projected emission reductions over the first fixed baseline period\nare summarized in Table 5.1, based on Table 5.18. The figures in Table 5.1 do not include the\ndeduction of a risk buffer. No projections have been attempted beyond this period, since the baseline\nmust in any case be revised at the end of the first ten year crediting period.\nTable 5.1 Estimated emissions reductions for the first fixed baseline period\n5.2 Leakage Management (CL2)\nThe project will implement a series of activities that are designed to reduce the risk of deforestation in\nboth the project area and leakage belt. These project activities are described in detail in Section 2.2\nand Annex 2.1. Table 5.2 summarises the planned activities relevant to leakage management.\nTable 5.2 Summary of leakage management activities\n89"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2019: 2753228.0, 2018: 2743753.0, 2017: 2267670.0, 2016: -194658.0, 2015: 2234785.0, 2014: 2138582.0, 2013: 2083049.0, 2012: 286974.0, 2011: -46899.0}"}]}

Sources and GHG included or excluded within the boundary of the proposed AUD project activity.\n4.5 BASELINE SCENARIO (G2)\nPer VM0015, the most plausible baseline scenario for the project is continued unplanned deforestation\nfor timber, agriculture and grazing activities resulting in removal of old growth\/ primary forest. The\nproject area would be deforested in the absence of the REDD project activity. The deforested areas are\nmosaic in nature.\nDeforestation of old-growth\/ primary forest without logging (A)\nThis option applies because under the mosaic typology of deforestation, the historical changes in land-\nuse are representative of the most likely future changes in land-use.\n4.5.1 WITHOUT-PROJECT SCENARIO FOR COMMUNITIES (CM1)\nFUNDAECO made a scenario exercise based on methods proposed by Richards and Panfil (2011).\nFocal questions were related to access to land and natural resources in both the baseline and project\nscenarios. The focal issues within the community were tied directly to the agents and drivers analysis, as\nis described in section 4.5.3.\nSix main focal issues for communities were identified:\n\uf0b7 Access to land\n\uf0b7 Maize production\/crop lands\n\uf0b7 Access to livelihoods other than maize\n\uf0b7 Rains and water\n\uf0b7 Education\n\uf0b7 Sexual and Reproductive education and health\na. Access to land: access to land is one of the main focal issues, and it means access to croplands,\npasture land, and other natural resources including wood, fuelwood, and water sources. At the\ncommunity level, access to land also means access to sacred sites.\nIn absence of the project, it is expected that communities will continue the fight for the\nestablishment of agricultural and pastoral land in forested areas due to factors such as the\nexpansion of industrial agriculture in previously cultivated low-land areas and increasing\npopulation. However they are aware of the need they have for external support such as\nprovided by FUNDAECO and the project, due that the process for land titling requires the\npreparation of technical and social files, as well as administrative procedures and lobbying with\nFONTIERRAS headquarters in Guatemala. They are aware that without land, there is no food\nsecurity, but they also preview other situations such as migration and social conflict.\nv3.0 91"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2014: 131783.0, 2013: 116852.0, 2012: 99950.0, 2011: 89027.0, 2010: 45013.0}"}]}

(formerly Savita Chemicals Ltd.) in the state of\nKarnataka. The electricity generated is fed to the Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited\n(KPTCL) grid under a long term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA).\n1.3 Estimated amount of emission reductions over the crediting\nperiod including project size:\nTotal Estimated Emission reductions are 177,570 tCO e over the ten year crediting period.

A letter of undertaking from the Project Proponent\nhas been provided to validator, in which PP has declared that GHG reduction credit would be claim up to\nthe date of Registration of project activity in CDM. There would be no double counting of GHG credits, in\nline with the VCS 2007.1 standard and \u201cFurther Guidance for projects that are registered in two GHG\nPrograms\u201d dated 19 March 2008 issued by VCS Association.\n1.4 A brief description of the project:\nThe Project Proponent (PP), Savita Oil Technologies is engaged in the activity of Petroleum based\nspecialty oils business. As an environmentally and socially responsible business group, Savita group has\nalways remained at the forefront of environmental concern. An offshoot of this philosophy is the group's\ninitiative into alternate power generation by using wind turbines to create wind energy. The present project\nactivity is a true example of their environmental awareness.\nThe purpose of the project activity\nThe main purpose of the project activity is to generate electrical energy through sustainable means using\nWind power resources and to contribute to climate change mitigation efforts. In the absence of the project\nactivity, the electricity thus supplied would have been generated through fossil fuel dominated thermal\npower plants. The project activity thus contributes to reduction in specific emissions (emissions of\npollutant) including GHG emissions. The project activity is also responsible for sustainable economic\ngrowth and conservation of environment through use of wind as a renewable source.\nThe Project Activity\nThe project activity deals with generation of electricity using wind energy by 6 Wind Turbine Generators\n(WTGs). The capacity of the project is 8.25 MW that includes 3.75 MW (1250 kW X 3 machines) and\n4.50 MW (1500 kW X 3 machines) located at District Hassan in the state of Karnataka. The electricity\ngenerated is fed to the Karnataka State Electricity Distribution grid\/ Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply\nCorporation Limited (CESC Mysore), a Govt. of Karnataka undertaking. The total installed capacity of the\nproject activity is expected to generate 19152 MWh per annum. The wind power produced, being GHG\nneutral will not only displace thermal power but also will reduce the associated emissions with thermal\npower generation. The annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction through this 8.25 MW wind project is\nestimated to be 17757 tonnes of CO equivalent. 2\n1.5 Project location including geographic and physical\ninformation allowing the unique identification and\ndelineation of the specific extent of the project:\nThe geographical location of the project activity is given in following figures:\n3"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2036: 9245.0, 2035: 9245.0, 2034: 9246.0, 2033: 9246.0, 2032: 9246.0, 2031: 9246.0, 2030: 9246.0, 2029: 9246.0, 2028: 9246.0, 2027: 9246.0, 2026: 12840.0, 2025: 12495.0, 2024: 12495.0, 2023: 121040.0, 2022: 121040.0, 2021: 119911.0, 2020: 120123.0, 2019: 120123.0, 2018: 122892.0, 2017: 122344.0}"}]}

As demonstrated in Section 4.2 of the PD, the change\nin baseline carbons stocks is below the threshold that would require monitoring. Because only\nthe trees planted as part of the project are counted in the estimation of project removals, the\nbaseline carbon stocks are fixed at zero.\n4.2 Project Emissions\nProject emissions are considered zero. As addressed in the PD, this is due to the manner in\nwhich the Project is operated, such as: no vehicles, manual labor conducted by the small-hold\nfarmers on their own land, restrictions on chemical fertilizers, no clearing of baseline trees and\nminimal disturbance of the ground for planting.\nThe calculation of the project removals are detailed by PA in Appendix 14. As noted in section\n2.2.2, some of the PAs were removed this verification period. The Verification 2 removals were\n51,151.0 tonnes. The loss of instances was 38,452.8 tonnes. Additional tonnes sequestered\nduring this period were 76,790.3 bringing the total removals for the PD to 89,488.5 tonnes.\nSubtracting the Verification 2 tonnes gives the 38,337 tonnes in section 4.4.\nProject removals are as calculated in the \"Project Total\" row (bottom of worksheet), \"CO2 in\nStratum (t)\" column, \"Ex-Post Strata\" worksheet of Appendix 14. The total is provided in Section\n4.4, below.\n4.3 Leakage\nFor ex-post leakage, the methodology requires the monitoring of cropland, domesticated grazing\nanimals and domesticated roaming animals displaced by the project activity during the first\ncrediting period.

Due to the fact that timber extraction and commercial logging is largely illegal in baseline\nscenario, little objective evidence is available from which to quantify carbon stored in wood products. As a result,\nthe timber study provides a wide range of estimates based on a limited sample size of families in the project region\nand the socio-economic study appears to under estimate the importance of illegal logging in the project zone when\ncomparted to the results of the timber study and LULC analysis.\nCompared to the varying results of the timber study, the most reliable and objective information about timber\nextraction and wood products is from the historical LULC analysis (see Section 5.3.2). Therefore, the results from\nthe historical LULC analysis were used to estimate wood products as the most accurate approach available. The\nresults from analysis were converted from area-based measurements to wood products-based measurements\nusing conservative assumptions and expert opinion. Therefore, the amount of carbon stored in long-lived wood\nproducts in the baseline scenario is likely over estimated.\nThe analysis of wood products converts predicted changes in area from LULC transitions that generate wood\nproduct products in the baseline scenario in the project area: Primary Forest to Degraded Forest, Primary Forest\nto Pastureland, Primary Forest to Cropland, Degraded Forest to Pastureland and Degraded Forest to Cropland.\nThe conversion from an area-basis to standing biomass basis is made per the following equation:\n\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3f=\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc34\u00d7\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc39 \u00d712\/44 \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3f\nwhere AGL is the metric tonnes of carbon in aboveground living organic matter, AREA is the predicted transition in\nhectares. EF is the emissions factor for aboveground living biomass (tCO2e\/ha) and 12\/44 is the conversion from AGL\ntCO2e to metric tonnes of carbon. This conversion approach is conservative because AGL contains all above-\nground biomass including non-tree biomass which is likely not merchantable.\nThe value for AGL is then adjusted to represent the proportion of above-ground living biomass in merchantable\ntrees. This adjustment was made using a factor of 0.4 which corresponds to 40% of biomass in merchantable\ntrees. This factor is conservative as most of the project area is degraded and likely most of the merchantable\nbiomass has already been extracted with very little low-value product remaining.\nFinally, the inverse of the biomass expansion factor (BEF) is appled to attain the carbon in harvested wood\nproducts. The selected BEF is 3.4 and is based on IPCC default for large trees in broadleaf tropical forests (see\nTable 3A.1.10 of IPCC GPG 2006). Finally, the resultant estimate of harvested wood is converted to long-lived\nwood products per equation 102 of the methodology assuming that all harvested wood products are sawnwood.\nThe selected wood waste fraction is 0.24, oxidization factor is 0.850 and short-lived fraction is 0.2. Assuming that\nall harvested wood products are sawnwood is conservative because sawnwood provides that greatest estimates of\nlong-lived wood products of any wood product category and likely not all wood products from the project area are\nsawnwood.\nThe average carbons stored in long-lived wood products is approximately estimated as 16,310 tCO2e per year.\nThese calculations are presented in Annex V.\nv3.0 1 78"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2043: 367106.0, 2042: 423795.0, 2041: 422423.0, 2040: 420225.0, 2039: 418250.0, 2038: 416310.0, 2037: 414586.0, 2036: 412642.0, 2035: 410981.0, 2034: 408954.0, 2033: 406830.0, 2032: 423203.0, 2031: 439623.0, 2030: 445213.0, 2029: 453404.0, 2028: 454354.0, 2027: 465216.0, 2026: 473431.0, 2025: 462189.0, 2024: 455052.0, 2023: 440693.0, 2022: 434787.0, 2021: 420166.0, 2020: 403034.0, 2019: 425708.0, 2018: 403530.0, 2017: 369660.0, 2016: 299511.0, 2015: 228055.0, 2014: 122646.0, 2013: 2009.0}"}]}

There was concern\nthis could have a material effect on the total carbon calculated. This was tested by looking at the\ntotal number of trees that are affected by this issue. As shown in the \"Misc Calc\" worksheet of\nAppendix 14, this occurrence was determined to be well below the 5% materiality threshold.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the Project meets the precision required by the methodology. In addition, the issue\nregarding one-year-old trees was addressed by assuming one-year-olds had zero biomass. The\nremaining issues of concern were shown to be both individually and cumulatively below the 5%\nmateriality threshold.\n4 QUANTIFICATION OF GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND REMOVALS\n4.1 Baseline Emissions\nNo monitoring of the baseline is required. As demonstrated in Section 4.2 of the PD, the change\nin baseline carbons stocks is below the threshold that would require monitoring. Because only\nthe trees planted as part of the project are counted in the estimation of project removals, the\nbaseline carbon stocks are fixed at zero.\n4.2 Project Emissions\nProject emissions are considered zero. As addressed in the PD, this is due to the manner in\nwhich the Project is operated, such as: no vehicles, manual labor conducted by the small-hold\nfarmers on their own land, restrictions on chemical fertilizers, no clearing of baseline trees and\nminimal disturbance of the ground for planting.\nThe calculation of the project removals are detailed by PA in Appendix 14. As noted in section\n2.2.2, some of the PAs were removed this verification period. The Verification 2 removals were\n118,645 tonnes. The loss of instances was 42,069 tonnes. Additional tonnes sequestered during\nthis period were 195,664 bringing the total removals for the PD to 272,240 tonnes. Subtracting\nthe Verification 2 tonnes gives the 153,595 tonnes in section 4.4.\nProject removals are as calculated in the \"Project Total\" row (bottom of worksheet), \"CO2 in\nStratum (t)\" column, \"Ex-Post Strata\" worksheet of Appendix 14. The total is provided in Section\n4.4, below.\n4.3 Leakage\nFor ex-post leakage, the methodology requires the monitoring of cropland, domesticated grazing\nanimals and domesticated roaming animals displaced by the project activity during the first\ncrediting period. If the indicators were less than 10%, leakage is set to zero. The monitoring\nresults provided in the PD indicated cropland and grazing leakage is below the thresholds that\nrequire further monitoring and that the ex-post leakage can be set at zero.\n4.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\nv3.4 21"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2003: 1245.0, 2004: 3624.0, 2005: 7258.0, 2006: 12208.0, 2007: 18489.0, 2008: 24554.0, 2009: 30289.0, 2010: 31994.0, 2011: 31337.0, 2012: 30862.0, 2013: 29181.0, 2014: 29101.0, 2015: 26827.0, 2016: 25244.0, 2017: 26880.0, 2018: 28197.0, 2019: 25815.0, 2020: 27614.0, 2021: 27674.0, 2022: 28588.0, 2023: 29223.0, 2024: 29223.0, 2025: 29223.0, 2026: 28567.0, 2027: 28574.0, 2028: 27064.0, 2029: 24102.0, 2030: 24005.0, 2031: 21843.0, 2032: 22004.0}"}]}

The area permanently covered is 460 m2. Grass will be planted during the construction period to\nminimise the impact of construction.\n\u2022 The area is not a wetland rich in flora and fauna, and the construction period is only 3 months, so the impact of\nthe construction of the windfarm will have little effect on animals in the area.\n\u2022 The additional water and soil loss caused by the project construction is about 140 tonne. The area will be\nrecovered immediately to minimise the impact.\nThe analysis of the environment impact in operation period\nThe operating noise of the wind turbines is 100dB, dropping to 45dB 250m away.

This term is calculated in equation 57.\n2\n4.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\nUncertainty Factor Calculation\nVM0012 utilized an Uncertainty Factor calculation to account for additional \u2018over-riding\nconfidence deduction as a proxy for collective project uncertainty by assessing statistical\nuncertainty in the forest carbon inventory and associated modeling.\nThe methodology monitoring section specifies that all analysis units will have representation\nby one or more field plots. However, due to the difficulty of determining the independence\nof plot data within individual homogeneous polygons (i.e. a specifically similar forest type,\nsite, and age), it will be necessary to only calculate a single carbon density observation for\neach individual polygon sampled; either through the use of a single plot within that polygon,\nor calculation of the mean of multiple plots within that polygon. Throughout these\ncalculations a plot observation, subscript i, is defined to represent the mean of all plots\nwithin a given polygon.\nThe project-level uncertainty factor is calculated as follows:\nStep 1 \u2013 Calculate the average percent model error (E ) for the project based on the M\naverage area-weighted difference between measured values in monitored plot observations\nand model-predicted values using Equations 60a,b. In the case where analysis units have\nbeen used for stratification, the difference between the plot observation and model-\npredicted value (both expressed on a per hectare basis) for a given analysis unit (y ) is d,h,i\nweighted by the area of its associated analysis unit (A , )(Eq. 60a). The use of an area- PRJ h\nweighting factor places more emphasis on analysis units that represent a relatively larger\nproportion of the total project area.\nE = 100 \u2022 (\u2211 y \/ \u2211(A , \u2022 y )) (60a) M d,h,i PRJ h m,h,i\nWhere,\nThe summation is across all plot observations, i, and across all analysis units , h;\ny = A , \u2022 (y - y ) (60b) d,h,i PRJ h m,h,i p,h,i\nE = Mean model error for the project (%) M\ny = the area-weighted difference between measured and predicted carbon storage in d,h,i\nanalysis unit, h, plot observation, i (t C)\n102\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.0\ny = carbon storage measured in analysis unit, h, plot observation, i (t C ha-1) m,h,i\ny = carbon storage predicted by model for analysis unit , h, plot observation, i (t C ha-1) p,h,i\nA = area of project analysis unit, h (ha) PRJ,h\nStep 2 \u2013 Calculate the inventory error (E) at a 90 percent confidence interval expressed as I\na percentage of the mean area-weighted inventory estimate from the measured plots.\nThis methodology was designed to accommodate complex landscapes consisting of\nhundreds to thousands of polygons, which can be further grouped into analysis units.\nInventory error is estimated based upon the difference between modeled and measured\nvalues for monitoring plots established in polygons or in polygons grouped within analysis\nunits.\nInventory error, E, is estimated by first calculating the standard error of the area-weighted I\ndifferences between the plot observation measurement and the associated model-predicted\ncarbon storage (both on a per hectare basis) for analysis units or polygons. The standard\nerror is then multiplied by the t-value for the 90 percent confidence interval. Finally E is I\nexpressed in relative terms (in Equation 60c) by dividing the 90% confidence interval of the\narea-weighted differences between predicted and measured values in all plots by the area-\nweighted average of the measured values in all monitoring plots.\nE = 100 \u2022 [SE * 1.654 \/ ((1\/N) \u2022 \u2211(A , \u2022 y ))] (60c) I PRJ h m,h,i\nWhere,\nE = Inventory error for the project (%) I\nSE= the project level standard error of the area weighted differences between measured\nplot observation and predicted values of carbon storage.\nN= total number of plot observations in all analysis units or polygons28\n1.654 = the 90% confidence interval t-value\nAll other terms as defined in equation 60a.\nSE = S\/ \u221a N (60d)\nWhere,\n28 For clarity, the plot observation sample size (N) is equivalent to the number of polygons sampled (for\nprojects using either a polygon or analysis unit stratification method). As noted, a single plot observation is\ncreated for each polygon using the mean when there are multiple plots within a polygon. Thus, in some\nsituations the number of actual installed plots may be higher than the number of plot observations (N).\n103"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2088: 124847.0, 2087: 124847.0, 2086: 124847.0, 2085: 124847.0, 2084: 75355.0, 2083: 10230.0, 2082: 10230.0, 2081: 10230.0, 2080: 10230.0, 2079: 10230.0, 2078: 41217.0, 2077: 41217.0, 2076: 41217.0, 2075: 41217.0, 2074: 41217.0, 2073: 74324.0, 2072: 74324.0, 2071: 74324.0, 2070: 74324.0, 2069: 74324.0, 2068: 90160.0, 2067: 90160.0, 2066: 90160.0, 2065: 90160.0, 2064: 90160.0, 2063: 119179.0, 2062: 119179.0, 2061: 119179.0, 2060: 119179.0, 2059: 119179.0, 2058: 117388.0, 2057: 117388.0, 2056: 117388.0, 2055: 117388.0, 2054: 117388.0, 2053: 81649.0, 2052: 81649.0, 2051: 81649.0, 2050: 81649.0, 2049: 81649.0, 2048: 97842.0, 2047: 97842.0, 2046: 97842.0, 2045: 97842.0, 2044: 97842.0, 2043: 158659.0, 2042: 158659.0, 2041: 158659.0, 2040: 158659.0, 2039: 158659.0, 2038: 116801.0, 2037: 116801.0, 2036: 116801.0, 2035: 116801.0, 2034: 116801.0, 2033: 127468.0, 2032: 127468.0, 2031: 127468.0, 2030: 127468.0, 2029: 127468.0, 2028: 134467.0, 2027: 243925.0, 2026: 126403.0, 2025: 131601.0, 2024: 290837.0, 2023: 440911.0, 2022: 430528.0, 2021: 413921.0, 2020: 452612.0, 2019: 315986.0, 2018: 231998.0, 2017: 263116.0, 2016: 414790.0, 2015: 367248.0, 2014: 405719.0, 2013: 371602.0, 2012: 427496.0, 2011: 435748.0, 2010: 439461.0, 2009: 331727.0, 2008: 317823.0}"}]}

Forest plantation for obtaining\ntimber and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are being established since 2016.\nEl Porvenir is in Colombia in the center-east of Meta department, in the municipality of San Martin. The\narea is homogeneous in terms of soil types, climate, land use history and socio-economic conditions.\nForests consist of mostly Eucalyptus pellita and Eucalyptus urograndis plantations and in a lesser extent\narea they have Eucalyptus urophylla. The species of Eucalyptus is managed with a rotation length of 10\nyears. Also, they have plantations of Pinus caribea that is managed with a rotation length of 15-16 years.\nForest project activity is currently in its sixth year after project start-date, and plantation will be completed\nby year ten of project, after the introduction of a new instance to the project. Forests will be replanted\nafter clear-cut harvest but sprout management from stumps is also considered, depending on the genetic\nimprovement obtained in the species at the moment of a new plantation event.\nThe main objectives of the grouped project activity are wood production, land restoration and carbon\nsequestration through afforestation. The project\u201fs crediting period is 100 years from 1 November 2016 to\nthe 1 November of 2116. The farm El Porvenir follow the FSC standard certification as a minimum\npractical condition, ensuring sustainable forest management, positive net impact in social,\nenvironmental, and economic aspects.\nIt must be said that the current project area represents a minor part of the farms owned by\nREFORESTADORA CUMARE SAS. There are around 7,600 ha considered for conservation. This area of\nconservation is composed of native forest, \u201cmorichales\u201d, lagoons, water courses, humid areas, etc., in\nwhich a rich biodiversity of flora and fauna is protected and monitored. There is a strict prohibition to cut\nnative vegetation within the conservation areas, as well as the hunting of wild fauna. For more\ninformation regarding environmental and social benefits, please see section 2 \u201cSafeguards\u201d.\nPlanted forests removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in different carbon pools (living\nabove-ground and below-ground biomass, soil organic carbon, litter, and dead wood). All these carbon\npools will be accounted towards issuance of carbon credits.\n23"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2017: 18370.3589, 2018: 151492.7507, 2019: 415217.3904, 2020: 760205.1767, 2021: 1116954.858, 2022: 1424479.833, 2023: 1667262.966, 2024: 1882704.754, 2025: 2117935.499, 2026: 2431196.301, 2027: 2725596.446, 2028: 2539296.3, 2029: 2429301.288, 2030: 2610414.279, 2031: 2907887.3, 2032: 3292210.103, 2033: 3575741.504, 2034: 3620070.852, 2035: 3453760.874, 2036: 3108650.46, 2037: 2832871.597, 2038: 2651224.496, 2039: 2536566.447, 2040: 2714959.86, 2041: 3006915.315, 2042: 3382385.192, 2043: 3659678.633, 2044: 3700751.479, 2045: 3524497.425, 2046: 3159605.564, 2047: 2882142.532, 2048: 2693260.334, 2049: 2571290.441, 2050: 2741059.767, 2051: 3027140.958, 2052: 3400223.921, 2053: 3672364.326, 2054: 3703552.753, 2055: 3516965.832, 2056: 3162629.603, 2057: 2884416.301, 2058: 2693080.093, 2059: 2571153.336, 2060: 2743418.903, 2061: 3029829.175, 2062: 3399888.901, 2063: 3670092.854, 2064: 3697599.261, 2065: 3519989.871, 2066: 3162194.786, 2067: 2884234.248, 2068: 2695418.01, 2069: 2573511.471, 2070: 2743346.964, 2071: 3029493.888, 2072: 3400844.298, 2073: 3664138.529, 2074: 3697459.403, 2075: 3519554.27, 2076: 3164723.916, 2077: 2886572.164, 2078: 2695300.956, 2079: 2573438.463, 2080: 2745773.169, 2081: 3030448.619, 2082: 3391663.937, 2083: 3663998.274, 2084: 3700189.712, 2085: 3522082.4, 2086: 3164350.649, 2087: 2886454.072, 2088: 2697705.246, 2089: 2575864.668, 2090: 2743966.241, 2091: 3021271.678, 2092: 3394747.527, 2093: 3666728.751, 2094: 3699552.764, 2095: 3521709.124, 2096: 3166945.788, 2097: 2888858.362, 2098: 2697654.321, 2099: 2575291.263, 2100: 2736314.682, 2101: 3024355.268, 2102: 3394253.159, 2103: 3666089.824, 2104: 3702346.554, 2105: 3524303.43, 2106: 3166637.679, 2107: 2888806.336, 2108: 2698326.623, 2109: 2567639.871, 2110: 2737873.723, 2111: 3023859.949, 2112: 3396841.007, 2113: 3668884.614, 2114: 3701773.795, 2115: 3523995.085, 2116: 3169300.222, 2117: 2889478.471, 2118: 2689428.523, 2119: 2567967.784, 2120: 2740134.2, 2121: 2467628.8}"}]}

As demonstrated in Section 3.1 of the VCS PD, the\nchange in baseline carbons stocks is below the threshold that would require monitoring. Because\nonly the trees planted as part of the project are counted in the estimation of project removals, the\nbaseline carbon stocks are fixed at zero.\n3.2.2 Project Emissions\nEmissions Caused by the Project\nThe emissions caused by the Project are considered zero. As addressed in the PD, this is due to\nthe manner in which the Project is operated, such as: no vehicles, manual labor conducted by the\nsmall-hold farmers on their own land, restrictions on chemical fertilizers, no clearing of baseline\ntrees and minimal disturbance of the ground for planting.\nProject Removal Calculations\nThe following provides the step-by-step procedure used to determine the Project GHG removals:\nStep 1.

Conservation activities to protect the Gola forest began\non the ground in 2004 with the deployment of forest rangers but early conservation work was funded\nthrough donor grants. Donor funding ended on 31st July 2012 (see EU contract), at which point\nconservation activities would have halted had the RSPB (one of the partners in the Gola Rainforest\nConservation LG) not stepped in with bridging finances until revenues from the sale of credits are\navailable, under the understanding that this money would slowly be reimbursed by the company (see\ninvoices and financial statements in the confidential folder). The 1st August 2012 is the project start\ndate as from this is the date conservation activities were implemented that lead to the generation of\nGHG emission reductions and removals.\n1.6 Project Crediting Period\nThe project crediting period begins on the 1st August 2012 and ends on the 1st August 2042. The\nproject crediting period is therefore 30 years and there are no plans to extend the project crediting\nperiod beyond 30 years.\n1.7 Project Scale and Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals\nAs per the requirement in the methodology used, ex ante projections are provided below for the first\nten year period. At the end of ten years, the baseline will need to be re-evaluated and the PD will be\nupdated to include ex ante projections for the remaining ten years.\nSome leakage due to the project is expected. To be conservative, leakage has been estimated on a\nbiennial basis based on the implementation of leakage prevention activities. ex ante (See Section 3.3\nLeakage). The numbers in Table 3 represent emission minus ex ante estimated leakage.\nv3.2 12\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nAverage annual ERs 498,667\n1.8 Description of the Project Activity\nThe project aims to achieve GHG reductions by avoiding unplanned deforestation in the project area\nthat is caused by the conversion of forest into the traditional crop-fallow cycle; a practice carried out by\nrural populations dependent on subsistence agriculture throughout Sierra Leone. The first goal of the\nproject therefore revolves around strengthening the conservation strategy and effective management\nof the project area (GRNP) and a subset of project objectives and activities have been developed to\nachieve this goal (see Table 4 below). The second goal of the project revolves around working with\nlocal communities to encourage sustainable development and land use planning through a subset of\nobjectives and activities that will develop farmers capacities and environmental awareness and enable\nthem to become environmental stewards of the natural resources that underpin their livelihood\nactivities. The third goal of the project revolves around ensuring that all components of the project are\nproperly monitored in order to provide feedback for adapting the project activities where necessary to\nbetter achieve the projects vision and goals. By the end of the project, the aim is for the project\nactivities to have reduced the deforestation threat to such an extent that the forest will continue to be\nprotected. A trust fund will be created to accumulate carbon revenues that in excess of what is\nrequired to manage the project activities. These funds will then be used after the carbon financing\nends to continue any protection activities that are required.\nNone of the project activities are located within a jurisdiction covered by a jurisdictional REDD+\nprogram.\nv3.2 13"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2021: 614158.0, 2020: 600900.0, 2019: 553834.0, 2018: 541085.0, 2017: 527739.0, 2016: 513429.0, 2015: 440873.0, 2014: 426799.0, 2013: 390104.0, 2012: 377751.0}"}]}

As the forest coverage rate is 78.58%, the primary business within the\nproject area is forest industry .The existing commercial forest was mainly comprised of Chinese\nFir, Masson Pine and Broad-leaf tree, all the tree species are native to the project area. The\nproject has approximately 7,186 ha commercial forest, whose ages ranging from sapling, middle\nage to mature forest, most of the broad-leaf trees are nearly mature or mature. According to the\ntimber logging and managing plan approved by local forest authority, prior to the project\nimplementation, all timber logging including commercial harvest & tending and managing was\nplanned annually. The harvested trees will be transported to the local lumber market. From 2011\nof the project implementation, the commercial harvest has been cancelled and only tending and\nmanaging is allowed.\nAnd the forest legal right belongs to Yonglin, Yonghui, Senfa and the Forestry Bureau\nrespectively. In order to improve the efficiency, they selected Forestry Bureau to represent them\nas Project Proponent to implement the GHG related work.\nThe project activity will significantly improve the forest management conditions within the project\narea, and benefit local ecological environment. The implementation of the project will not only\nachieve a reliable measurable carbon sequestration by reducing commercial timer, but also\ncontribute to sustainable development of the local community, host country by means of:\n\uf0d8 As one of the most precious ecological resources, forest is key to biodiversity and all life\nforms. The protection of local forest will enrich the biodiversity and provide more opportunity\nfor adaptive response to natural challenges and economic development (e.g. climate change\nand new medical discoveries);\n\uf0d8 Offer job opportunities. Instead of casual labour demand for forest timber (once a year or\nseveral years), the protected forest will create some employment opportunities for forest\nmanagement. The related training process will improve the skill of the local employees.\n\uf0d8 Meet the strategy development plan of host country and local area. After the implementation\nof the project, the increasing forest coverage rate will benefit the local environmental\ncondition by producing more oxygen and absorb more greenhouse gas.\nThe land parcels of the project are listed as follow:\nv3.2 6"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2016: 53594.0, 2015: 53298.0, 2014: 53002.0, 2013: 52706.0, 2012: 26724.0, 2011: 26422.0}"}]}

Its main purpose is to generate electricity\nwith a total installed capacity of 210 MW (consisting of 3 x 70 MW turbines). Annual energy output\nis expected at 1,140 GWh;\u037e harnessing a gross water head of 404.4 m by diverting water at 42.3\nm3\/sec from the Musi river to the Simpangaur river, in an adjacent watershed, through a 7.5 km\nlong waterway and an underground powerhouse.\nThe electricity production can be described as follows. Water is taken from the Musi river through\nthe intake dam and then enters into the turbine through the high-\u00adpressure pipeline to produce\nelectricity by driving the generators. The water then discharges into to the Simpangaur river through\nthe tailrace.\nThe Project will use proven technology in electricity generation and transmission. The essential\nequipment used in the Project had to be procured from another country. Prior to the project\ncommissioning the project developer organized a series of training sessions with the equipment\nsupplier. The training conducted mainly covered the following topics: management of hydropower\ngeneration, operation and maintenance of a hydropower plant, operation and maintenance of a\nturbine, generator and other equipment. The purpose of the training was to enable the local staff to\nperform regular and safe operation and maintenance.\nThe main technical parameters of the proposed project are shown in table below:\nv3.3 6"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{2025: 976980.0, 2024: 976980.0, 2023: 976980.0, 2022: 976980.0, 2021: 976980.0, 2020: 976980.0, 2019: 976980.0, 2018: 976980.0}"}]}
