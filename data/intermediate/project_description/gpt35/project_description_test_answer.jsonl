Mangrove forest in this region had decreased by about 540 ha (9787 ha to 9248 ha) from 1990 to 2012, while bare land area had increased by about 1200 ha (450 ha to 1685 ha). \\r\\nIn this project area, the impacts of construction of artificial waterways to transport materials necessary for activities in adjacent industrial forests, the spread of fire due to fire outside the project area, and the development due to misidentification of unclear boundary line with outside the project area can be seen. In mangrove forest areas in particular, there has been a large number of small-scale activities for the development of shrimp aquaculture ponds and the logging for that, and these activities are a major cause of deforestation in this area.\\r\\nThis is evident from field surveys, satellite image analysis and interviews. This trend is also gradually expanding in the areas adjacent to the project area, and if the situation continues, the deforestation of the protected forests is likely to continue. Originally, the project area is a protected forest, and cutting down for shrimp farming is prohibited, but in this area, it has been conventionally carried out for livelihood, and the law is not generally observed.\\r\\nThe project will reduce CO2 emissions by taking appropriate preventive measures for drivers and curbing the progress of deforestation. In addition, where there is an old aquaculture pond, the silvo fishery method will be used to plant trees while preventing leakage.\\r\\nThe purpose of this project is to prevent further deforestation by providing local people with alternative means to support the lives of them such as opportunities for participation and cooperation in forest conservation and afforestation projects. Therefore, as a result of communication with local residents focusing on the sustainable development of the local society for many years before the start of the project, a deep relationship of trust has been built, and participation and cooperation in the project by them have been actively carried out. These include the organization of farmers' groups, forest patrols and afforestation activities.\\r\\n The monitoring of carbon storage is carried out by the combination of satellite image analysis and field measurement (ground truth). Landsat images are used to classify land cover. Field measurements are also made to identify the actual vegetation and to obtain data to estimate the carbon factor of the forest in the project area. It is estimated to contribute to an annual reduction of approximately 57,000 tons of CO2 emissions. On the other hand, the amount of CO2 absorbed by afforestation activities is estimated to be at an average of about 180,000 tons per year from 2022.\\r\\nAfter registering with the Verra, we will use the funds from the credit sales to maintain the project and return the funds to local residents through the construction of schools and other facilities and the provision of educational and employment opportunities, thereby contributing to the creation of a sustainable local community.\", 'project_state_province': 'South Sumatera province', 'project_country': 'Indonesia', 'project_latitude': -2.56, 'project_longitude': 105.6}"}
