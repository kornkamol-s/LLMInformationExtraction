Hence,\naccording to the methodology ACM0002, Version 17.0, there will be no project emissions, i.e. PE y\n= 0.\n3.3 Leakage\nAs per the methodology ACM0002, Version 17.0, no leakage has been considered, therefore,\nLEy = 0.\n3.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\nEx-ante calculation of emission reductions is equal to ex-ante calculation of baseline emissions\nas project emissions and leakage are nil.\nBE = EG * EF y PJ, y grid, CM, y\nWhere:\nBE = Baseline emissions in year y (tCO /yr) y 2\nEG = Quantity of net electricity generation that is produced and fed into the grid as a PJ,y\nresult of the implementation of the CDM project activity in year y (MWh/yr)\nEF = Combined margin CO emission factor for grid connected power generation in grid,CM,y 2\nyear y calculated using the latest version of the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for\nan electricity system” (tCO /MWh) 2\nBaseline emission factor (Combined Margin) (EF ) = 0.9777tCO e/MWh grid, CM, y 2\nSince, the project activity is the installation of a new grid - connected renewable power plant,\nEG = EG PJ,y facility,y\nEG = Quantity of net electricity generation supplied by the project plant/unit to the grid facility,y\nin year y (MWh/yr)\nTherefore, annual electricity supplied to the grid by the project (EG ) has been calculated as: facility,y\nEG = 59.4.MW (Capacity) x 18% (PLF) x 8760 (hours) facility,y\n= 93346.560 MWh\nAs,\nEG = EG , PJ,y facility,y\nEG = 93346.560 MWh/yr PJ,y\nTherefore, annual Baseline Emissions (BE ) = EG * EF y PJ, y grid, CM, y\n= EG * EF facility,y grid, CM, y\n=

This is\nundertaken by the project proponent and will reduce the amount of GHG emissions by\npreventing large amounts of forest degradation.\n\uf0b7 Monitoring of the region to identify and prevent further illegal logging. This will reduce the\namount of deforestation caused by secondary agents of deforestation, thus reducing the\namount of GHG emissions from the project area. NIHT is working with the Kamlapar ILG in the\nfirst PAI to ensure the monitoring and reporting of any illegal logging on their land is carried out.\n\uf0b7 Providing electricity in region, either through solar, water, or geothermal means directly reduce\nthe demand for logged or harvested firewood. This may also indirectly reduce the supply of\nwood products by increasing incomes in these areas and providing alternative livelihood\noptions that do not exploit forest resources. NIHT will be supporting the implementation of this\nproject activity with clan guidance and input.\n\uf0b7 Increasing access to co-benefits such as education, technology, clean water, and healthcare in\nthe region will aid in expanding opportunities for alternative livelihoods, as well as increase\nlocal stakeholder capacity and support of the project which has the potential to indirectly\ndecrease pressure on local forests. The project proponent will assist in building partnerships\nwith relevant institutions and organizations that can support the clans in implementing these\nactivities through sustainable development pathways.\n\uf0b7 Supporting clan business ventures and economic opportunity through supporting sustainable\nbusiness options (coconut oil) and offering gainful employment in project activities that will\nprovide alternative livelihoods that do not result in damage to the forest.

GHG emissions by sources increased as result of project activity\nGHG emissions as a result of project activities will be calculated according to the\napproved methodology. The project takes into account the increase in emissions of\nGHG gases resulting from use of fossil fuel, biomass loss and the use of fertilizer.\nFossil fuel combustion, for instance, occurs during thinning and harvesting activities,\nbut the methodology excludes transportation fuel.\nwhere:\nGHG Annual GHG emissions as result of the implementation of the A/R project activity within the E,t project boundary; tonnes CO-e yr-1 in year t 2 E CO emissions from combustion of fossil fuels within the project boundary; tonnes CO-e yr-1 FuelBurn,t 2 2\nin year t\nE GHG emissions from the loss of biomass in site preparation and conversion to A/R within the BiomassLoss,t project boundary; tonnes CO-e yr-1 in year t 2\nE Non-CO2 emission as a result of biomass burning within the project boundary; tonnes CO-e Non- 2 yr-1 in year t CO2,BiomassBurn,t\nT Ranges from 1 to end of crediting period; years\nThe project participants assume that a small amount of GHG emissions will result\nfrom site preparation and plantation management activities. However, the proposed\nA/R project activity does not engage in any burning practices during site preparation.\nFurther, conversion of herbaceous vegetation can be neglected, and the loss of GHG\nsequestered in woody biomass will not occur since trees and shrubs will not be\nremoved.\nHowever, for the project participants, it is a difficult task to estimate ex ante GHG\nemissions with a high degree of accuracy. To maintain a conservative approach for\nthe ex-ante calculation, the proposed A/R project activity applies a default 10%\nproject GHG emission value based on the CO2-e stock in living biomass of trees in\nthe project scenario However, this value will probably be adjusted during the\nverification process.\n103\n\n[['', 'Year of project', '', '', 'Year', '', '', 'GHG\\nE,t', '', '', 'GHG : %139\\nE,t', ''], ['1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30', None, None, '2002\\n2003\\n2004\\n2005\\n2006\\n2007\\n2008\\n2009\\n2010\\n2011\\n2012\\n2013\\n2014\\n2015\\n2016\\n2017\\n2018\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n2023\\n2024\\n2025\\n2026\\n2027\\n2028\\n2029\\n2030\\n2031', None, None, '197\\n1,115\\n2,735\\n4,865\\n7,352\\n10,062\\n13,051\\n16,371\\n19,949\\n23,764\\n28,271\\n34,270\\n42,494\\n53,441\\n67,320\\n83,999\\n103,066\\n123,941\\n145,711\\n167,513\\n166,667\\n187,588\\n205,400\\n219,976\\n238,402\\n247,143\\n252,446\\n263,970\\n278,380\\n265,547', None, None, '10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %\\n10 %', None, None]]\nVCS Project Description Template\nTable 22: Sum of the increases in GHG emissions by sources within the project boundary as a result of\nthe implementation of an A/R project activity\n4.3.2.

Monitoring leakage).\nThe methodology AR-AM0005 considers two sources of leakage:\nLK = LK +LK\nt Displacement_grazing,t Fuelwood,t\nwhere:\nLK Increase of GHG emissions outside the project boundary; tonnes CO-e yr-1 in year t t 2\nLK Increase of GHG emissions outside the project boundary resulting from displacement of Displacement_grazing,t grazing activities; tonnes CO-e yr-1 in year t 2\nLK Increase of GHG emissions outside the project boundary resulting from displacement of fuel Fuelwood,t wood collection; tonnes CO-e yr-1 in year t 2\nT Ranges from 1 to end of crediting period; years\nHowever, the displacement of grazing activities to other grasslands (without\novergrazing) does not result in leakage. Generally it is assumed that grazing activities\ncontinue to be executed in an extensive manner within the project boundaries and\ncommercial animal farming is not present. Hence, leakage from displacement of\ngrazing activities is considered to be zero:\nFurther, there is no collection of firewood in the baseline scenario of the project area.\nTherefore, this variable is set to zero:\n139 Project emissions are estimated to be a percentage of the estimated accumulated tCO2e sequestered through the\nA/R project activity.\n104\n\n[['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'C\\nAR', '', '', '∆C\\nACTUAL', '', '', '∆C\\nBSL', '', '', 'LK', ''], ['Year of project', 'Year of project', None, 'Year', 'Year', None, '', 'Estimation of net', '', '', 'Estimation of', '', '', 'Estimation of', '', 'Estimation of\\nleakage (tCOe)\\n2', 'Estimation of', None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'anthropogenic', None, None, 'actual net GHG', None, None, 'baseline net GHG', None, None, 'leakage (tCOe)\\n2', None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'GHG removals by', None, None, 'removals by sinks', None, None, 'removals by sinks', None, None, None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 'sinks (tCOe)\\n2', None, None, '(tCOe)\\n2', None, None, '(tCOe)\\n2', None, None, None, None], ['1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30', None, None, '2002\\n2003\\n2004\\n2005\\n2006\\n2007\\n2008\\n2009\\n2010\\n2011\\n2012\\n2013\\n2014\\n2015\\n2016\\n2017\\n2018\\n2019\\n2020\\n2021\\n2022\\n2023\\n2024\\n2025\\n2026\\n2027\\n2028\\n2029\\n2030\\n2031', None, None, '1,772\\n10,034\\n24,616\\n43,783\\n66,166\\n90,558\\n117,461\\n147,336\\n179,544\\n213,876\\n254,440\\n308,427\\n382,448\\n480,973\\n605,881\\n755,988\\n927,598\\n1,115,469\\n1,311,403\\n1,507,617\\n1,500,001\\n1,688,295\\n1,848,600\\n1,979,780\\n2,145,617\\n2,224,284\\n2,272,014\\n2,375,733\\n2,505,423\\n2,389,921', None, None, '1,772\\n10,034\\n24,616\\n43,783\\n66,166\\n90,558\\n117,461\\n147,336\\n179,544\\n213,876\\n254,440\\n308,427\\n382,448\\n480,973\\n605,881\\n755,988\\n927,598\\n1,115,469\\n1,311,403\\n1,507,617\\n1,500,001\\n1,688,295\\n1,848,600\\n1,979,780\\n2,145,617\\n2,224,284\\n2,272,014\\n2,375,733\\n2,505,423\\n2,389,921', None, None, '0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0', None, None, '0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n0', None, None]]\nVCS Project Description Template\nLK =0\nFuelwood\nBased on both contemplations, the A/R project activity considers leakage to be zero:\nLK =0\n4.4.

As identified by the timber study, the activity-shifting leakage is geographically\nconstrained by proximity to transportation routes and accessibility.\n5.5.1 ESTIMATING EMISSIONS FROM LEAKAGE\nEmissions from leakage are quantified two approaches for the purposes of ex-ante estimates. First, leakage is\nquantified by defining a leakage area and adjusting baseline rates of deforestation and degradation in the leakage\narea using leakage cancellation rates. And second, by making reasonable assumptions about the proportion of\nmerchantable biomass in the project region based on the results of the timber study to apply a conservative\nmarket-effects leakage discount. The first approach is summarized in Section 5.5.2 while the second in Section\n5.5.5.

The steps to be followed in the quantification of\nemissions according to the methodology are:\nStep 1: Estimate the amount of biomass removed. Said estimate is made in systems with existing non-woody\nor shrub-like vegetation and for the pasture lands the maximum stock present is considered, in order to be\nconservative. For coffee plantations it is carried out by counting the coffee trees eliminated per tree unit of\nthe tree stand model incorporated. The number of coffee trees removed is variable, given that their planting\ndensity in the region ranges from 6,000 to 10,000 trees/ha. The biomass estimate per individual unit is carried\nout through equations generated for the region are based on existing equations from the scientific literature\nwith data from the area51.\nStep 2: Estimate the average biomass proportion harvested (with the information and procedures of step 1)\nand apply the respective GHG emission factor.

According to Candel et al. (2006)43, the carrying capacity in semi-arid tropic regions of India is\nestimated as 1.024 LUs per ha which is slightly higher than the status of LUs per ha in the\nproject. Moreover, this carrying capacity is very conservative for the project area being moist\ntropical condition with significantly higher dry matter production than semi-arid lands.\nTherefore leakage emission attributable to the displacement of grazing activities is considered\ninsignificant in this project.\n3.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\nThe ex-ante net anthropogenic GHG emission reductions and removals are calculated using\nequation 5 of the methodology. The results for this project are shown below.\nTable 18 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\n43 See table 6 of Candel, B.S. and Malhotra,R. (2006).

The thermal energy from the biomass\nsystem displaces thermal energy previously generated for the customers (Lubrizol and Zeon) by\nOxyVinyls, L.P., and subsequently by Recast Energy Louisville, LLC, after the purchase of the\nthermal energy plant from OxyVinyls by way of Lubrizol.\nThe Project Activity consists of converting an existing coal fired boiler built in 1981 to a biomass\nfired boiler that will continue to provide thermal energy to the project customers. The biomass\nboiler will be the predominant thermal energy source for the customers. Supplemental thermal\nenergy will be provided by natural gas boilers during periods when the biomass boiler cannot\nmeet full demand load.\nThe biomass is generated generally within a wood basket that has an abundant supply of\nbiomass feedstock potential. The wood basket encompasses a one hour drive time from the\nproject site (the “Target Feedstock Area”). On a case by case basis, some biomass may be\nsourced up to two hour drive time. Within the Target Feedstock Area, an estimated 2.743,000\nmillion short tons of green (wet) biomass is generated annually. The project is expected to\nconsume between 75,000 and 100,000 green tons per year based on historical thermal energy\ndemand.\nAside from displacing greenhouse gases from fossil fuels, the project activity also has an\neconomic benefit for the local community. A large portion of the biomass fuel used in the project\nactivity was previously unused and unsellable material, which generally remained in the field and\nforest to decay or was landfilled. As a result of the project activity, the economy of the entire area\nhas benefitted through job creation in the collecting, processing and transport of materials. The\nproject activity creates roughly 30 permanent green collar jobs: 14 in plant and approximately 12\nto 20 upstream in the fuel supply chain.\nAlthough the project activity has the capacity to supply the project customer’s typical annual\nsteam load, the project proponent elects to maintain a natural gas boiler system as redundant\nbackup. When the biomass system is not able to meet the real-time full load, additional load is\nv3.2 5\n\n\n[['COEF\\nDiesel,y', '=', '1.015E-02', 'tCO2e/gal'], ['LE\\nprocess,y', '=', '38.99', 'tCO2e'], ['', '', '', ''], ['Σ(DAF\\nbiomass\\n)\\ndeliveries', '=', '25,000', 'km'], ['COEF\\nDiesel, y', '=', '1.015E-02', 'tCO2e/gal'], ['EFF\\ntt, y', '=', '9.66', 'km/gal'], ['LE\\nbiomass transp,y', '=', '26.73', 'tCO2e'], ['', '', '', ''], ['Σ(DAF )\\nash delivery', '=', '0', 'km'], ['COEF\\nDiesel, y', '=', '1.015E-02', 'tCO2e/gal'], ['EFF\\ntt,y', '=', '9.66', 'km/gal'], ['LE\\nash transp,y', '=', '0', 'tCO2e'], ['', '', '', ''], ['LEL\\nL2,y', '=', '0', 'tCO2e'], ['', '', '', ''], ['LE\\ny', '=', 'LE +\\nbiomass transp,y\\nLE + LE\\nbiomass process,y L2,y\\n+ LE + LE =\\nash transp,y L2,y', '65.72 tCO2e']]\n[['Years', '', 'Estimated', '', '', 'Estimated', '', 'Estimated\\nleakage\\nemissions\\n(tCO2e)', '', 'Estimated net', ''], [None, None, 'baseline', None, None, 'project', None, None, None, 'GHG emission', None], [None, None, 'emissions or', None, None, 'emissions or', None, None, None, 'reductions or', None], [None, None, 'removals', None, None, 'removals', None, None, None, 'removals', None], [None, None, '(tCO2e)', None, None, '(tCO2e)', None, None, None, '(tCO2e)', None], ['2013', '41,250', None, None, '993', None, None, '50', '40,207', None, None], ['2014', '55,000', None, None, '1324', None, None, '66', '53,610', None, None], ['2015', '55,000', None, None, '1324', None, None, '66', '53,610', None, None], ['2016', '55,000', None, None, '1324', None, None, '66', '53,610', None, None], ['2017', '55,000', None, None, '1324', None, None, '66', '53,610', None, None]]\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n3.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals\nThe estimated emissions reductions (ERy) are calculated as the difference between the baseline\nemissions and the project emissions and project leakage.

Our project does not have a REDD component, so REDD uncertainty calculations were\nnot necessary. We modified the X-UNC equation (21) to the following equation (40):\n(40) 2 2 �(𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑙𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝑈𝑈WRCBSL,𝑡𝑡∗×𝐺𝐺𝐶𝐶𝐺𝐺𝐵𝐵𝑊𝑊𝐵𝐵−𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝐴𝐴,𝑡𝑡∗) +(𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑙𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝑈𝑈𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝐴𝐴_𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊,𝑡𝑡∗×𝐺𝐺𝐶𝐶𝐺𝐺𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊−𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝐴𝐴,𝑡𝑡∗)\n𝑁𝑁W𝐸𝐸e𝑅𝑅 c𝑊𝑊 a𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃 lc𝑃𝑃 u+ la𝑇𝑇𝑊𝑊 te𝑊𝑊𝐶𝐶 d𝑊𝑊 C=O 2 and CH4 emission u�𝐺𝐺n𝐶𝐶c𝐺𝐺e𝐵𝐵r𝑊𝑊t𝐵𝐵a−in𝑊𝑊t𝑊𝑊ie𝐴𝐴,s𝑡𝑡∗ +f𝐺𝐺ro𝐶𝐶m𝐺𝐺𝑊𝑊 𝑊𝑊m𝑊𝑊−ic𝑊𝑊ro𝑊𝑊𝐴𝐴b,𝑡𝑡i∗a�l decomposition of peat and dissolved\norganic carbon (DOC) from water bodies in the baseline and project scenarios, using the standard error\ndata from the peat emission factors in the IPCC Wetlands Supplement 2013 (see Annex 11).53 We\nestablished that CH4 emission uncertainty was zero, as it was conservatively excluded from our emission\ncalculations. We also established that uncertainty from GHG emissions from peat burning was also zero in\nthe project scenario, as we assumed full fire prevention in the project area. However, we calculated\nuncertainty from GHG emissions from peat burning in the baseline using the dry mass burnt per stratum\nper year and their standard deviations converted to 95% confidence intervals. We combined emissions\ndata from CO2 and CH4 burning to produce an overall uncertainty in CO2 equivalent, because Module X-\nUNC does not distinguish between these emissions.\nWe calculated the uncertainty for WRC as 34.79% and 22.29% for the years 2016 and 2017, respectively\nin the baseline scenario. In the project scenario the uncertainty was calculated as 1.99% and 1.41%, for\n2016 and 2017, respectively. This resulted in a total error in this project activity at 26.12% and 17.03, for\n2016 and 2017, respectively.

The project involves construction of a reservoir with an area5 of 18 ha and a power\ndensity of 88.9 W/m2, accordingly. As the power density of this project is above 10 W/m2, GHG\nemissions from the reservoir need not to be accounted in the project activity. Thus, this project\nactivity generates GHG emission reductions up to a total expected CO emission reduction of 2\n80,244 tCO over the first crediting period of 2 years and three months 2\nThe project involves the construction of a two-generating unit hydropower plant which has new\nhydro turbines and generators in order to convert potential energy available in the river flow into\nclean electrical energy (without GHG emission) which is supplying to the national grid at the\nconnection point through the transmission line. The power metering systems are installed at the\nconnection point. They are digital and bi-direction type to measure the export and import\nelectricity of Nam Chim 1 hydropower plant.\nThe main equipment utilized in this project was imported from India. The project owner chose\nsuppliers via tender. The tender documents had set criteria for supplier to ensure that the turbines\nand alternators are environmentally safe and sound technology.\nThe project activity will achieve GHG emission reduction by displacing power generated by fossil\nfuel fired plants connected to the national grid. For CDM project activity, the crediting period will\nbe applied for a seven-year crediting period, renewable twice up to a total of 21 years\n1.9 Project Location\nThe Nam Chim Hydro Power Project is located on Nam Chim stream in Xim Vang commune, Bac\nYen district, Son La province, Vietnam.\nThe geographic coordination of the dam and powerhouse of these projects as below:\nThe site of the project is showed in Figure 1.\n5 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Report of Nam Chim 1 hydropower plant\nv3.1 5\n\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n2.3 Project Boundary\nCompletion of this section is not mandatory as per VCS Standard, Version 3.3 since the proposed\nproject activity is validated under the CDM programme.

All the subcompartments had the legal right to harvest\nissued by local forest bureau before the implementation of the project activity. Before 2016, they were\nall forests which the trees could be logged and sold once reached the cutting rotation age based on\na timber harvest plan. After 01-July-2016, they are all converted to protected forests.\n⚫ Huanjiang Maonan Autonomous County Huashan Forestry Investment Co., Ltd and Guangzhou\nGuangtan Carbon Emission Development & Investment Co., Ltd together have overall control\nresponsibility for the project. The latter is also in charge of applying VCS project.\n⚫ The purpose of strata is to improve accuracy and reduce the sampling cost. The strata is usually based\non the tree species, age and canopy density, but it does not mean all these factors should be\nconsidered for all projects, more strata means more workload and cost. For this project, the factor of\nspecies for strata could reduce the variation within the same stratum and reach the accuracy level of\n90% under certain degree of freedom. So the strata are reasonable and feasible.\n⚫ All the subcompartments are divided into 3 strata based on the tree species.\n⚫ The implementation of the project activity includes the conversion from logged to protected forests in\nthe parcels mentioned above. After the activity, trees could be avoided to be logged and then the\n7\nV4.0""}]","{""GHG Emission Reductions"":""{2035: 1489.0, 2034: 1489.0, 2033: 1489.0, 2032: 1489.0, 2031: 1489.0, 2030: 1489.0, 2029: 11832.0, 2028: 23600.0, 2027: 34322.0, 2026: 46321.0, 2025: 46321.0, 2024: 46321.0, 2023: 46321.0, 2022: 46321.0, 2021: 46321.0, 2020: 46321.0, 2019: 46321.0, 2018: 46321.0, 2017: 46321.0, 2016: 46321.0}""}","Yearly Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals records for this project are as follows:

Errors in each pool shall be weighted by the size of the pool so that projects\nmay reasonably target a lower precision level in pools that only form a small proportion of the total\nstock.\nFor both the baseline and the with-project case the total uncertainty is equal to the square root of the\nsum of the squares of each component uncertainty and is calculated at the time of reporting through\npropagating the error in the baseline stocks and the error in the project stocks.\nTherefore, total uncertainty for LtPF project is calculated as:\n(29)\nWhere:\nU total uncertainty for LtPF Project, dimensionless; total|LtPF\nU total uncertainty for the improved forest management activities in |PRJ\nthe project scenario, dimensionless; and\n58\nV 4.0'}]","{""GHG Emission Reductions"":""{2047: 80056.0, 2046: 78382.0, 2045: 26464.0, 2044: 26464.0, 2043: 26464.0, 2042: 26464.0, 2041: 26464.0, 2040: 26464.0, 2039: 26464.0, 2038: 26464.0, 2037: 26464.0, 2036: 26464.0, 2035: 26464.0, 2034: 26464.0, 2033: 26464.0, 2032: 26464.0, 2031: 26464.0, 2030: 26464.0, 2029: 26464.0, 2028: 26464.0, 2027: 26464.0, 2026: 26464.0, 2025: 26464.0, 2024: 26464.0, 2023: 26464.0, 2022: 26464.0, 2021: 26464.0, 2020: 147239.0, 2019: 142040.0, 2018: 136480.0}""}",The provided context does not contain specific yearly Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals records for the project.,0.00036476309276802004,0.16666666666666666,0.03225806451612903,0.05405405405405405,0.11764705882352941,0.021739130434782608,0.03669724770642201,0.16666666666666666,0.03225806451612903,0.05405405405405405,0.16666666666666666,0.03225806451612903,0.05405405405405405
