Version 16 is applicable where the project activity:\n\u2022 Comprises renewable energy technologies that supply users with thermal energy that\ndisplaces fossil fuels;\n\u2022 Total installed\/rated thermal energy generation of the project equipment is equal to or\nless than 45 MW thermal;\n\u2022 Biomass used as fuel meets requirements of CDM \u2013 Executive Board Meeting 23,\nAnnex 18: Definition of Renewable Biomass\nThe proposed project activity at MAG consists of the replacement of fossil fuel fired boilers and\nunit heaters, with a centrally located boiler house utilizing biomass boiler technology and locally\nobtained renewable biomass. This thermal energy will be used by the project operator and not\ndistributed to other users.\nThe boilers to be installed are rated at 8 MW thermal each. MAG will install a total of three\nboilers over a two-year period for a total rated thermal capacity of 24 MW.\nBiomass to be used in the project activity as fuel for the boilers has been identified and sourced\nand will meet the definition of renewable biomass as indicated in AMS-I.C Ver 16.\nBased on the above-mentioned applicability requirements, AMS-I.C. Ver 16 applies, and the use\nof this methodology for this project activity is justified.\n2.3 Identifying GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs for the baseline scenario and\nfor the project:\nMid American Growers project activity provides a switch to renewable biomass for thermal\napplication from natural gas.

Identification of alternative land use scenarios to the proposed project activity\nThe following alternatives are considered:\n1. Land use will continue to be agricultural with unsustainable practices, which will lead to the\nloss in soil nutrients and degradation\n2. Adoption of sustainable agricultural land management practices by considering incentives from\nthe carbon revenues (project activity)\nThe following are analyzed as the alternative land uses to the project activity which are in\ncompliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements in India.\n1. Land use will continue as pre-project land use- marginal cultivation, fallow, barren lands\n2. Adoption of sustainable agricultural land management practices (project activity)\nStep 2: Barrier analysis\nSub-step 2a. Identification of barriers that would prevent the implementation of at least one\nalternative land use scenarios\nThe barriers that are considered plausible for the implementation are:\nInvestment barriers, Institutional barriers, Technological barriers, Barriers related to local\ntradition; Barriers due to prevailing practice; Barriers due to local ecological conditions\nSub-step 2b: Elimination of land use scenarios that are prevented by the identified barriers\n31\n\nJoint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.1\nThe scenario 2 which is the implementation of SALM has technological, prevailing practice and\nlocal traditions which create a barrier for its voluntary adoption by the farmers. Further, access to\nfinance to implement the SALM practices also exist.\nOutcome of Sub-step 2b: The land use types that are not prevented by any barriers are as follows.\nAlternative 1: Land use will continue as pre-project land use which is unsustainable ALM\ntechniques which will lead to degradation of fertile crop land.\nSub-step 2c.

The four coastal zones where the\nproject will be mainly carried out have multiple Community Fisheries (Cfi), and within these Cfi\nboundaries include existing mangrove areas. Also, in the case of Inland areas where mangroves\ngrow have multiple Community Forestry (CF) to manage the mangrove forest. However, many Cfis\nand CFs with mangroves are expriencing a decrease in mangrove forests and most Cfis still have\ncoastal areas where further expansion of mangrove forests is possible. Also, CFs with mangroves\nhave degraded mangrove areas that need reforestation or management.\nAs the first instance of grouped project, it covers 100 ha of afforestation areas that are\nexpandable within the Cfi area of Kampot and Kep province. Both are coastal provinces located\n12\n\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.4\nin southern Cambodia with thirteen Community Fisheries; Kampot:8, Kep:5. Community\nFisheries in Kampot are Trapeang Ropov, Preak Tnaot, Changhaon, Kep Thmei, Toteung Tngai,\nTrapeang Sangkae, Kampong Samaki, Kaoh Kruesna Lork. Community Fisheries in Kep are Ou\nkrasar, Kampong tralach, Phum thmei, Kep, Angkaol.\nThe area of the afforestation for each Cfi is calculated through GIS analysis. The selection and\ncalculation of the area that meets the afforestation requirements were carried out by conducting\ninterviews with residents and getting information from Fisheries Cantonment (FiC), a local\nstakeholder. The requirements for the afforestation selection are as follows. 1) The lands or\ncoastal area where the tide flows in 2) The lands with mangroves that exist around area 3) The\nlands without investment or development plans 4) The lands where soil conditions are muddy\nnot sandy or rocky 5) The lands where the area is exposed during the low tide season to plant\nmangroves 6) The lands where natural disasters are less frequent 7) Other lands that can be\njudged as areas in need of afforestation in the experience of local residents.\nIn addition, the project area is divided into existing mangrove areas, seagrass areas, fishing\nzone areas, and private land to prevent conversion of existing land use due to afforestation. The\nmap of the Cfis and project boundaries in Kampot and Kep provinces where this project being\nimplemented can be seen in the figure 2. and figure 3. below. An afforestation plan optimized\nfor mangrove afforestation in the project boundary is prepared through soil analysis and tree\nspecies investigation for afforestation areas selected within the project boundary map below.\nThe coordinates and area of the afforestation will finally be updated according to the new\nafforestation plan within this Project Description. In addition, stratification is carried out based\non this afforestation plan to enable accurate GHG emission reduction calculations.\nFor another instances, other bare lands for afforestation and degraded mangrove areas for\nreforestation will be identified by conducting GIS analysis and on-site visit. After then, the project\ntargeted area is determined through the same process as the first instance. Therefore, the area\nto be scaled up in this grouped project will be updated to Project Description periodically.\n13\n\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.4\nFigure 2. 1ST Instance Project Location (Kampot)\nFigure 3. 1st Instance Project Location (Kep)\n.\n14\n\nVCS Project Description Template, v4.4"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_country': 'Cambodia'}"}]}

Below is a broad-level overview showing the geographic spread of\nour project sites across Botswana. Project areas are filled in with a green shade, and the\nCentral Kalahari Game Reserve (National Park, shaded white) is included just for\nreference to demonstrate the proximity of PAIs to WMAs and protected areas. Below the\nbroad-level overview are additional GIS based maps with the project areas in the Kuke\nCorner and Ghanzi-Areas accompanied by an individual breakdown of each property with\ncorner GPS coordinates and supplemental information.\n15\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\nNote: Modisa Conservation Project is farther south and was omitted in this diagram\ndue to sizing restrictions. Boundaries for this project site are included in section 3.3,\nand ecological\/ancillary conditions are described and illustrated later in this section.\nStratification of PAIs by ecological conditions\nAll PAIs are further stratified into ecozones delineated based on MAP (mean annual\nprecipitation) among other factors.\n16\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\nMAP zone delineation process\nSatellite rainfall data were utilised to spatially operationalize rainfall zones in a region\nwhere in situ precipitation measurement infrastructure is inconsistent. Integrated Multi-\nsatellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) products (version 6)\nwere used because of global coverage and temporal richness.\nFor this work\u2014focusing on 20 years of fire occurrence\u2014 IMERG GPM data were\naggregated for each month, but it is important to note that this methodology and dataset\ncould be aggregated differently (e.g., daily) if a finer or coarser temporal aggregation would\nbe applicable. Monthly values were then used to produce three bands of annual data:\nmean, median, and standard deviation to capture separate metrics of central tendency\n(mean and median) and a metric for interannual variation (std. dev). The bands for each\nyear ranging from 2000-2021 were stacked in GEE to produce a single 66-band image\ncompatible with GEE's clusterer (unsupervised classification) package. The Weka K-\nmeans algorithm was used to classify statistically similar rainfall zones across the region.\nThe algorithm includes controls for the initialization method (random, k-means++, canopy,\nfarthest first), a distance function, and a seed function. The k-means++ initialization\nmethod was used with the Euclidean distance function and the default seed value of 10.\n17\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\nThe Weka K-means clustering algorithm allows for an assigned number of classes to be\nestablished. There is no single correct number of classes for which similar precipitation\nregimes should be clustered. Instead, it is a factor of the region size and observations\nbeing conducted that determine the number of classes. In this case, a range of classes\nwas tested from 6-15 to determine the number of classes to classify. Visual analysis paired\nwith existing understandings of major ecoregions in the region (cite) was used to settle on\n7 classes."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_country': 'Botswana'}"}]}

The SPA project is established by planting of trees. The\nproject includes timber harvesting in their management plan which is in keeping with VCS ARR\nguidelines.\nii) The project has not led to any conversion of native ecosystems. All the lands parcels were barren\nfor much in excess of ten years before project start date as evident in lease agreement documents\n(explained in details in Section 1.10).\niii) The length of the project crediting period has been set at thirty three years.

The project activity falls under the small scale projects. The methodology chosen for\nthe project activity and its applicability to the project activity is discussed below.\nType I: Renewable Energy Projects\nCategory D: Grid Connected Renewable Electricity Generation\nTechnology\/measure\n1. This category comprises renewable energy generation units, such as photovoltaics, hydro,\ntidal\/wave, wind, geothermal and renewable biomass, that supply electricity to and\/or\ndisplace electricity from an electricity distribution system that is or would have been supplied\nby at least one fossil fuel fired generating unit.\n2. If the unit added has both renewable and non-renewable components (e.g. a wind\/diesel\nunit), the eligibility limit of 15MW for a small- scale CDM project activity applies only to the\nrenewable component. If the unit added co-fires fossil fuel2, the capacity of the entire unit\nshall not exceed the limit of 15MW.\n3. Combined heat and power (co- generation) systems are not eligible under this category.\n4. In the case of project activities that involve the addition of renewable energy generation\nunits at an existing renewable power generation facility, the added capacity of the units added\nby the project should be lower than 15 MW and should be physically distinct3from the\nexisting units.\n5. Project activities that seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for renewable energy\ngeneration are included in this category. To qualify as a small scale project, the total output of\nthe modified or retrofitted unit shall not exceed the limit of 15 MW.\nThis project activity comes under point number 1 of the technology \/measures of AMS I-D.\nThe applicability of this methodology may be explained through the following arguments\n\u00b7 The project activity involves electricity generation using renewable energy which is\nbased on wind power and wheeling of the electricity generated to the Sree JayaJyothi\nTextile Mills Pvt Ltd through Tamil Nadu State Electricity Board (TNEB). This\nproject activity displaces the equivalent amount of electricity generation through the\noperation of existing\/proposed fossil fuel based power plants connected to the Grid.\n\u00b7 The project activity involves installation of renewable energy generation units only\n(Wind Turbine Generators)\n\u00b7 The project activity doesn\u2019t involve cogeneration system. The project activity\ninvolves electricity generation from the Wind Turbine Generators.\n\u00b7 The project activity doesn\u2019t involve addition of renewable energy generation units at\nexisting power generation facility.\n2 Co-fired system uses both fossil and renewable fuels.\n3 Physically distinct units are those that are capable of generating electricity without the operation of\nexisting\nunits, and that do not directly affect the mechanical, thermal, or electrical characteristics of the existing\nfacility. For example, the addition of a steam turbine to an existing combustion turbine to create a\ncombined\ncycle unit would not be considered \u201cphysically distinct\u201d.\n11\n\nVCS Project Description Template\n\u00b7 The project activity doesn\u2019t seek to retrofit or modify an existing facility for\nrenewable energy generation.\n\u00b7 The total installed capacity of the project activity is 8.0 MW which is less than the\neligibility limit of 15 MW to qualify as a small scale project activity under Type I of\nthe small scale methodologies Also no additional WTGs will be added to the project\nactivity during its lifetime; Hence the project activity will remain under small scale\nproject activity during every year of crediting period.\nHence it can be concluded that the selected methodology, AMS I D \u2013 Grid Connected\nRenewable Electricity Generation is applicable to project activity"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Renewable Energy'}"}]}

In a first\nstep, primarily project instances at bank sites are included in the grouped project.\nAll equipment is new and installed, owned, operated and maintained by Starsight Energy.\nIn the absence of the project activities, the building users would have\ni) procured electricity from a national or a regional grid (grid hereafter) and\/or a fossil fuel\nfired captive power plant, and\nii) used inefficient air conditioners that are replaced in the case of retrofit measures or would\notherwise be built in the case of a new facility, and thus used more fossil-fuel based grid\nand\/or captive power than in the project scenario.2\nThanks to the replacement of fossil-fuel based grid and captive power by renewable solar PV energy\nand the saving of fossil-fuel based electricity through more efficient air conditioners, and less CO 2\nreleased to the atmosphere. Therefore, the project activities will achieve net GHG emissions reductions.\nBecause of the renewable energy and energy efficiency activities and as per current roll-out plans in\nNigeria, annual CO2 emissions will be reduced by 50,938 tCO2 accumulating to 356,569 tCO2 at the\nend of first 7-year crediting period in 2026.3\nServing the commercial and industrial, financial, residential, educational and agricultural sectors,\nStarsight Energy delivers tailored power and cooling solutions to meet client requirements while\n1 After Starsight\u2019s intervention.\n2 Nigeria has been suffering extensive power outages during the last 15 years (cf.\nhttps:\/\/tradingeconomics.com\/nigeria\/number-of-electrical-outages-in-a-typical-month-wb-data.html).

New instances will be incorporated only if they satisfy in addition\nto the requirements under methodology VM0010 the following criteria\nWhere inclusion of a new project activity instance necessitates the addition of a new project\nproponent to the project, such instances shall be included in the grouped project within five years\nof the project activity instance start date.\nv3.0 11\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nThe risks to GHG reductions or removals are illegal logging and fire both of which would reduce\nthe amount of carbon stocks present in the property.\nFirewood collection is not deemed a risk because the population density is very low and the main\nuse of firewood is for cooking. Unsustainable fuel wood collection is not occurring within the\nproject boundaries. Thus unsustainable fuel wood collection is not a source of leakage or\nemissions for this project.\nThe quantization of GHG reductions removals will be carried out following section 3 of this project\ndescription and merits no additional information in this section.\nThe grouped project has a central GHG information system and controls associated with the\nproject and its monitoring. The central GHG infomation system and controls will require that All\ndata will be digitalized, stored at different locations and stored for at least 2 years beyond the\ncrediting period as required under section 3.18.1 of the VCS Standard v3.2. For all instances the\nfollowing tasks will be undertaken\na. The baseline scenario will be reviewed every ten years.\nb. Monitor carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions.\nc. Estimation of ex-post net carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions\nd. Monitor leakage and greenhouse gas emissions\nIn addition, all instances will be subjected to the same procedures of section 4 with regards to\n1.

Frequency\nThere are no equivalent type and level of activity of products or services provided by the project\nand the baseline scenario. On the contrary, in the baseline scenario, the project area produces\nwood products and in the project, the forest remains standing. This significant difference\nbetween the project and the baseline scenario is to be expected in this methodology, as selective\nlogging activities are incompatible with forest remaining forests.\nLeakage Management\nUnder the methodology there are only two sources of leakage: Activity shifting and Market\neffects. The first is calculated using step 5.1 of the methodology. The second is calculated using\nv3.0 12\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\nstep 5.2 of the methodology. Activity shifting is monitored through identification of all parcels\nowned by the logging agent and verification through historical records and forest management\nplans.

According to the\nmethodology\u2019s section 2.2 Applicability, the methodology is applicable if the following\nconditions are met:\na) The land subject to the project activity does not fall in wetland category;\nThere are no wetlands within the project boundary [2].\nb) Soil disturbance attributable to the project activity does not cover more than 10 per cent of\narea in each of the following types of land, when these lands are included within the project\nboundary:\n(i) Land containing organic soils;\nAmongst the encountered soil series (Ultisols and Alfisols), no organic soils are present within\nthe project boundary [2].\n(ii) Land which, in the baseline, is subjected to land-use and management practices and\nreceives inputs listed in appendices 1 and 2 to this methodology.\nThe project area is characterized as degraded pasture land and, in areas closer to population\ncenters, this is combined with subsistence farming [2].\n47\n\nJoint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.0\nThe lands of Appendix 1 refer to cropland in which soil disturbance is restricted. Farming in the\narea is characterized as small-scale subsistence farming [2], which is characterized as\ncultivation with reduced tillage and limited use of inputs. Therefore, the project area does not\nclassify as land listed in Appendix 1.\nThe lands of Appendix 2 refer to grassland in which soil disturbance is restricted. Grasslands in\nthe project area are used for extensive livestock ranching activities and without the use of\ninputs [17]. Therefore, the project area does not classify as land listed in Appendix 2.\nFurthermore, the tool Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate\nadditionality in A\/R CDM project activities is applicable, as the forestation of the land [\u2026] does\nnot lead to violation of any applicable law [\u2026] and the project does not concern a small - scale\nafforestation (<15 kton of CO2Eq annually), as shown in section 1.10.\nAs for the tool Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in\nA\/R CDM project activities, no applicability conditions exist, and the tool can therefore be\napplied.\nFor the Estimation of the increase in GHG emissions attributable to displacement of pre-project\nagricultural activities in A\/R CDM project activity, the tool is not applicable if displacement of\nagricultural activities is expected to cause, directly or indirectly, any drainage of wetlands or\npeat lands. As demonstrated above, the project does not take place in wetlands or peatlands,\nand therefore the tool is applicable.\nAs for the Tool for estimation of change in soil organic carbon stocks due to the implementation\nof A\/R CDM project activities, the requirements for applicability are that areas do not fall into\nthe wetlands category (compliance covered above), litter remains on site and is not removed in\nthe A\/R CDM project activity (true, litter is not removed on site through management practices);\nand soil disturbance [\u2026] is in accordance with appropriate soil conservation practices and\nlimited to soil disturbances for site preparation before planting and such disturbance is not\nrepeated in less than twenty years. The latter conditions are also true, as soil disturbance only\ntakes place once in twenty years with the site preparation before planting with the tree species\n[17].\nConcerning the Tool for the identification of degraded or degrading lands for consideration in\nimplementing CDM A\/R project activities, the applicability is limited to projects in the A\/R\ncategory, which is the case for the current project, as the project concerns a reforestation\nproject.\n48\n\nJoint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.0"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_methodologies': ['AR-ACM0003']}"}]}

Generations of human occupation\nand farming have made the Project Area biodiversity-poor. With TIST it has improved. We have\nplanted and maintained 411,068 indigenous trees, covering 1,653 ha and contained in 14,601\nProject Areas. These are islands of biodiversity in a degraded landscape matrix that provide\nconnectivity among the natural forests and other islands of biodiversity. There are over 19,073\ntotal Project Areas operated by farmers that are receiving ongoing training in biodiversity and\nnatural resource management. Those of these that do not have indigenous trees still provide\nforest cover. In addition, there are 305,097 fruit and nut trees covering 1,208.67 ha. These\nprovide a source of food and nectar for bees, birds, small animals living on, or around, the farms\nand larger animals when present.\nAn Environmental Impact Audit was carried out by Natural Resources Management &\nDevelopment Agency (NAREDA Consultants) in Meru and Nanyuki areas of Kenya,60 to assess\nthe environmental conditions and biodiversity of the area and to assess positive and negative\nenvironmental impacts of TIST project activities. The EIA and other assessments indicate that\nthe Project Areas themselves were not areas rich in biodiversity. However, some areas border\nMt Kenya and conserved forest, areas rich in biodiversity. By providing fuel wood from\nsustainable wood lots and improving livelihoods, the project should have a positive effect on\nbiodiversity.\nPromotion of Conservation Farming will further reduce pressure on forestland by increasing food\nproductivity by, and consequently decreasing pressure for, land clearing for agriculture.\nBiodiversity is also enhanced directly through the planting of indigenous trees, both in specific\nriparian \u2018biodiversity\u2019 groves, and through dispersed inter-planting, homestead planting and\nwoodlots. Increases in tree biodiversity should also enhance diversity of associated species,\nincluding pollinators, and other beneficial species, while protection of riparian areas will improve\nwater quality and provide other important ecosystem services.\nComparing the without-project scenario and with-project conditions, it has been demonstrated\nthat the project has a net positive impact on biodiversity."},{"role":"assistant","content":"{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}"}]}

Specifically, the project category is \u201cAvoided Unplanned Deforestation &\nDegradation\u201d (AUDD) for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD).\nG1.3 Guatemala is among the 19th megadiverse countries in the world, with 33.7% of forest\ncover land. Its native forest contribute significantly to the livelihood of local populations. About a\nthird of the national territory has been declared a protected area. The multicultural richness of the\ncountry, together with traditional and ancestral knowledge of the inhabitants, constitutes a\npotential for climate change projects.\nThe project zone is included in the Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) Selva Maya Corridor, which\ncontains the second most extensive tract of continuous tropical rainforest in the Americas after\nthe Amazon Forest, where Selva Lacand\u00f3na and Sierra del Lacand\u00f3n (Mexico\/Guatemala) are\none of the four keys biodiversity areas1. The Sierra del Lacand\u00f3n National Park (SLNP) is one of\nthe seven nucleuses of the Mayan Biosphere Reserve (MBR) which represents almost 20% of\nthe surface of Guatemala and about 60% of the surface inside the Guatemala System of Natural\nProtected Areas (SIGAP as per Sistema Guatemalteco de \u00c1reas Protegidas). Within the borders\nof the SLNP there are at least 29 archaeological sites from the Mayan Civilization, including the\nmonumental city of Piedras Negras2.\nThe SLNP is the second largest National Park in Guatemala. It has been characterized, along\nwith the Mirador-Rio Azul National Park, as the region of greatest plant diversity within the MBR.\nThe rugged terrain and rainfall, higher than the rest of the reserve, give it unique characteristics. It\nhas outstanding archaeological remains of the classical and pre-classical Maya civilization3.\nThe Lacand\u00f3n \u2013 Forest for Life (Bosques para la Vida) REDD+ Project (hereinafter Lacand\u00f3n\nREDD+ Project) focuses on reduce deforestation that is being exerte by different agents on the\nforest region by improving living condition of the communities located within the National Park\nand surrounding areas. Through implementation of project activities, the environmental function\nof the diverse ecosystems will be maintained, the cultural tangible heritage will be preserved and\ngreenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and degradation processes will be prevented.\n1 Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund. 2010.

CONAP awarded in 1999 the co-management of the SLNP with\nthe Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) Fundaci\u00f3n Defensores de la Naturaleza (FDN).\nThe patterns of deforestation and their associated agents and drivers in the area have been\nidentified and understood. The importants factors are the increase of human population linked to\nthe expansion of agropecuarian activities and forest fires due to slash and burn forest method,\nillegal logging, lack of public institutions presence in the field, illegal settlements and extraction of\nnatural resources (hunting and non-timber forest products as the xate palm - Chamaedorea sp).\nThe project will analyse, design and implement measures that will result in lower deforestation\nrates while includes the deforestation agents in activities that enhance the integrated\nmaintenance of the natural resources and the archeological sites. The project activities will pay\nspecial attention to the specific social and cultural issues and will incorporate these\ncharacteristics in the management plans considering at the same time, the specific biodiversity\nand climate characteristics of the region.\nG1.2 The project\u2019s community objectives takes into account the strengthening of local\ngovernance; supporting the development of sustainable economic and livelihoods alternatives\nthrough training and technical workshops; enhancing local administrative capacity, leadership\ncapacity and environmental awareness through training activities. The project activities are based\non community dialog, education and training.\nThe climate objectives will be covered through the implementation of activities to reduce\ndeforestation and forest degradation by decreasing illegal timber extraction and assuring legality\nof land use right through forest sustainable management. These activities will help reduce GHG\nemissions and will increase carbon stocks over time.\nAlthough deeper understanding of the biodiversity occurring in the project region is still needed,\nthe presence of species classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of\nNature (IUCN) has been well documented. Examples are Jaguar \u2013 Panthera onca (Near\nthreatened), Tapir \u2013 Tapirus bairdii (Endangered) and Pecari - Tayassu pecari (Vulnerable) for\nfauna; and Cedro \u2013 Cedrela odorata (Vulnerable) and Caoba \u2013 Swietenia macrophylla\n(Vulnerable) for flora. The project\u2019s biodiversity objectives focusing on preserving endangered\nspecies and their habitats as compared to baseline scenario conditions through communal\nforestry resources management, forest protection and biodiversity programs.\nGiven the high natural and cultural values present in the region, it is of utmost importance to\nidentify the environmental and economic context that surrounds the processes of deforestation\ncurrently occurring in the area. The agents and drivers of deforestation have been identified\nthrough literature review and workshops conducted with representatives of institutions.\nThe project activities will focus on identifying, prioritizing and executing actions for the adequate\nmanagement of the environmental and cultural resources and achieve their most effective and\nefficient conservation, while benefiting the sustainable development of the region.\n4 Congreso de la Rep\u00fablica. 1989.

The geodetic points\nof South Africa i.e. the grouped project boundary are shown in Table 1. A more detailed\nboundary is saved in and available in an appropriate digital Geographic Information\nSystems (GIS) format (KML 2.2 and ESRI shapefiles). The project proponent has access\nto numerous potential areas for project activity instances, including at least 19\ntownships areas at present, i.e. the availability of land for project activity instances will\nnot be a limiting factor. Whilst this land is available, communities lack the financial\nresources to plant trees.\nThe initial project activity instance will be in extension of the Delft township, situated to\nthe south and east of the principle Delft township (Figure 1). This area falls within the\nCape Metropolitan Area in the City of Cape Town. The principle township had a\npopulation of 60,667 residents in 20016. Of these, 99% had no tertiary education, 44%\nwere unemployed, 99% earned less than R6,400 per month (approximately7 USD 900\nper month) and 66% earned less than R1,600 per month (approximately USD 225 per\nmonth). The area of the Delft project activity instance is 84 ha in size and comprised of\nRDP houses (Figures 2 and 3). The area of the project activity instance is delineated by a\nbounding box (maximum North, South, East and West coordinates; Table 1). A more\nspecific boundary is saved in a GIS format (KML 2.2 and ESRI shapefiles). This\ndelineated boundary is the perimeter of the identified township within which all initial\nand future sponsored tree planting for carbon offsetting for the project activity instance\nwill occur. Within the project activity instance boundaries are specific planting sites in\nhousehold gardens. The Delft project activity instance meets the site eligibility criteria\nlisted in Section 1.168.\nAdditional project activity instances will be added to the grouped project through the\ncrediting period. This is a practice endorsed by the VCS grouped project methodology.\nThese additional instances will meet the eligibility criteria listed in Section 1.16 and will\nbe validated and formally incorporated into the grouped project during each verification\nperiod. The boundaries will be set and saved as described above. In keeping with the\nguidelines specified by the selected methodology, where instances are within 1 km of\neach other they will be managed and monitored as a single instance9, ensuring the\nproject emission reductions are within the 16,000 tonnes CO e per annum limit per 2\nproject area set by the methodology.\nTable 1: Bounding coordinates of the grouped project and initial project activity\ninstance.\nDelft 18.631929, -33.986721 18.643549, -33.976056 84\n6 City of cape Town, Census 2001, Delft.

Applications\nare received from township communities, proposals are drafted by FTFA and sponsors\nmatched to potential areas for project activity instance, the trees are purchased using\nthe sponsor\u201fs money and the tree planting process is initiated as per the Procedures\nManual. While the grouped project area is South Africa, only specific townships that have\nrequested trees will be planted as part of the project activities, using sponsorship money\nfrom the list of companies waiting to invest in carbon offsetting with FTFA. Consequently,\nalthough significantly less than 80% of the area within the grouped project boundary is\ncurrently under the control of the project proponent, it is deemed that there is more\nthan sufficient area and interest to meet the goal of planting 5 million additional trees.\nA. The additionality argument is valid for all townships in South Africa, whether or not\nthey are included as project instances (now or in the future), because no other\n10 Google Inc. 2011.

There will be no increased emissions attributable to the project activity in areas that\nare not part of the project. As detailed above, townships for project activity instances\nare selected following a programmatic approach, and FTFA has a list of many\ncommunities requesting trees and many sponsor requesting to offset their carbon\nemissions. Failure to include such sites within the grouped project area will not lead to\nincreased emissions through leakage, since there is no displacement of activities.

The project is classified in scope 14 - AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses) and\nfalls into the category Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) in the scopes of\nplanned (APD) and unplanned (AUDD) deforestation.\nThe REDD Carbonflor\u00b4s main goal is to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) through the\nconservation of native vegetation in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. The project is based on the\nconservation of the remaining forest cover of properties under pressure from deforestation and degradation.\nInformation generated by the National Institute for Space Research (\"INPE\") on monitoring forest cover in\nthe Cerrado and Amazon biomes points to increasing deforestation rates since 2012. For the Cerrado\nBiome, annual deforestation rate was of 7,905.16 km212 in 2021 (August 1st, 2020, to July 31st, 2021), a\n7,9% increase from the previous datapoint, 2020. For the Amazon biome, deforestation reached 13,235\nkm2 in 2021 (August 1st, 2020, to July 31st, 2021). This represents a 21,97% increase from the previous\ndatapoint, 2020.13\nSuch matter becomes even more relevant considering that these biomes have the highest deforestation\nrates in the country. The increases in deforestation observed in 2021 in the Cerrado and Amazon\ncorroborate the progress of deforestation activity in natural forests in Brazil, which leaves us in close point\nto reach the imbalance of the natural systems14, which affects the provisions of energy, water, and food\nsecurity in Brazil and worldwide.\nGiven the high rates of deforestation in these two biomes, the project seeks landowners who have\nproperties in the Cerrado and Amazon who choose not to deforest their properties in the legally permitted\nportions (APD), as well as guarantee the protection of permanent preservation areas (APP) and legal\nreserve (RL) of their properties (AUDD), which have also been the target of illegal deforestation and\ndegradation over the last few decades.\nIn this way, REDD Carbonflor will promote the conservation of natural forests and aims to obtain positive\nnet benefits for communities and biodiversity. Thus, in addition to reducing carbon emissions, the project\nwill promote benefits in maintaining the biodiversity of fauna and flora, providing a safe habitat for local\nfauna, increasing water retention, protecting water resources, and maintenance of the region's\nmicroclimate. Regarding the communities, the benefits will be achieved through actions of social\nengagement, education, training and capacity building, and support for local infrastructure.\nIn this context, ECCON will be responsible, as the proponent of the project, for the development of all\nstages, implementation in the different instances, and monitoring of the parameters of climate, community,\nand biodiversity of REDD Carbonflor. The other entities involved in the project are the landowners, who,\nthrough the signing of a contract and letter of intent, attest to their commitment to keeping the areas of their\nproperties conserved in the long term, which will allow for them to support the activities of the projects to\nbe developed.\n12 https:\/\/www.gov.br\/inpe\/pt-br\/assuntos\/ultimas-noticias\/nota-tecnica-prodes-cerrado-2021\n13 https:\/\/www.gov.br\/inpe\/pt-br\/assuntos\/ultimas-noticias\/divulgacao-de-dados-prodes.pdf\n14 Lovejoy and Nobre, 2019 - https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/yp6tx5eu\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 5\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nIt is important to highlight that the carbon credit revenue generated by REDD Carbonflor will contribute to\nconservation, by making the activity more attractive to rural producers supported by the project, therefore\nthe maintenance of the \u201cstanding forest\u201d will be a competitive alternative to other land uses (i.e., agricultural\nor livestock production), which are a threat to conversion of native vegetation in the current scenario.\nCarbonflor REDD activities began in 2021, with a 30-year crediting period, from October 6th, 2021, to\nOctober 5th, 2051.

The project is aimed to\nrestore the local degraded grassland ecosystem from adoption of sustainable grassland management\npractices, such as improving the rotation of grazing animals between summer and winter pastures,\nlimiting the timing and number of grazing animals on degraded pastures, and restoration of severely\ndegraded land by replanting with perennial grassesand ensuring appropriatemanagement over the long-\nterm.TheprojectproponentisOtogFrontBannerCulturalTourismGroupLtd.\nAccording to the baseline survey, before the implementation of the project, the grassland in the region\nhas been facing serious degradation and even desertification due to the impact of climate change and\nhumanactivities.\nTotally, 100,297.85 ha of degraded grassland has been managed scientifically by including by fence\nbuilding and reseeding of native grass species. There are three mainrestoration measuresas followed in\ntheproject:\nRest grazing and rotational grazing are implemented in moderate degraded area where total grass yield\ndecreased by 21%-50% compared with the non-degraded grassland as per Parameters for Degradation,\nSandificationandSalificationofRangelands(GB19377-2003).\nRotational grazing requires that the grazing time shall be reduced by dividing grasslands into seasonal\ngrazing land according to the livestock carrying capacity of the grassland by fence building. Then based\non specified grazing order, grazing cycle and zoning grazing time, the grassland is grazed area by area\nand used in turn.35,365.07 ha of degraded grassland has been managed sustainably by the\nimplementationofrotationalgrazing.\nRest grazing is also implemented in moderately degraded areas and requires that grazing shall not be\ncarried out within 90days when the grass turns green (20-March to 20-June) every year by building the\nfence, which is conducive to full greening and subsequent growth of herbage. 34,630.97ha of degraded\ngrasslandhavebeenmanagedscientificallybytheimplementationofrestgrazing.\nReseeding the grassland was implemented in seriously degraded grasslands where total grass\ndecreased by more than 50% compared with the non-degraded grassland as per GB19377-2003. Total\n30,301.81ha of degraded grassland have been reseed to restore the grassland productivity. Native grass\nspecies including Artemisia frigida, cleistogenes songorica, Agropyron mongolicum, stipa breviflora,\nPennisetum centrasiaticum and Iris bungei Maxim were for seeding based on the soil and climate\nconditions in the project area. After reseeding the grass, the project area needs to be fenced for 3 years\ntoprohibit grazing in order tobetter restoregrassland vegetation.
