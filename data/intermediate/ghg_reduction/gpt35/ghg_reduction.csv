PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
The project boundary encompasses also the project electricity system(s) and Heat/steam
generation system that the PO plant is connected to. The spatial extent of the project electricity
system consists of the power plants that are physically connected through transmission and
distribution lines to the project activity and that can be dispatched without significant transmission
constraints. The project is connected to the Glow grid which in turn is connected to the national
grid. Therefore, the national grid is considered as the ultimate connected grid. The spatial extent
for the heat (steam) system is similar, including the heat/steam generating systems that are
physically connected to the project activity and that can be displaced without significant
constraints. The heat (steam) requirements of the project are met by the steam extracted from the
cogeneration plants of Glow grid. As the emissions get accounted in the electricity component
therefore to avoid double counting and applying conservative principle the emission factor for
steam has been considered as zero. The fuel requirement is for incineration purpose. Natural gas
is being used as the fuel.
For the CHPO-chlor-alkali process (baseline scenario), the spatial extent of the project boundary
is defined as follows:

A.4.4 Estimated amount of emission reductions over the chosen crediting period:
The crediting period starts with the commissioning of the plant, exactly with the first day of documented
electricity supply to the grid. There is no indication, that relevant transmission constraints divide the
national Turkish grid into regional subgrids, which had to separately be evaluated5.
The expected yearly net electricity generation is listed in the table below.
Azmak II HEPP is in operation since 24 December 2009. With this the starting date of the first crediting
period is 24 December 2009.
Operation of:
o Azmak I is planned in March 2010
o Kirpilik is expected in April 2010
The estimated emission reductions from the first and last year of the crediting period sum up to the
amount of the estimated yearly reductions.
Emission reductions will be calculated based on the calculated Combined Margin (for details see B.4).

1.7 Project Scale and Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals
The project is a large scale project that involves setting up of 140.0 MW of Solar power project.
As the estimated annual average GHG emission reductions or removal per year is 241,573 tCO e 2
which is less than 300,000 tonnes of CO e per year, thus the project falls in the category of 2
Project.
3 The ER estimation is done based on 20.50% PLF and 8760 hours of annual operation and 0.5% of
degradation factor per year from second year. This is as per DPR assumption. However for IRR sheet
electricity generation is determined based on financial year and number of days of financial year and
expected date of commissioning considered for IRR calculations.

Determination of EFBL,c
However, the baseline emission factor for continuously flooded fields without organic
amendments ( ) can be determined ex ante prior to the start of the project activity, in this
case, the ex ante value should be used to calculate emission reduction during the crediting 𝐵𝐵𝐸𝐸𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵,𝑐𝑐
period. It should be measured by using closed chamber in three reference fields which are
chosen in the project area.
According to the guidance on methane measurement in the appendix of AMS-III.AU
Methodology, the following requirements should be met.
1. The implementation of methane measurement in rice fields requires the involvement of
experts in this field or at least experienced staff trained by experts (i.e. from research
institutions). These guidelines cannot replace expertise in setting up chamber measurements.
They rather set minimum requirements that serve for standardizing the conditions under
which methane emissions are measured for projects under this methodology.
The closed chamber measurement requires the involvement of technicians trained by experts
from Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences under the jurisdiction of the Anhui Agricultural
Bureau. Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences is a comprehensive agricultural research
28 For all scaling factor used in this methodology, the average values in 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories are chosen.

season and 29 July 2017 for the second season, respectively. The base is embedded just
before transplanting, and the first gas sampling began on the second day after transplanting,
followed by sampling every 7days. After sampling, the gas is stored in the evacuated vial,
and the samples collected after three times should be taken together for laboratory analysis.
Project proponents shall prepare a detailed plan for the seasonal methane measurements
before the start of the season. The plan shall include the schedule for the field and laboratory
measurements, the logistics that are necessary to get the gas samples to the laboratory and
a cropping calendar. The plan shall also include all reference field specific information
regarding location and climate, soil, water management, plant characteristics, fertilizer
treatment and organic amendments.

Ex-ante total net reduction of GHG anthropogenic Emissions
Significance Assessment
Based on the document ""EB-CDM approved"" “Tool for testing significance of GHG emissions in
A/R CDM Project activities”, we could verify that the above-ground biomass will contribute with 85% of the
expected emissions in the baseline scenario. On the other side, below-ground biomass will contribute
with 15%.
Ex-ante estimate calculation of GHG emissions total net reduction
VM0015 Equation 19 has been used to calculate the ex-ante estimate of the project emission
reduction.
Ex-ante calculation of Verified Carbon Units (VCUs)
VM0015 Equation 20 was applied to estimate the number of VCUs. The project Risk Factor
parameter was estimated using the VCS AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool, resulting in 10%.

As also explained above, for the computation of the Simple OM, the Ex-Ante option is selected, at the
time of PDD submission to the DOE, the data vintages that were most recent, belongs to the years
2008, 2009 and 2010. All the data used in calculation of the Simple OM are taken from the TEİAŞ
website, details of which are given below. Taking into account the available data “Simple OM” method
“Option B” is the appropriate method for the project activity. TEİAŞ publishes the annual heating
values of the fuels consumed in the power plants, the heating values are directly related to fuel
consumption and are used to calculate average Net Calorific Values (TJ/kt) (Table 10).
The heating values of fuels consumed in thermal power plants are announced by TEİAŞ, the unit of
the heating values are Tcal. Tcal is converted to GJoule by using the conversion factor 1cal = 4.1868
Joule. Then the heating values in GJ are divided by Fuel Consumption (FC ) to get the Net Calorific i,y
Values of the fuels consumed in TJ/kt as follows:

available data from the TEİAŞ website.
Table 11: Calculation of emission by electricity generation (2008-2010)
Net electricity generated and supplied to the grid by thermal power plants has been calculated using
data obtained from TEİAŞ web page. The ratio between total gross and total net generation (including
low-cost/must run plants) has been calculated for each year. The same ratio is assumed to be valid
for all thermal plants and total net generation by the plants has been calculated accordingly. Summing
up total net generation with the imported electricity, total supply excluding low cost / must run sources
for each year is determined and given in Table 12.
28 It is shown as zero as in year 2008 and 2010 there was no LPG consumption in the grid.

The annual OM emission factors are calculated as follows (Table 13):
Table 13: Annual OM Emission Factors
2008 0.65959
2009 0.65195
2010 0.65670
Finally, OM emission factor is calculated as a generation weighted average for the three most recent
years. The resulting OM Emission Factor is;
EF = 0.65613 grid,OMsimple
Build margin (BM)
As mentioned above we have preferred the Option 1, calculating the Build Margin Emission factor, “ex
ante”, for the first crediting period.
Between the SET and SET , the sample group that comprises the larger annual generation is 5-units ≥20%
SET , hence the set of capacity additions in the electricity system that comprise 20% of the system ≥20%
generation is used.
The amount of electricity produced by the SET is calculated to be 4,288.65 GWh. (= AEG 5-units SET-5-
). units
The gross electricity generation in year 2010 is taken as reference for determination of plants that
comprise 20% of the system generation. The gross generation in year 2010 was 211,207.70 GWh
(Table 12) in 2010 out of this amount 7,053.40 GWh was identified30 to be produced by projects that

Capacity Projection report published by TEIAS (http://212.175.131.171/projeksiyon/KAPASITEPROJEKSIYONU2011.pdf). We
have checked and identified the ones that have claimed VERs by comparing the list to the Gold Standard registry

claimed VERs, excluding this number from the gross generation we end up with 195,992.70 GWh of
electricity which is our AEG and 20% of that amount is calculated as 39,198.54 GWh. TOTAL
Comparing the AEG and 20% of AEG , it is seen that 20% of AEG , is higher than SET-5-units TOTAL TOTAL
AEG SET-5-units.
Thereforethe 20% of AEG with a value of 39,198.54 GWh is to be compared to the capacity TOTAL
additions in the recent years.
Summing up electricity the generations of all the plants added to the Turkish National Grid in 2010
and 2009, but excluding the projects that claimed VERs, their total generation is 47,745.76 GWh.
The total generation by the power plants added in year 2010 is 26,256.04 GWh which is still less than
the 20% of AEG value of 39,198.54 GWh, however we are unable to identify the date of addition TOTAL
of the units that are added to the Grid in year 2009 to complete the amount of electricity added to the
Grid by year 2010 power plants. Therefore, with a conservative approach we are considering all the
units added in year 2009 and the AEG value we are using in our BM calculation is 47,745.76 SET Sample
GWh and is greater than the 20% of the total generation, So only the power plants added in the last 2
years, excluding those claiming VER credits, are used in the calculations. As there is no power unit
older than 10 years this number is being used for Build Margin Calculations.
The lists of most recent capacity additions to the grid by year and their average and firm generation
capacities for the years 2010, and 2009 are available as Annex-2 to the capacity projection reports
published in the TEIAS web page. Also the annual generation capacity data for each plant is not
available on the statistics page of TEİAŞ. The data for the years 200931 and 201032 are taken from
the TEİAŞ Capacity Projection Reports which are also available in another section of the TEİAŞ
website. For the capacity additions, the firm generation capacities of the power plants are used. The
units that are taken out of the grid are not taken into consideration. All the data used for calculations
could be found in Annex-2 (see Table 8a and Table8b).
According to the tool in terms of vintage of data, a project participant can choose either the ex-ante
option or the ex-post option. As explained above, out of these two options, Option 1 is selected. For
the first crediting period, the build margin emission factor is calculated ex-ante based on the most
recent information available on units already built for sample group m at the time of CDM-PDD
submission to the DOE for validation. For the second crediting period, the build margin emission
factor will be updated based on the most recent information available on units already built at the time
of submission of the request for renewal of the crediting period to the DOE. For the third crediting
period, the build margin emission factor calculated for the second crediting period will be used. This
option does not require monitoring the emission factor during the crediting period.
Electric efficiency rates
There is no complete and up-to-date data regarding the electrical efficiency of thermal power plants
that supply electricity to the Turkish National Grid system. Therefore the default values provided in
Annex 1(Default efficiency factors for power plants) of the Methodological Tool to calculate the
emission factor for an electricity system (Version 3.0.0) (EB 70, Annex 22) is utilised, in a very

baseline from an intentional decline in livestock in the project area (note, not from forage
improvement), ie PEM – BEM < 0, this GHG removal must be conservatively excluded to avoid t

Long-term average
As part of an afforestation reforestation for commercial timber and rotation cycles, the
calculations have been done based on the AFOLU Requirements and guidance for calculating the
Long-Term Average Carbon Stock (LTA) for ARR Projects with Harvesting26, This includes all carbon
pools in the project.
The calculation of the LTA was made for each stratum, including above and belowground biomass,
SOC and excluding baseline, as presented in the table below. The complete tables for all ten
strata can be found in the Excel Ex-Ante San Pedro – 1st project instance.

EIA submission36.
The project activity does not involve any major construction activity. It primarily
requires the installation of the Wind Electric Generators, interfacing the generators
with the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board, Hubli Electricity Supply Company Limited
(HESCOM) and Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company Limited (GESCOM) by setting
up HT transmission lines and installation of other accessories.
However, there are no negative impacts on air, water, soil quality and ambience are
envisaged due to the project activity.

7 The change in net emissions has been corrected to account for the fact that there are time periods (after year 60) for
which the net change is negative. The cumulative corrected values are only allowed to reach the maximum 100-­‐year value
(1,512,849 t) and then forced to 0.

Calculation of Net Emissions Reductions
The annual net carbon emissions reductions is the actual net GHG removals by sinks from the project
scenario minus the net GHG removals by sinks from the baseline scenario, were then calculated by
applying the leakage and uncertainty discount factors (but not the VCS permanence buffer), on an
annualized basis:
ER = ER - LE (58) y y,GROSS y
Where,
ER = the net GHG emissions reductions and/or removals in year y (the overall annual carbon change y
between the baseline and project scenarios, net all discount factors except the permanence buffer) (t
CO e yr-1). 2
ER =the difference in the overall annual carbon change between the baseline and project y,GROSS
scenarios (t CO e yr-1). 2
LE = Leakage in year y (t CO e yr-1), as calculated in equation 56b. y 2
This calculation occurs within the Afognak Carbon Model Spreadsheet, using the data shown in Table
12 and Table 13.
Calculation of Voluntary Credit Units (VCUs)
The number of VCU’s the Afognak carbon project generates as available for issuance and sale in year,
y (VCU ; t CO e yr-1), is calculated as: y 2
VCU = ER (cid:79)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:13)(cid:1)– ER ) – BR (59) y y y,ERR y
Where,
ER = the net GHG emissions reductions and/or removals in year (t CO e yr-1), as calculated in equation y 2
58.
ER = the uncertainty factor for year, y, (calculated in Section 4.5), expressed as a proportion. y,ERR
BR = estimated VCU-equivalent tCO e issued to the VCS Buffer Pool in year, y, calculated using the y 2
latest version of the VCS Tool for AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Analysis and Buffer (Voluntary
Carbon Standard, 2008c). BRy is calculated by multiplying the most current verified permanence risk
Buffer Withholding Percentage for the project by the change in carbon stocks (difference between
baseline and project scenario) for the project area.
The VCS Buffer Discount Factor (BR ) was calculated as 13%, as per the non-permanence risk Y
assessment in Appendix 1. The BR factor will be re-assessed at each verification as necessary.
The uncertainty factor was conservatively estimated at 11.9%, as per Section 4.5. The uncertainty
factor will be re-calculated from field plot data at each verification.

Ex-ante estimates are provided in Table 13. below. These ex-ante estimates are for the entire
designated geographic area based on BEM estimates for the first PAI in Kamlapar. This assumes that
future PAIs will have similarly stocked forests and harvest areas to this first PAI, which may not be the
case due to uncertainty for future PAIs. However, per the methodology, ex-ante estimates are only
required to determine whether changes within carbon pools or increased GHG emissions due to project
activities are insignificant. As the project has only conservatively excluded selected pools such as SDW
and LDW will account for all significant emissions due to project activities, these ex-ante estimates are
only meant to provide potential crediting estimates across the project lifetime.
Estimated baseline emissions will change as future PAIs are added to the project. The addition of future
PAIs will require delineation of the area of the PAA as well as an inventory of carbon stocks within that
specific PAA. Thus, reported baseline emissions are only an estimate that assumes that future PAIs will
have similar areas and carbon stocks to the original PAI. This design for estimating ex-ante baseline
emissions across all PAIs is the same as was done for ex-ante project emissions (see Section 4.2.4).
Future reported baseline emissions will likely change significantly at verification events due to the
addition of new PAIs and inventory results. Project emissions will vary based on actual monitored
disturbances within each PAA.

According to the applied methodology AMS-Ⅲ.AU (version 4.0), for the ex-ante estimation of
emission reductions within the project design document prior to the project implementation,
project proponent shall refer to own field experiments or estimate baseline and project emissions
with the help of national data or IPCC tier 1 default values for emission and scaling factors.
In this project, using the IPCC tier 1 approach but undertaking measurements to determine
baseline emission factors for continuously flooded fields, as per the following formula:
ER = EF ×A ×L ×10−3 ×GWP Equation (6) y ER y y CH4
EF = EF −EF Equation (7) ER BL P

Determination of EF BL, c
However, the baseline emission factor for continuously flooded fields without organic
amendments (EF ) can be determined ex-ante prior to the start of the project activity, in this BL,c
case, the ex-ante value should be used to calculate emission reduction during the crediting
period. It should be measured by using Closed Chamber in three reference fields which are
chosen in the project area.
According to the guidance on methane measurement in the appendix of AMS-III.AU Methodology,
the implementation of methane measurement in rice fields requires the involvement of experts
in this field or at least experienced staff trained by experts (i.e., from research institutions). These
guidelines cannot replace expertise in setting up chamber measurements. They rather set
minimum requirements that serve for standardizing the conditions under which methane
emissions are measured for projects under this methodology.
The Closed Chamber measurement requires the cooperation of the experts from Huazhong
Agricultural University and the staff of the Agricultural and Rural Committee of Dazu District.
Huazhong Agricultural University is a comprehensive agricultural research institution directly
under the provincial government. The expert set up the chamber measurements on 14-May-2017.
All the sample fields are in Sanqu Town, Dazu District. A total of 9 chambers were set up in three
baseline fields, three in each field. The base is embedded just before transplanting, and the first
gas sampling began on the second day after transplanting, followed by sampling every 7days.
After sampling, as is stored in the evacuated vial, and the samples collected after three times
should be taken together for laboratory analysis.
1) Project proponent shall prepare a detailed plan for the seasonal methane measurements
before the start of the season. The plan shall include the schedule for the field and laboratory
measurements, the logistics that are necessary to get the gas samples to the laboratory and
a cropping calendar. The plan shall also include all reference field specific information
regarding location and climate, soil, water management, plant characteristics, fertilizer
treatment and organic amendments.
19 For all scaling factor used in this methodology, the average values in 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
are chosen.

4.4 Estimated Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
Baseline net GHG removals and total GHG emissions due to leakage are zero, thus ex-ante estimation of
C AR−CDM equals ΔC ACTUAL.
According to VCS version 3 AFOLU requirements, the amount of carbon credits must not exceed the long
term GHG benefit of the project. The period over which the long-term average GHG benefit is calculated
is 101 years (including the last harvest/cut in the cycle). The total LTA benefit, calculated as VCS
requirements along the 101 year period, is 2,021,823 t CO2, when divided by 100 years (total number of
crediting years) results in 20,218 tCO2/year.
As per VCS Standard v4.3, the following equation was used to calculate the long-term average GHG
benefit:
∑𝑛 𝑃𝐸 −𝐵𝐸 𝐿𝐴 = 𝑡=0 𝑡 𝑡
𝑛
Where:
𝐿𝐴 = The long-term average GHG benefit
𝑃𝐸 = The total to-date GHG emission reductions and removals generated in the project 𝑡
scenario (tCO2e).
𝐵𝐸 = The total to-date GHG emission reductions and removals projected for the baseline 𝑡
scenario (tCO2e)
𝑡 = Year
𝑛 = Total number of years in the established time period

activities
A reduction in carbon stocks due to activities carried out in leakage management areas is not
expected as no activities of agricultural improvement or management of grazing areas able to alter
carbon stocks and increase GHG emissions as compared with baseline scenario in leakage management
areas is planned to be implemented. However, if it is decided that such activities are necessary, then the
ex ante carbon stock changes and GHG emissions associated to such activities will be estimated as per
step 8 of the methodology VM0015, and if significant they will be monitored and data will be made
available to the verification body at each verification event using Tables 30b, 30c, 31, 32 and 33 of
methodology VM0015 version 1.1.
The following activities in leakage management areas could occasion a decrease in carbon stocks
or an increase in GHG emissions:
• Carbon stock changes due to activities implemented in leakage management areas;
• Methane (CH ) and nitrous oxide (N O) emissions from livestock intensification (involving 4 2
a change in the animal diet and/or animal numbers).

determined in the AFOLU non-permanence risk report attached as a separate document).
Therefore, the total number of buffer credits that need to be deposited into the AFOLU pooled
buffer account is 254 tCO2e. The number of GHG credits eligible to be issued as VCUs for the
first project instances of this monitoring period is 1,440 tCO2e. The current emission reductions
have not yet reached the Long-Term Average (1,694 tCO2e < 205,762 tCO2e).

The project activity reduces carbon dioxide emissions through displacement of grid electricity
generation with predominantly fossil fuel based power plants5 by renewable electricity. The
emission reduction ER y due to project activity during a given year y is estimated as the

5 Environmental Impact:
As per the prevailing local /host country laws no environmental impact assessment is
required, (the Schedule 1 of Ministry of Environment and Forests (Government of
India) notification dated September 14, 2006), 38 activities are required to undertake
environmental impact assessment studies. The details of these activities are available at
http://envfor.nic.in/legis/eia/so1533.pdf.
However the project participant has carried out Aspect and Impact analysis of all the
activities of the project and concluded that there is no negative environmental impact

Significance Assessment (Step 9.1 VM0015 v1.0)
The sources of GHG emissions considered in the PCFS (above- and below-ground biomass - see Table 16
Methodology VM0015 v1.0) are significant, as demonstrated by applying the ""Tool for Testing Significance of
GHG Emissions in A/R CDM Project Activities,"" where the above-ground biomass accounts for 74.5% of the
expected emissions in the baseline scenario and below-ground biomass accounts for the remaining
90

VCS Project Description Template
25.5%. Both sources, therefore, show a significance level >5% and thus will be considered in calculations of
reductions in net GHG emissions by project activities.
For the project baseline scenario, the significance level was calculated for potential emission sources as well
as activities that may decrease the emissions expected in the baseline scenario; these are, respectively: (i)
CH emissions from biomass burning and (ii) decrease in emissions expected in the baseline scenario, by 4
logging without the use of fire (durable goods). Was also calculated the significance of a possible emission
source that could lead to a reduction in avoided emissions under the PCFS scenario: (i) emissions from
deforestation in leakage management areas.
Below, an analysis of identified emissions sources.
Baseline Scenario
(I) CH4 from burning biomass
To determine the significance of CH4 emitted through the burning of biomass, we used the equation
presented in Step 6.2 of the Methodology VM0015 v1.0:
(10)
Whereby:
EBBCO2icl, t = CO2 emissions per hectare from burning of biomass per forest class in year t icl: *
CO2e ha-1
EBBCH4icl, t = CH4 emissions per hectare from burning of biomass per forest class in year t icl: *
CO2e ha-1
ERCH4 = Emission rate for CH4 (IPCC default value = 0.012).
GWPCH4 = Global Warming Potential for CH4 (IPCC default value = 21 for the first commitment
period).
The result of this equation gives the value of 52.53 tCO2e*ha-1. However, a combustion efficiency of 50% is
assumed (Step 6.2, VM0015 v1.0 ) such that CH4 emissions represent 4.6% of the emissions per hectare.
This source has been shown not significant and conservatively will not be counted as an avoided emission in
the PCFS.
(ii) Durable Wood Products
We calculated the significance level of potential logging that does not use fire (eg. for the production of
durable goods like furniture, etc.) and hence does not produce GHG emissions. To perform the calculations
we used the following assumptions:
 Net Emission Factor per hectare: 586.8 tCO2
 Logging intensity 30m3/ha141
 Coefficient of volumetric efficiency: 45%142
 Wood density = 0.59 t/m3 143
 Carbon density = 0.485 tC / t biomass144
 Conversion factor for CO e = 44/12145 2

142 CONAMA, 2009
143 Nogueira, 2008
144 Silva, 2007
145 IPCC, 2006
91

VCS Project Description Template
 Permanence factor of CO e by the use of wood in durable goods: 30m3/ha * 45% * 0.59 * 0.485 2
* 3.666 = 14.16 tCO2e/ha
 Calculation of the significance level: 14.16 tCO2 / 586.8 tCO2 = 0.024 (2.4%)
And, it is assumed that logging would occur at an average intensity of 30m3/ha, according to known
exploitation intensitiesin tropical forests. Of total production, wood represents 45% of the extracted volume.
By applying the values for wood density and the carbon content of the biomass, the amount of carbon
removed from the forest for the production of durable goods may be estimated.
It is important to point out that the logging intensity values used here are extremely conservative because in
a degraded forest as found in TISS, a logging intensity of 30m3/ha of commercial species is unlikely.
The result of the calculation of significance (2.4%) indicates that this activity will not be counted because it is
below the level of significance established by the Methodology VM0015 v1.0.
PCFS Scenario
(I) Leakage Management Areas
As previously mentioned, it is expected that with project implementation there will be an increase of carbon
stocks in areas under leakage management as reforestation and agroforestry activities will be encouraged
and promoted by the project proponents.
If a very pessimistic scenario is assumed, whereby carbon stocks in leakage management areas totaling
3,416 ha decreased by 50% (from 47 tCO2/ha to 23.5 tCO2/ha) through deforestation caused by the Paiter-
Suruí, the total emissions from this loss would represent 4.0% of expected emission reductions in the project
scenario (per hectare) and therefore is not considered significant and will not be counted as an potential
emission source in the project scenario.

2 The earliest start date of rice cropping season among farmers which are recorded in the Farmers’ database.
3 The project lifetime is based on the design life of the ditches. The design lifetime of the water ditches in this project is 30
years, so the project lifetime is 30 years. The start date is based on the acceptance date from the “Completion acceptance
form of High-standard rice construction project in Yongchuan District”. The construction of ditches, reservoirs, and valves was
carried out on the original land, and no more land was occupied. Therefore, the project did not cause a native ecosystem
conversion.
4 Section 3.8 of the VCS Standard v4.2 states that “The project crediting period is the time for which GHG emission reductions
or removals generated by the project are eligible for issuance as VCUs.” According to the Methodology of Methane emission
reduction by adjusted water management practice in rice cultivation, the time when the project produces emission
reductions is the start time of land preparation. And the land preparation means the start of a rice season. The main activity
of this project is emission reduction due to the adjusted water regime during rice cultivation, which means emission

and/or removal enhancements:
The project activity under consideration entails electricity generation through wind-
mills by harnessing wind power potential, a natural and renewable source of energy.
The project is expected to generate and export 29.01 million kWh (approx) of power
per year to the Southern Regional Grid of India. In the absence of the project activity,
an equivalent quantity of electricity would have been generated by the Southern Grid
by a majority of fossil-fuel fired power plants. The same would have resulted in GHG
emissions as per the carbon intensity of the grid-mix.
As per the combined margin, carbon intensity of 0.927 tCO /MWh for the Southern 2
Grid has been used during calculation of emission reductions. The bundled project
activity would there by result in total CO emission reduction of 269, 050 tonnes over 2
the crediting period of 10 years. For detailed calculation procedure and sample
calculation tables of the GHG emission reduction, please refer to the Sections 4.2,",Get all the yearly Estimated GHG Emission Reductions or Removals records for this project.

The tool for “Estimation of non-CO GHG emissions resulting from burning of biomass attributable to an 2
A/R CDM project activity” has been considered. The use of fire for site preparation and/or to clear the land
of harvest residue prior to replanting is specifically excluded from the project management and therefore
project emissions are estimated as zero.
Carbon stock changes
ΔC is the sum of the changes in above-ground and below-ground tree biomass, dead wood, litter and soil P
organic carbon stocks in the project scenario. For ex-ante estimation, dead wood and litter pools were
conservatively neglected. Calculations for tree biomass (above and below) and soil organic carbon are
described below.
Biomass carbon pools
Above and below ground biomass have been estimated according to the tool “Estimation of carbon stocks
and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in A/R CDM project activity”. A summary of the main
factors used and each source of data are presented in the table below. Estimations are archived as part of
the project documentation and will be available for the validation team. Data used for estimating tree

Soil organic carbon
Estimations of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks were done in accordance to the “Tool for the estimation of
change in soil organic carbon stocks due to the implementation of A/R CDM project activity”. As suggested
by the tool, it is assumed that the implementation of the project activity increases the SOC content of the
lands from the pre-project level to the level that is equal to the steady-state SOC content under native
vegetation. The increase in SOC content in the project scenario takes place at a constant rate over a period
of 20 years from the year of planting. The project meets the applicability conditions of this tool since:
 the areas of land to which the tool is applied do not fall into wetland category, do not contain organic
soils and are not subject to any of the land management practices and application of inputs listed
in Tables 1 and 2 of the tool;
 Since the land use prior to project start is grassland, only Table 2 applies. For the temperate warm
moist climate region corresponding to the project activity, none of the three combinations included
in Table 2 are applicable;
 litter remains on site and is not removed and soil disturbance is in accordance with appropriate
conservation practices, limited to site preparation and not repeated within 20 years.
Table 13. Parameters used for estimation of SOC
SOC at the beginning of the project (SOC ) is estimated by multiplying the factors in Table 13 by the INITIAL,i
reference SOC. As per the tool, a loss in SOC (SOC ) is applied in the case that soil disturbance occurs LOSS,i
on more than 10 per cent of the land area, which is the case of Guanaré/FAS project. The following
methodological formula is used for calculating the annual change in SOC stock:

In accordance with the selected CDM methodology, the greenhouse gas emissions of the proposed project
activities can be neglected (Section I, paragraph 3). However, in the framework of the VCS, relevant
greenhouse gas emissions of the baseline scenario shall be considered (VCS 2007.1, paragraph 6.3.1).
The baseline studies made by CIRAD (200040; 200141) first described the activities present in the
reference scenario and the project scenario (Table 9) within project boundary, and then listed all GHG
sources related to the activities approached (Table 10).
Table 9: Activities of reference scenario and project scenario.
Table 10: Carbon pools and GHG sources of reference scenario and project scenario.
Emissions from combustion of fossil fuel
The combustion of fossil fuels occurs in both reference and project scenario but the related GHG
emissions are supposed to be higher in the project scenario because of additional activities (reforestation
activities). However, they should be very low and negligible in comparison with CO removals from 2
forest plantations.
The GHG emissions were calculated by following IPCC GL 2006 with the date monitored in the fazenda.
Every year, 2’000 liters of diesel oil are consumed by project activities. Depending on years, a trade-off
exists between activities but global consumption remains similar. By applying IPCC method and default
values (EF = 2.707 kgCO .L-1), a total of 54.14 tCO were emitted during the last 10 years, since Diesel oil 2 2
project start. If this result is compared to the GHG emissions from fossil fuel combustion of the reference
scenario, the net GHG emissions can reasonably be neglected.

In the reference scenario, with the continuation of cattle grazing activities, annual fire is a common
practice for pasture management. Fire is used each year in order to stimulate growth of grasses. In terms
of greenhouse gas, CO , CH , CO, NO and N O are emitted. While CO emissions are compensated by 2 4 x 2 2
the regrowth of grasses, the other GHG emissions remain in the atmosphere, representing a GHG source.
In the project scenario such practice is not used as pastures are converted to forest lands. Thus, GHG
emissions from biomass burning in the reference scenario are net GHG emissions, but if accidental fires
occur in the project area. Therefore GHG emissions from biomass burning could represent a relevant
GHG source.
However, such emissions need large amount of biomass burning to be significant. As an example CH is 4
the main GHG released during biomass burning with an emission factor of 67 g.(kg d.m)-1, in comparison
with other GHG that have emissions factors lower than 4 g.(kg d.m)-1. Considering a hypothetical initial
biomass of 30 t d.m.ha-1 in pasture of the project area, which is high, the CH released during biomass 4
burning of the whole project area would be 16 tCO -e each year. Therefore, as GHG emissions from 2
fossil fuel combustion, GHG emissions from biomass burning can reasonably be neglected.
Emissions from enteric fermentation
This item represents the major GHG source inside project in the baseline scenario. As mentioned above,
3’960 heads of cattle pre-existed before project start and then were killed at project start. Thus, the
difference between GHG emissions from enteric fermentation in the reference scenario shall be
significant compared with project scenario.
However, in the project scenario, some animals of neighboring fazendas are present inside project area.
The neighboring animals are authorized inside project area for weed control and to generate additional
incomes from land renting. Thus, some cattle are still present inside project area with a low mean annual
presence of 822 heads since project start.
Therefore, even with animals still present inside project area, the difference of GHG emissions from
enteric fermentation between reference scenario and project scenario will be significant, as a
buffalo emits more than 1 tCO -e.year-1, and therefore will be estimated following IPCC GL 2006 in 2
accordance with VCS recommendations.
Emissions from the decomposition of dead wood
Dead wood is a main compartment in the reference scenario and the project scenario as natural forest was
slashed and burnt by the former landowner in order to open pastures for cattle grazing activities, and the
lying dead wood left on site.
In the reference scenario, dead wood is burnt year after year through pasture management by fire. The
remaining burnt dead wood participates to the process of decomposition. In the project scenario the dead
wood is neither displaced nor burnt. Therefore, it completely participates to the process of decomposition.
In consequence, it can reasonably be argued that GHG emissions from dead wood burning in the
reference scenario are almost equivalent to GHG emissions from dead wood decomposition in the project
scenario considering that CH is the main GHG involved in both processes. 4
Moreover, the inputs of dead wood from the management of forest plantations shall not lead to significant
additional GHG emissions considering the low amounts of GHG released during decomposition of dead

Estimating carbon stock in trees at a point in time:
To estimate the carbon stock in tree biomass at a point in time. the following tool was used: “Estimation of
carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in A/R CDM project activities AR-TOOL14
Version 04.1”. According to section 8.2 of this tool. this method is used for ex-ante estimation (projection)
of carbon stock in tree biomass. Under this method. existing data are used in combination with tree
growth models to predict the growth of trees and the development of the tree stand over time.
- Step 1: Tree carbon estimation
According to point 6 of Annex 1 of the AR-TOOL 14, for ex-ante estimation the allometric equation
applied to a tree species shall be selected from the following sources:
a) Existing data applicable to local situation (e.g. represented by similar ecological conditions).
b) National data (e.g. from national forest inventory or national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory).
c) Data from neighbouring countries with similar conditions.
d) Globally applicable data.
An equation for H. Brasilensis derived from national inventories has not been developed for Colombia.
The equation available for this specie in the country depends on allometric parameters and there is not an

similar conditions was used96.
Table 14 shows the carbon accumulation model (Car) for Hevea brasiliensis and its respective
parameters. Parameters were estimated calculated by Wauters et al. (2008)97through the adjustment of a
Gompertz model, which matched the evolution of carbon stocks in total tree as a function of stand age.
The Gompertz equation was fitted with 80 data from Mato Grosso, Brazil. This site has not the same, but
similar environmental conditions to the project area: annual rainfall ranges from 1,500 to 2,000 mm and
annual temperature between 20 and 25 °C.

- Step 4: soil organic carbon
Estimations of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks were done in accordance to the ―Tool for the estimation
of change in soil organic carbon stocks due to the implementation of A/R CDM project activity version
1.1.0‖ (Annex 12). As suggested by the tool. it is assumed that the implementation of the project activity
increases the SOC content of the lands from the pre-project level to the level that is equal to the steady-
state SOC content under native vegetation. The increase in SOC content in the project scenario takes
place at a constant rate over a period of 20 years from the year of planting. The project meets the
applicability conditions of this tool in the area managed with rubber plantations:
The areas of land to which the tool is applied do not fall into wetland category, do not contain organic
soils and are not subject to any of the land management practices and application of inputs listed in
Tables 1 and 2 of the tool.
Since the land use prior to project start was grassland, only Table 2 applies. For the Tropical, moist
climate region corresponding to the project activity, none of the three combinations included in Table 15
are applicable; litter remains on site and is not removed and soil disturbance is in accordance with
appropriate conservation practices, limited to site preparation and less than 10%. As the main goal of the
project is not the wood harvesting, but the rubber. Not additional site preparations will be developed at
least for the first 35 years of the rubber productivity cycle (less than 20 years).
The initial SOC stock at the start of the Project is estimated as follows:
(4)
= SOC stock at the beginning of the A/R CDM project activity in stratum
i of the areas of land; t C ha-1
= Reference SOC stock corresponding to the reference condition in
native lands (i.e. non-degraded. unimproved lands under native
vegetation ñ normally forest) by climate region and soil type
applicable to stratum i of the areas of land; t C ha-1
= Relative stock change factor for baseline land-use in stratum i of the
areas of land; dimensionless
= Relative stock change factor for baseline management regime in
stratum i of the areas of land; dimensionless
= Relative stock change factor for baseline input regime (e.g. crop
residue returns. manure) in stratum i of the areas of land;
dimensionless
= 1. 2. 3. … strata of areas of land; dimensionless

4.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
The net GhG emissions reductions can be found in column AW, ""PA Summary"" worksheet. It
reflects the emission reductions calculated from the ""Ex-Post Strata"" worksheet, less the Pending

3.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
The net anthropogenic GHG removals by the project shall be calculated as follows:
(1)
Where:
= Net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t CO -e 2
= Actual net GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t CO -e 2
= Baseline net GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t CO -e 2
= GHG emissions due to leakage, in year t; t CO -e 2
From the previous calculation on baseline emissions and leakage emissions, we learn that
estimated baseline emissions and estimated leakage emissions are both 0tCO e for the project. 2
The net anthropogenic GHG removals by the project are summarized below.

Wind power is one of the cleanest sources of renewable energy, with no
associated emissions and waste products. As per the Schedule 1 of Ministry
of Environment and Forests (Government of India) notification9 dated
September 14, 2006, wind power projects do not require an Environmental
Impact Assessment. However, certain foreseen impacts due to the project
activity are discussed below:
Noise Pollution
Most of the wind turbines are in isolated areas or on designated wind zones
and hence do not cause any concern to the residents of the area. In the same
vein, construction activities also have not caused noise pollution due to the
isolated nature of the area.
Water Pollution
There is no gaseous, liquid or solid effluent from the Wind Turbine
Generators. Hence there is no contamination of water bodies due to
operation of Wind Turbine Generators.
Air Pollution
Minimal air pollution might have occurred during the construction of the
Project due to transportation. However, these were not found to affect the
surrounding persons nor the environment in any significant manner. Wind

energy plants are known to contribute to zero atmospheric pollution as no
fuel combustion is involved during any stage of the operation.
Hence it can be concluded that there are no negative impacts associated
with the mentioned Project.
5 Environmental Impact:

The total net of GHG reductions of the REDD Project are calculated as follows:
C = ∆C - ∆C - ∆C REDD,t BSL P LK
Where,
C = Total GHG emission reduction REDD,t
∆C = Net emissions under baseline BSL
∆C = Net emissions under project scenario P
∆C = Net emissions by leakage LK
As shown in the calculations developed, there is no variation in carbon stocks by deforestation in
the with-project case (ex-ante), as the Madre de Dios Amazon REDD Project will carry out
activities to avoid the projected deforestation in 100%. On the other hand, there is no sufficiently
reliable estimation about the increase in biomass by the actions of enrichment in the Project Area.
v3.0 1 61

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
Therefore, based on the monitoring to be carried out calculations ex post will be made for this
item.
The emissions due to leakage inside and outside the Leakage Belt that have been calculated
following Module LK-ASU amount to 816,783.62 tCO for the first 10 years. The percentages and 2
indexes found in the different steps of the estimation are based in the analysis of the official
information on the population, as the National Census of 2007 and current studies of the area
carried out by NGO’s and different researchers.
Therefore, the Total Reduction of GHGs Emissions in the Project Area would be equal to
10,603,153 tCO2 (11.419.937 - 816,783.62 tCO2) for the first ten years and 25,072,135 tCO2 for
the entire life of the project. However, the project should be monitored to verify stock changes by
deforestation (unlikely to occur) and if the leakage established (ex-ante) is in fact attributable to
the project or the amount has been overestimated and increase the carbon stock in a project
scenario by enrichment in the project area.
Estimation on the VCS buffer
The Buffer retention is estimated as a percentage of the subtraction between the Total Emissions
by Unplanned Deforestation in Baseline and the Emissions in the Scenario with Project,
regardless of the discounts by leakage. Previously, each one has to subtract their emissions by
burning of fossil fuels and the incorporation of nitrogen.
The retention rate is determined according to the risk classification of the project, using the VCS
tool for AFOLU of Risk of Non Permanence. According to the calculations, it has a total
percentage of 10% buffer.
Therefore the retention of Buffer Credits to year 2018 should be:
Buffer = {(11,419,937 – 0*) – 0**} x 10% = 1,141,994 tCO UNPLANNED 2
And to 2046 (end of the accreditation period):
Buffer = {(27,626,600 – 0*) – 0**} x 10% = 2,762,660 tCO UNPLANNED 2
* It was already explained that the emissions due to the burning of fossil fuels and the
incorporation of nitrogen fertilizers in baseline were not considered.
** There are no changes in carbon stocks in Scenario with Project (ex - ante) due to the planned
prevention activities, and because none of them have considered using fertilizers.
Uncertainty Analysis
The analysis of uncertainty of carbon stocks was developed according to the module X-UNC.
The assumptions made were:
v3.0 1 62

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
- The uncertainty from emissions should be accounted as zero, since we used a conservative
number (55%) in its calculation, and it is the percentage taken from literature.
- The uncertainty from Pools: Dead-wood, Litter, Soil organic, Wood products; and sources:
Fossil fuel combustion and N O emissions from nitrogen application, were not analysed as 2
they are not included in baseline calculations.
- The uncertainty resulting from calculations to estimate aboveground biomass, based on
measured tree variables (DBH, specific density), is already included in the biomass equation
itself
Estimation of Verified Carbon Units
- Considering what is indicated in the module, to know the verifiable carbon units in time t, the
adjustment by uncertainty should be carried out as well as the reduction by risk buffer. For
the development of this item it has been estimated the VCU of each year, as evidenced in the
table below.

The closed chamber measurement requires the involvement of technicians trained by expert
from Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences under the jurisdiction of the Anhui Agricultural
Bureau. Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences is a comprehensive agricultural research
institution directly under the provincial government. The expert who is the leader of the
experiment has a doctoral degree and her field of study is rice cultivation and GHG
monitoring33 . The chamber measurements were conducted by technicians trained by the
expert on 07 March 2017 for the early season and 10 July 2017 for the second season,
respectively34. The base is embedded just before transplanting, and the first gas sampling
began on the second day after transplanting, followed by sampling every 7 days. After
sampling, the gas is stored in the evacuated vial, and the samples collected after three times
should be taken together for laboratory analysis.

measurements before the start of the season. The plan shall include the schedule for the
field and laboratory measurements, the logistics that are necessary to get the gas
samples to the laboratory and a cropping calendar. The plan shall also include all
reference field specific information regarding location and climate, soil, water
management, plant characteristics, fertilizer treatment and organic amendments.

The ex ante projections assume that no deforestation, or other sources of emissions, occurs in the project
in the with-project case, i.e. that park protection activities are successful in preventing land clearing within
the park boundary. Park protection and border patrolling, as well as community awareness programs, are
key components to the project implementation. CIMA has a proven track record from 2003 to 2008, of
effective protection work and conflict resolution.
There are no standard approaches to estimate future leakage attributable to a REDD activity, nor does
the methodology provide detailed guidance. Some leakage due to the project is expected. However, as
detailed in the project description, project implementation focuses on activities that should reduce
leakage, including support to potential leakage agents (i.e. communities in the park buffer zone) in
increasing crop productivity, land zoning and securing land tenure. To be conservative, a 20% annual
leakage rate is used.

Determination of
However, the bas𝑬𝑬e𝑬𝑬lin𝑩𝑩 e𝑩𝑩, 𝒄𝒄 emission factor for continuously flooded fields without organic
amendments ( ) can be determined ex ante prior to the start of the project activity, in
this case, the ex ante value should be used to calculate emission reduction during the 𝐵𝐵𝐸𝐸𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵,𝑐𝑐
crediting period. It should be measured by using closed chamber in three reference fields
which are chosen in the project area.
According to the guidance on methane measurement in the appendix of AMS-III.AU
Methodology, the following requirements should be met.
1. The implementation of methane measurement in rice fields requires the
involvement of experts in this field or at least experienced staff trained by experts
(i.e. from research institutions). These guidelines cannot replace expertise in
setting up chamber measurements. They rather set minimum requirements that
serve for standardizing the conditions under which methane emissions are
measured for projects under this methodology.
The closed chamber measurement requires the involvement of technicians trained by
experts from Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences under the jurisdiction of the Anhui
Agricultural Bureau. Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences is a comprehensive
agricultural research institution directly under the provincial government. The expert who is
the leader of the experiment has a doctoral degree and her field of study is rice cultivation
and GHG monitoring32. The base was buried in the rice field by technicians trained by
expert on 8 March 2017 for the early season and 9 July 2017 for the second season,
respectively33. The base is embedded just before transplanting, and the first gas sampling
began on the second day after transplanting, followed by sampling every 7 days. After
sampling, the gas is stored in the evacuated vial, and the samples collected after three
times should be taken together for laboratory analysis.
31 For all scaling factor used in this methodology, the average values in 2006 IPCC Guidelines for
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories are chosen.

Biodiversity Monitoring Plan (B4.1, B4.2, GL1.4, GL3.4)
Indicators are important in impact assessment because they respond to the basic question “what
should be measured to show that the claimed net social benefits are real and additional?” (Richards &
Panfil 2011) An ideal indicator from the perspective of showing attribution is one that measures an
‘intermediate state’ or assumption between an output and outcome or an outcome and an impact,
clearly showing progress along a causal chain (Richards & Panfil, 2011). Thus, we used our theory of
change logic in the Result Chain diagrams (section Error! Reference source not found.) as the basis
for selecting indicators that factor in attribution. We then decided on the best sampling methods to use
to collect these data to acceptable levels accuracy, precision and cost effectiveness whilst retaining
transparency and simplicity. From this, a Monitoring Plan was developed to guide data collection.
Further, the indicators will be analyzed based on the Pressure-State-Response framework, which also
relies on a causal-chain logic, where threats negatively impact the status/condition of biodiversity, while
87

Project Description: SD VISta Version 1
responses or project interventions reduce pressure. Most Response indicators can be grouped under:
Habitat improvement; Security enhancement; and Improvement of community livelihoods efforts.
Pressure indicators fall under: Human population size and dynamics; Human-wildlife conflict (HWC);
and Incidences including poaching, grazing, encroachment, charcoal and firewood collection amongst
others. Finally, State indicators are grouped into three categories: wildlife (including species presence,
diversity, distribution and movement); vegetation and land-use (including changes in various
vegetation/habitat types, encroachment and fire). Most of the response and pressure indicators
correspond to the social indicators developed in the community monitoring plan (See Section. 4.3.1),
and so data collection follows the protocols outlined therein. On top, we determined 12 indicators not
part of the social indicator set, also classified into three categories: Output 4; Outcome 4; and Impact.
For these new indicators, two main strategies will be used to obtain the data: In-house reporting and
Government records, mostly for output and outcome indicators, and surveys for most impact indicators.
We envision three main aspects of state indicators to measure, each with a distinct set of monitoring
protocols:
Wildlife: wildlife surveys and monitoring for all species – with a focus on HCVs – will be done using
several methods: ranger patrols, camera traps, fecal-DNA analysis, and information from any
independent research projects in the area
Vegetation and Land-use: carbon plot monitoring plots and remote sensing (based on LANDSAT
imagery) and GIS techniques.

JOINT PROJECT DESCRIPTION & MONITORING REPORT: VCS Version 3
Following sections 3.1.9 of AFOLU Requirements v3.5, as this is an ARR or IFM projects with harvesting
activities, it is necessary to calculate the long-term average GHG benefit maintained by the project. It is
necessary to demonstrate that GHG credits are not issued above this value. Calculations of the long-term
average GHG benefit have been done following Section 4.5.5. of AFOLU Requirements v3.5 in the Excel
file “Ex_ante_GHG_assessment” (worksheet Long Term Average). The long-term average GHG benefit
maintained by this project is 698,310 tCO e. 2

5.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
The net change in carbon stocks during the monitoring period was -48,837 tCO2e. The net
GhG emissions reductions can be found at the bottom of the ""PA Summary"" worksheet. It
reflects the emission reductions calculated from the ""Ex-Post Strata"" worksheet, less the
Pending and Removed PAs.
Two non-permanence risk reports were prepared under Section 2.1.3 of the AFOLU Non-
Permanence Risk Tool, v4.0. Due to the harvesting reported in this PD and the Loss
Report, 12 PAs were evaluated separately from the remainder. That risk report, Non-
Permanence Risk Sub-Report KE001-L, failed. But for the reversal in KE001-L, there
would have been an increase of 19,505 tonnes in the remainder of the PD and the risk
report for the remaining PAs had a risk of 1.0. However, since there was a reversal, KE
VCS-001 is not eligible for any credits. The non-permanence risk reports are Appendix 12.
The following is the verification history of KE VCS-001:

Determination of
However, the ba𝑬𝑬s𝑬𝑬e𝑩𝑩 l𝑩𝑩 in,𝒄𝒄 e emission factor for continuously flooded fields without organic

case, the ex ante value should be used to calculate emission reduction during the crediting 𝐵𝐵𝐸𝐸𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵,𝑐𝑐
period. It should be measured by using closed chamber in three reference fields which are
chosen in the project area.
According to the guidance on methane measurement in the appendix of AMS-III.AU
Methodology, the following requirements should be met.
1. The implementation of methane measurement in rice fields requires the involvement
of experts in this field or at least experienced staff trained by experts (i.e. from
research institutions). These guidelines cannot replace expertise in setting up
chamber measurements. They rather set minimum requirements that serve for
standardizing the conditions under which methane emissions are measured for
projects under this methodology.
The closed chamber measurement requires the involvement of technicians trained by experts
from Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences under the jurisdiction of the Anhui Agricultural
Bureau. Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences is a comprehensive agricultural research
institution directly under the provincial government. The expert who is the leader of the
experiment has a doctoral degree and her field of study is rice cultivation and GHG
monitoring36. The on-field gas samplings were conducted by technicians trained by expert,
which were started by using the closed chamber on 5 March 2017 for the early season and
10 July 2017 for the second season, respectively37 . The base is embedded just before
transplanting, and the first gas sampling began on the second day after transplanting,
followed by sampling every 7days. After sampling, the gas is stored in the evacuated vial,
and the samples collected after three times should be taken together for laboratory analysis.
2. Project proponents shall prepare a detailed plan for the seasonal methane
measurements before the start of the season. The plan shall include the schedule

Emission reductions due to the project activity during the year y are calculated as follows:

y y y
Where:
ER = Total emissions reductions during the year y in tons of CO 2 y
PE = Emissions from the project activity during the year y in tons of CO y 2
BE = Baseline emissions for the project activity during the year y in tons of CO 2, applicable
y to Scenario 2
Since PE is 0 (see 3.2 above), the emission reduction is equivalent to the determined baseline y
emissions.
Baseline emissions are calculated as per consolidated formula for calculation of baseline emissions (see
section 3.1 above). In ex-ante calculations here, the value f is assumed to be 1 (implying that all cap
accruing waste energy in considered years are equal or lower to historical level of last three years before
project implementation). The calculation reads as follows:

Emission Factor calculation (EF ) grid,CM,y
For calculation of the baseline emission factor, the six steps below should be followed as described
above:
STEP 1. Identify the relevant electricity system.
Considering the stated by the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system”, and the
fact that the Brazilian DNA has published the Resolution no 8 issued on May 26th, 2008, which defines
Brazilian Interconnected Grid as a single system that covers all five macro-geographical regions of the
51

Project Description: VCS Version 4.1
country (North, Northeast, South, Southeast and Midwest), the Brazilian electricity system boundaries
are clearly defined.
STEP 2. Choose whether to include off-grid power plants in the project electricity system (optional).
Since the Brazilian DNA has made available the emission factor calculation based on information of the
grid power plants only, the off-grid power plants are not considered.
STEP 3. Select a method to determine the operating margin (OM).
The method adopted to calculate the operating margin is “Dispatch data analysis OM”. The calculation
is performed by the Brazilian DNA and made publicly available.
The Dispatch Data emission factor (OM), is summarized as follows:
 EG ⋅EF
PJ,h EL,DD,h
EF = h
grid,OM−DD,y EG
PJ,y
Where:
EF = Dispatch data analysis operating margin CO emission factor in year y (tCO /MWh); grid,OM-DD,y 2 2
EG = Electricity displaced by the project activity in hour h of year y (MWh); PJ,h
EF = CO emission factor for grid power units in the top of the dispatch order in hour h in EL,DD,h 2
year y (tCO /MWh); 2
EG = Total electricity displaced by the project activity in year y (MWh). PJ,y
h = Hours in year y in which the project activity is displacing grid electricity (h)
y = Year in which the project activity is displacing grid electricity
STEP 4. Calculate the operating margin emission factor according to the selected method.
For effect of ex-ante estimation to EF value, was calculated the arithmetic average of 12 grid,OM-DD,y
months emission factors of the operating margin, published by the DNA (data available to year 2021).

Thus, the Emission Factor of Operating Margin is:
EF = 0. 5985 grid,OM-DD,y
STEP 5. Calculate the build margin (BM) emission factor.
The power units included in the build margin are defined by the Brazilian DNA who is responsible for
the operating margin and build margin calculations. The results of these are made publicly available in
its web site to consultation.
According to the used methodology, the build margin emission factor (BM) is calculated as follows:
 EG .EF
m,y EL,m,y
EF = i,m

For the build margin emission factor EF also will be adopted the 2020 year value published by grid,BM,y
the DNA.
Table 5: Latest data from Brazilian DNA to Emission Factor Build Margin (2021)
So, we have that the Build Margin Emission Factor is:
EF = 0.0540 grid,BM,y
STEP 6. Calculate the combined margin (CM) emission factor.
To calculation of combined margin emission factor (combination of operation and build margins) is
used a weighted-average formula, considering w = 0.25 and w = 0.75 (second credit period). As a OM BM

rounded down. Thus, the result is:
(cid:15)(cid:16) =0.5985⋅0.25+0.0540⋅0.75= 0.1901 (tCO /MWh) (cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:20),(cid:21)(cid:22),(cid:23) 2

In accordance with the applicability conditions of the required tool: “Estimation of the increase in
GHG emissions attributable to displacement of pre-project agricultural activities in A/R CDM
project activity”, SNP Patagonia Sur utilized the “Guidelines on conditions under which increase
in GHG emissions related to displacement of pre-project grazing activities in A/R CDM project
activity is insignificant” to demonstrate that leakage in the initial project activity instance is
insignificant. For evidence of the use of this tool and its guidance, please see supporting
document titled “Sec 1.13 Leakage Statement”.
Due to this assessment of insignificance, Equation (7) of the Baseline Methodology Procedure
was not used to calculate leakage (See supporting document titled “Sec 3 Baseline Procedure
Document”).

Determination of EFBL,c
However, the baseline emission factor for continuously flooded fields without organic
amendments ( ) can be determined ex ante prior to the start of the project activity, in this
case, the ex ante value should be used to calculate emission reduction during the crediting 𝐵𝐵𝐸𝐸𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵,𝑐𝑐
period. It should be measured by using closed chamber in three reference fields which are
chosen in the project area.
According to the guidance on methane measurement in the appendix of AMS-III.AU
Methodology, the following requirements should be met.
1. The implementation of methane measurement in rice fields requires the involvement of
experts in this field or at least experienced staff trained by experts (i.e. from research
institutions). These guidelines cannot replace expertise in setting up chamber measurements.
They rather set minimum requirements that serve for standardizing the conditions under
which methane emissions are measured for projects under this methodology.
The closed chamber measurement requires the involvement of technicians trained by experts
from Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences under the jurisdiction of the Anhui Agricultural
Bureau. Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences is a comprehensive agricultural research
institution directly under the provincial government. The expert who is the leader of the
experiment has a doctoral degree and her field of study is rice cultivation and GHG
monitoring34. The chamber measurements were conducted by technicians trained by expert
on 5 March 2017 for the early season and 10 July 2017 for the second season, respectively35.
The base is embedded just before transplanting, and the first gas sampling began on the
second day after transplanting, followed by sampling every 7days. After sampling, the gas is
stored in the evacuated vial, and the samples collected after three times should be taken
together for laboratory analysis.
2.Project proponents shall prepare a detailed plan for the seasonal methane measurements
before the start of the season. The plan shall include the schedule for the field and laboratory
measurements, the logistics that are necessary to get the gas samples to the laboratory and
a cropping calendar. The plan shall also include all reference field specific information
regarding location and climate, soil, water management, plant characteristics, fertilizer
treatment and organic amendments.

Ex-ante estimation of emission reductions is determined in (tCO2e) as the difference between the
ex-ante estimation of baseline emissions (ERy) and ex-ante estimations of leakage emissions

Ex-ante estimation of baseline emissions (ER ): y
By applying applicable approach of the methodological tool “Emissions from solid waste disposal
sites” (version 06.0.1)47 for estimating the amount of methane generated in the landfill during each
year of the 1st 7-year crediting period , ex-ante estimations of baseline emissions (BEy) are
determined (in tCO2e) as follows:
ER = ER_CH4 * GWP_CH4 y y
Where:
GWP_CH4 Global Warming Potential (GWP) of methane. GWP_CH4 is ex-ante determined as
21 tCO e/ tCH (default value) 2 4
ER_CH4 Methane emission reduction (in tCH ). In the context of the ex-ante estimation of y 4
emission reductions to be achieved by the project activity, ER_CH4 is estimated (in y
tCH )48 as follows: 4
ER_CH4 = CH4 – CH4 y flared,y baseline,y
Where:
CH4 = CH4 baseline,y contract,y
and
CH4   *BE /GWP_CH4
flared,y PJ CH4,SWDS,y
47 As one of the post-registration changes (under the category “Corrections (that do not affect the project design)”
which was addressed by the previously revised version of the PDD, the ex-ante estimations of emission
reductions to be achieved by the project activity during the 1st 7-year renewable crediting period were revised.
This revision was due to the following aspects:
- Application of more accurate values for organic content and amount of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW)
historically disposed at the AMC landfill;
- Use of more appropriate approach for estimating the amount of methane to be generated at the AMC
landfill and to be collected by the project activity. Such estimations are performed by applying a more recent
and appropriated approach as per the methodological tool “Emission from solid waste disposal sites”
(version 6.0.1).
- Consideration of leakage emissions due to the consumption of both grid-sourced electricity and LPG by
the project activity
- Consideration of the correct value for the ex-ante determined parameter CF (density of methane).
By taking into account the relative limitations of the methodological approach of AM0002 (version 1), the ex-ante
estimate of methane generation at the AMC landfill is performed by applying applicable approach of the
methodological tool “Emissions from solid waste disposal sites” (version 06.0.1). Such alternative approach
promotes more accurate and correct estimates of emission reductions (without affecting the amount of baseline
emissions to be determined ex-post as part of the application of the project’s monitoring plan + applicable GHG
calculations.
48 As outlined in the emission reduction calculation spreadsheet which is enclosed to the PDD, in the particular
context of ex-ante estimation of emission reduction to be achieved by the project activity, ER_CH4 CH4 y and flared,y are
calculated in mass basis (tCH ) in order to facilitated related calculations. BE is also estimated in mass 4 CH4,SWDS,y
basis (tCO e) as established by the methodological approach as per the methodological tool “Emissions from solid 2
waste disposal sites” (version 06.0.1).

 f in the methodological tool is assigned a value of 0 because y
the amount of LFG that would have been captured and
destroyed is already accounted.
 In the methodological tool, x begins with the year that MSW
started to be disposed in the AMC landfill.
 Sampling to determine the fractions of different waste types is
not necessary as waste composition can be obtained from
previous studies and no MSW disposal is prevented as a
result of the operation of the project.

Soil organic carbon
Estimations of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks were done in accordance to the “Tool for the estimation of
change in soil organic carbon stocks due to the implementation of A/R CDM project activity”. As suggested
by the tool, it is assumed that the implementation of the project activity increases the SOC content of the
lands from the pre-project level to the level that is equal to the steady-state SOC content under native
vegetation. The increase in SOC content in the project scenario takes place at a constant rate over a period
of 20 years from the year of planting. The project meets the applicability conditions of this tool in the area
managed with Pine plantations:
• the areas of land to which the tool is applied do not fall into wetland category, do not contain
organic soils and are not subject to any of the land management practices and application of
inputs listed in Tables 1 and 2 of the tool;
• Since the land use prior to project start was grassland, only Table 2 applies. For the
temperate warm moist climate region corresponding to the project activity, none of the three
combinations included in Table 2 are applicable;
• litter remains on site and is not removed and soil disturbance is in accordance with
appropriate conservation practices, limited to site preparation and not repeated within 20
years.
Table 19. Parameters used for estimation of SOC
SOC at the beginning of the project (SOC ) is estimated by multiplying the factors in Table 19 by the INITIAL,i
reference SOC. As per the tool, a loss in SOC (SOC ) is applied in the case that soil disturbance LOSS,i
occurs on more than 10 per cent of the land area, which is the case of Weyerhaeuser Uruguay project.
The following methodological formula is used for calculating the annual change in SOC stock:

5 Environmental Impact:
As described in section 1.7 of this Project Description, the land on which the Red
Hills Wind Farm is being constructed is rural agricultural farmland, which is best
suited for pasturing livestock and the cultivation of wheat and cotton crops.
Local development consists primarily of widely dispersed individual farmsteads.
Socioeconomic and environmental activity in the project area will remain
unchanged upon completion of the wind farm construction and operation. No
dislocation of people or wildlife will occur as a result of the project activity.
There are no federal authorizations or permits required for the project that would
entail consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, to include the
need to obtain project authorization from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. There
are four federally listed endangered or threatened species that potentially occur in
the general vicinity of the Red Hills Wind Project: the interior least tern, whooping
crane, piping plover, and the Arkansas River shiner. The project activity has been
designed to avoid impacts on the United States waterways.
Acciona Wind Energy USA LLC voluntarily contracted HDR Engineering, Inc.
(HDR) and Western Ecosystems Technology Inc. to complete the environmental
site assessment (ESA) and Biological Assessment of the property proposed for the
Red Hills Wind Project. The environmental assessment was completed by HDR on
January 30, 2008 and the biological assessment was completed by Western
Ecosystems on March 27, 2008.
Western Ecosystems determined that; “The Red Hills project avoids many of the
potential impacts to whooping cranes due to its distal proximity to the main
migratory flyway.” Western Ecosystems also determined that other aforementioned
endangered species were not threatened by the project activity.
Acciona voluntarily contracted Western Ecosystems to conduct a voluntary bat
assessment using acoustic monitoring equipment. Additionally post construction
bat mortality monitoring will take place for one year after operation of the facility
begins. Any bats that are found during these mortality studies will be offered as a
donation to the American Museum of Natural History for their ongoing Genomic
Studies.
Further studies such as the wetlands delineation was conducted on November 26
and 27, 2007, by two HDR biologists. The survey was conducted in accordance
with the Corps of Engineers Wetlands Delineation Manual (Environmental
Laboratory, 1987).
Acciona proposes to implement the following design, siting, and conservation
measures to ensure to that the ecological environment is not affected by the project
activity:
• Turbine Design: Acciona will use monopole, tubular designs that
eliminate avian perching sites. Guy wires will not be used on
turbines. If guy wires are used on the permanent and temporary
meteorological towers within the project, appropriate high visibility
markings will be used.
• Collector Line Design: Acciona will bury the majority (about 88%) of
the collector lines for the project. For the overhead collector line
41

Proprietary and Confidential
segments and the overhead 138 kV transmission line, Acciona will
mark the lines in accordance with methods recommended by the
Avian Power Line Committee (APLIC).
• Transmission Line: Using guidance from APLIC’s Suggested
Practices for Avian Protection on Power Lines, approximately 4 miles
of on-site overhead 138 kV transmission line will be designed to
minimize the potential for bird electrocutions.
• Lighting: The Red Hills Wind Project will use the minimum amount
of lighting as required by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
Lighting is anticipated to be pulsating red light on the minimum
number of turbines as required by the FAA in order to reduce the
disturbances on the local population.
• Air Impacts: Wind Power plants do not contribute to atmospheric
pollution as no fuel combustion is involved during any stage of the
operation. The primary emissions source for the project will be motor
vehicle exhaust resulting from construction and maintenance of the
project. However, in light of the project activity and the resulting
emission reductions, motor vehicle emissions will be a very minor
emissions source.
• Noise Impacts: Personal protective equipment is provided to workers
involved in construction activity to mitigate the effects of noise
pollution. Taking into consideration the project life cycle, the
magnitude of the impacts during the construction phase are negligible
and exists for a temporary period of time until the end of construction
phase. Therefore, noise pollution will also be a very minor issue and
will not harm the environment.
Acciona recognizes the concerns over the relationship between wind energy
development and the ecological environment of the project activity. As such,
commitments have been made to evaluate and immediately address issues that
impact the project activity area.

6 Stakeholders’ comments:
Stakeholders for the Red Hills Wind Farm project include landowners, local
residents, local officials, and Acciona staff.
Roger Mills County held public meetings on February 11th and June 16th 2008 to
discuss permitting issues for the Red Hills Wind Farm. During these meetings,
local constituents were provided the opportunity and platform to discuss their
concerns about the project activity.
Each meeting began with a brief progress update for the project activity by the
project developer, construction manager, and other project officials. The overall
reaction can be summarized as positive. The local residents expressed satisfaction
that the project activity has created local employment which is improving the
standard of life as well as socio-economic conditions of the surrounding area.
Moreover, local landowners have expressed satisfaction that the project activity has
led to an increase in land values.
Only one negative issue was raised by one non-participating landowner at the
February 11th meeting. This landowner raised concerns that the turbines were too
close to the fence surrounding his property, which is not in the project activity
area. This concern was investigated by the project developer and it was discovered
that the landowner had mistaken a property survey stake that was about 30 feet
from his fence for a turbine-staked location. This issue was resolved through
further communication with the landowner and was publicly addressed at the June
16th community meeting.
In July 2008, two non-participating landowners from Roger Mills County requested
to meet with the project developer to express concerns that the project activity was
located too close to their property lines. The landowners expressed that they felt
that permitting had occurred without their knowledge and felt that they had been
circumvented in the process. Over the course of a two-hour meeting, it was pointed
out that Acciona had followed the counties permitting guidance and that there were
two public meetings that they did not attend.
These landowners as well as all stakeholders involved in this project activity will be
notified of all future public meetings.

7 Schedule:
The Red Hills crediting period will begin on the commercial operation date of
October 26, 2008 and will last for 10 years thereafter. The lifespan of the wind
farm is expected to be 20 years after the operational date. The project activity will
not be terminated for any reason, other than for emergencies, until the end of the
operational life. Validation will be complete upon review and approval of this
document. Verification will occur depending on the needs of project participants.

The number of credits to be held in the permanence risk buffer (as per the VCS) is determined as a
percentage of the total carbon stock benefits. This is equal to the net emissions in the baseline minus
emissions from fossil fuel use and fertilizer use minus the net emissions in the project case minus
emissions from fossil fuels and fertilizer use. Leakage emissions do not factor into the buffer calculations.

5 Environmental Impact:
As per the prevailing local /host country laws no environmental impact assessment is
required, (the Schedule 1 of Ministry of Environment and Forests (Government of
India) notification dated September 14, 2006), 38 activities are required to undertake
environmental impact assessment studies. The details of these activities are available at
http://envfor.nic.in/legis/eia/so1533.pdf.
However the project participant has carried out Aspect and Impact analysis of all the
activities of the project and concluded that there is no negative environmental impact
due to the project activity and wind energy is one of the cleanest sources of energy.

Determination of
However, the bas𝑬𝑬e𝑬𝑬lin𝑩𝑩 e𝑩𝑩, 𝒄𝒄 emission factor for continuously flooded fields without organic
amendments ( ) can be determined ex ante prior to the start of the project activity, in
this case, the ex ante value should be used to calculate emission reduction during the 𝐵𝐵𝐸𝐸𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵,𝑐𝑐
crediting period. It should be measured by using closed chamber in three reference fields
which are chosen in the project area.
According to the guidance on methane measurement in the appendix of AMS-III.AU
Methodology, the following requirements should be met.
1. The implementation of methane measurement in rice fields requires the
involvement of experts in this field or at least experienced staff trained by experts
(i.e. from research institutions). These guidelines cannot replace expertise in
setting up chamber measurements. They rather set minimum requirements that
serve for standardizing the conditions under which methane emissions are
measured for projects under this methodology.
The closed chamber measurement requires the involvement of technicians trained by
experts from China National Rice Research Institute and the technical team from Search
Co2. China National Rice Research Institute (CRRI) is a national multi-disciplinary research
institute with rice as its main research object. The base is embedded just before
transplanting, and the first gas sampling began on the second day after transplanting,
followed by sampling every 7 days. After sampling, the gas is stored in the evacuated vial,
and the samples collected after three times should be taken together for laboratory
analysis.
34 For all scaling factor used in this methodology, the average values in 2006 IPCC Guidelines for
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories are chosen.

3 QUANTIFICATION OF GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND REMOVALS
3.1 Baseline Emissions
Baseline emissions are calculated as the carbon pools measured in the project area, which are
applied to the deforestation model. The amounts of emissions assigned for each selected carbon
pool depicted in the table in Section 2.3 are determined at the verification stage. It should be
noted that it is not mandatory to measure ex-ante carbon stocks in the project area according to
the applied methodology. The ex-ante estimates of the net carbon benefits of the project are only
required to determine whether decreases in carbon pools or increases in GHG emissions are
insignificant and need not be measured and monitored.
Table 16: Estimated baseline emissions for selected carbon pools over total project crediting period.
A spreadsheet with the complete GHG emission analysis for the entire project crediting period is
provided separately to the auditor68.
The sum of estimated emissions over selected carbon pools is calculated according to eq. 20 of
the methodology.
The following equations from the methodology will be used at the monitoring and verification
stage to calculate the baseline emissions:
• Baseline emissions in above ground large trees is calculated using eq. 21.
• Baseline emissions for above ground small trees is calculated using eq. 22.
• Baseline emissions in above ground non tree biomass is calculated using eq. 23.
• Baseline emissions in below ground large trees is calculated using eq. 24.
• Baseline emissions for below ground small trees is calculated using eq. 25.
• Baseline emissions in below ground non tree biomass is calculated using eq. 26.

3.2 Project Emissions
Project emissions for any monitoring period are estimated by the events of woody biomass
consumption.
Forest fires: The Project proponent understands that should significant forest fires occur during
the project crediting period, a map of the boundaries of the fire during the monitoring period will
be elaborated. The project area may need to be re-stratified based on the significance of fire
events.
Emissions from burning: No emissions from the burning of woody biomass as a result of project
activities in the project area occur.
The project emissions are calculated according to equation 31 of the methodology.

According to ACM0002 methodology (version 20), the emission reduction is calculated as
follows:
ER = BE Equation 3 y y
ER = Emission Reductions in year y (tCO e/year) y 2
BE = Baseline emissions in year y (tCO e/yr) y 2
As described in section 4.1, the quantification of the baseline scenario was done according
to version 20 of the ACM0002 methodology where only CO emissions from electricity 2
generation from fossil fuel fired power plants that are displaced due to the project activity
are included. The ex-ante baseline emissions were, therefore, calculated according to
Equation 1, described in section 4.1.
Operating Margin
The Operating Margin (OM) was calculated according to the “Tool to calculate the emission
factor for an electricity system.” The specific method chosen was the Simple OM Option A.
The OM is calculated ex ante using a three-year generation-weighted average, based on
the most recent data available at the time of PD submission. Based on the EIA data, this is
the years of 2019, 2018, and 2016, where the OM emission factor is calculated for each
year then averaged. Per application of Option A for computing the simple OM, the OM
calculation correctly included the LCMR<50% analysis to confirm the applicability of Option
A. No off-grid power plants were used in the computations. The OM was calculated as

power generation data is available. The BM EF is calculated ex-ante for the second 10-
year crediting period, based on the most recent year of data of built power plants from a
sample group m. The sample group is taken to be the power units with the larger power
generation of:
 The five power units, excluding those registered as VCS projects, that started to supply

There are additional steps in the case that one or more of the power units in the sample
group started to supply electricity to the grid more than 10 years ago, as detailed in the
CDM EF Tool. This is determined to not apply. Per CDM instructions, power plants
registered under VCS and/or other offset standards were excluded from sample group m.

Then, EF = (0.5862 (tCO /MWh) × 0.75) + (0.2060 (tCO /MWh) × .25) = 0.49114 grid,CM,y 2 2
Therefore, the Capricorn Ridge 4 combined margin is 0.49114 (tCO /MWh). 2
As described in section 4.1, the project emission reductions will be calculated according to
the ACM0002 methodology version 20. Therefore, the emission reductions calculation has
been simplified to the following equation:
ERy = BE – PE y y
Where:
ER = Emission Reduction in year y (t CO /yr) y 2
BE = 186,578 (t CO /yr) y 2
PE = 0 (tCO /yr) y 2
Then ER = 186,578 (tCO /yr) – 0 (tCO /yr) = 186,578 (tCO /yr) y 2 2 2
The emission reductions for each crediting year were calculated in the same manner using
the current combined margin and the electrical output of the project activity; updates to
these projections can be amended when the crediting period ends and the Project is filing
for renewal. Actual electricity consumption will be used to calculate emission deductions
from the Project.

Emission reduction (ER ): y
The project activity mainly reduces carbon dioxide through substitution of grid electricity
generation with fossil fuel fired power plant by renewable electricity. The emission reduction ER y
by the project activity during a given year y is the difference between Baseline emission and
Project emission & Leakage emission. The emission reduction is calculated in line with para 58 of
AC0002, Version 17, using equation below:
ER = BE -PE - LE y y y y
Where,
ER = Emission Reduction in tCO /year y 2

3.4 Summary of GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
Ex-ante calculation of emission reductions:
Simple Operating margin (OM)
As also explained above, for the computation of the Simple OM, the Ex-Ante option is selected, at the
time of PDD submission to the DOE, the data vintages that were most recent, belongs to the years
2008, 2009 and 2010. All the data used in calculation of the Simple OM are taken from the TEİAŞ
website, details of which are given below. Taking into account the available data “Simple OM” method
“Option B” is the appropriate method for the project activity. TEİAŞ publishes the annual heating
values of the fuels consumed in the power plants, the heating values are directly related to fuel
consumption and are used to calculate average Net Calorific Values (TJ/kt) (Table 10).
The heating values of fuels consumed in thermal power plants are announced by TEİAŞ, the unit of
the heating values are Tcal. Tcal is converted to GJoule by using the conversion factor 1cal = 4.1868
Joule. Then the heating values in GJ are divided by Fuel Consumption (FC ) to get the Net Calorific i,y
Values of the fuels consumed in TJ/kt as follows:

The emission factors of fuels required are taken from IPCC 2006 guidelines for GHG inventories33. All
data used for the calculations can be found in Annex-2 (See Table 1 and Table 2 to in Annex -2).

available data from the TEİAŞ website.
Table 11: Calculation of emission by electricity generation (2008-2010)
Net electricity generated and supplied to the grid by thermal power plants has been calculated using
data obtained from TEİAŞ web page. The ratio between total gross and total net generation (including
low-cost/must run plants) has been calculated for each year. The same ratio is assumed to be valid
for all thermal plants and total net generation by the plants has been calculated accordingly. Summing
up total net generation with the imported electricity, total supply excluding low cost / must run sources
for each year is determined and given in Table 12.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
The OM Emission Factor for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 are calculated by dividing the total CO 2
emissions for those years (Table10) to the Net Electricity Generation (Table 12) for the subject year.
The annual OM emission factors are calculated as follows (Table 13):
Table 13: Annual OM Emission Factors
2008 0.65959
2009 0.65195
2010 0.65670
Finally, OM emission factor is calculated as a generation weighted average for the three most recent
years. The resulting OM Emission Factor is;
EF = 0.65613 grid,OMsimple
Build margin (BM)
As mentioned above we have preferred the Option 1, calculating the Build Margin Emission factor, “ex
ante”, for the first crediting period.
Between the SET and SET , the sample group that comprises the larger annual generation is 5-units ≥20%
SET , hence the set of capacity additions in the electricity system that comprise 20% of the system ≥20%
generation is used.
The amount of electricity produced by the SET is calculated to be 4,288.65 GWh. (= AEG 5-units SET-5-
). units
The gross electricity generation in year 2010 is taken as reference for determination of plants that
comprise 20% of the system generation. The gross generation in year 2010 was 211,207.70 GWh
(Table 11) in 2010 out of this amount 7,053.40 GWh was identified34 to be produced by projects that
claimed VERs, excluding this number from the gross generation we end up with 195,992.70 GWh of
electricity which is our AEG and 20% of that amount is calculated as 39,198.54 GWh. TOTAL
Comparing the AEG and 20% of AEG , it is seen that 20% of AEG , is higher than SET-5-units TOTAL TOTAL
AEG SET-5-units.
Thereforethe 20% of AEG with a value of 39,198.54 GWh is to be compared to the capacity TOTAL
additions in the recent years.
Summing up electricity the generations of all the plants added to the Turkish National Grid in 2010
and 2009, but excluding the projects that claimed VERs, their total generation is 47,745.76 GWh.
The total generation by the power plants added in year 2010 is 26,256.04 GWh which is still less than
the 20% of AEG value of 39,198.54 GWh, however we are unable to identify the date of addition TOTAL

Capacity Projection report published by TEIAS (http://212.175.131.171/projeksiyon/KAPASITEPROJEKSIYONU2011.pdf). We

A.4.4.1. Estimated amount of emission reductions over the crediting period:
>>
According to the methodologies described in section B.2, the proposed project activity is expected to reduce 2.180
tonnes of CO equivalents per annum. This would result in a total reduction of 20.430 tonnes of CO equivalents 2 2
over the crediting period, as per the boundary definition given and thus not including e.g. reductions due to
renewable energy fed into the public grid system.
Figure 7 - Estimated Emission Reductions per year
The emission reductions of phase 2 with the addition of a further 300 or 500 kWel generation capacity and the use of
more waste co-ferments is not described in the below table.
The project operation is scheduled to commence in several stages with the fermenters only slowly being loaded to
full capacity. Due to this the omitted emissions in the first year of operation do not reach the design point, mostly
because the manure amount which can be handled by the plant in the initial phases is lower than the design mass
flow after full commissioning.

Estimating carbon stock in trees at a point of time
To estimate the carbon stock in tree biomass at a point of time, the following tool was used:
“Estimation of carbon stocks and change in carbon stocks of trees and shrubs in A/R CDM
project activities”, AR-TOOL14 (Version 04.1). According to Section 8.2 of this tool, this
method is used for ex-ante estimation (projection) of carbon stock in tree biomass.
Step 1: Tree biomass estimation
An equation for Eucalyptus uro-grandis derived from age has not been found. The equa-
tions available for this species depend on allometric parameters and there is not an avail-
able database with allometric parameters that allow us to adjust a time equation to estimate
the ex-ante carbon stocks.
Considering this, the annual increment in volume of wood suitable for industrial processing
value (I V) of 36.25 m³ha-1year-1 (trunk biomass volume) was used in combination with other
parameters derived from ANNEX 3A.1 “Biomass Default Tables for Section 3.2 Forest
Land” of IPCC Good Practice Guidance for LULUCF, to find the total biomass per hectare
(Table 17).

Step 9.0. Ex ante total net anthropogenic GHG emission reductions
Step 9.1. Significance assessment
Only the carbon stored in the above and below ground biomass pools were considered by the project.
While the above-ground pool is mandatory, the below-ground pool is optional but recommended by
the methodology, since it represents between 25% of the carbon stored in above-ground biomass and
is therefore a significant pool. Root-to-shoot ratios and data to estimate the carbon stocks in the
below-ground biomass pool were taken from IPCC GPG (2003).

Step 9.2. Calculation of ex-ante estimation of total net GHG emissions reductions
The ex-ante estimation of total net GHG emission reductions to be generated through the project
activity is calculated as follows:
∆REDDt = (∆CBSLPAt + EBBBSLPAt) – (∆CPSPAt + EBBPSPAt) – (∆CLKt + ELKt) .....equation 8
Where:
 ∆REDDt Ex ante estimated net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission reduction
attributable to the AUD project activity at year t; tCO -e ha-1 2
 ∆CBSLPAt Dum of baseline carbon stock changes in the project area at time t; tCO2-e
 EBBBSLPAt Sum of baseline emissions from biomass burning in the project area at time t;
tCO2-e;
 ∆CPSPAt Sum of ex ante estimated actual carbon stock changes in the project area at
time t; tCO2-e
 EBBPSPAt Sum of (ex ante estimated) actual emissions from biomass burning in the
project area at year t; tCO2-e
 ∆CLKt `Sum of ex ante estimated leakage net carbon changes at year t; tCO2-e
 ELKt Sum of ex ante estimated leakage emissions at year t; tCO2-e
Calculation of ex-ante Verified Carbon Units (Step 9.3 VM0015 v1.1)
The verified Carbon Units (VCTs) are calculated by subtracting the number of Buffer Credits (BCt)
deposited in the VCS Buffer at time t; t CO2-e from Ex ante estimated net anthropogenic greenhouse
gas emission reduction (∆REDDt ) attributable to the AUD project activity at year t; tCO2-e ha-1
(equation 9)
VCUt = ∆REDDt – VBCt ……….equation 9
Where:
VCUt Number of Verified Carbon Units that can be traded at time t; t CO2-e
∆REDDt Defined above
The Buffer for risk carbon unit are calculated by subtracting the total ex ante estimated actual
carbon stock changes in the project area at year t; tCO2-e ha-1 from the gross baseline carbon stock
changes in the project area at year t; tCO2e and multiplied by Risk factor (equation 10). Ex-ante
buffer credits are calculated based on a 15% risk factor estimated through the VCS non-permanence
risk tool.
VBCt = (∆CBSLPAt - ∆CPSPAt) * RFt ……….equation 10
Where:
∆CBSLPAt Sum of baseline carbon stock changes in the project area at year t; CO2-e
∆CPSPAt Sum of ex ante actual carbon stock changes in the project area at year t:

According to the applied methodology AMS-Ⅲ.AU (version 4.0), for the ex-ante estimation of
emission reductions within the project design document prior to the project implementation,
project proponent shall refer to own field experiments or estimate baseline and project
emissions with the help of national data or IPCC tier 1 default values for emission and scaling

Determination of EF BL, c
However, the baseline emission factor for continuously flooded fields without organic
amendments (EF ) can be determined ex-ante prior to the start of the project activity, in this BL, c
case, the ex-ante value should be used to calculate emission reduction during the crediting
period. It should be measured by using Closed Chamber in three reference fields which are
chosen in the project area.
According to the guidance on methane measurement in the appendix of AMS-III.AU Methodology,
the implementation of methane measurement in rice fields requires the involvement of experts
in this field or at least experienced staff trained by experts (i.e., from research institutions). These
guidelines cannot replace expertise in setting up chamber measurements. They rather set
minimum requirements that serve for standardizing the conditions under which methane
emissions are measured for projects under this methodology.
1) The Closed Chamber measurement requires the cooperation of the experts from Huazhong
Agricultural University and the staff of the Agricultural Bureau of Qianxi City and Agricultural
Bureau of Jinsha County. Huazhong Agricultural University is an institution of higher learning
of agriculture in China. The experts set up the chamber measurements on 10-April-2017. The
base is embedded just before transplanting, and the first gas sampling began on the second
day after transplanting, followed by sampling every 7 days. After sampling, as is stored in the
evacuated vial, and the samples collected after three times should be taken together for
laboratory analysis.
2) Project proponent shall prepare a detailed plan for the seasonal methane measurements
before the start of the season. The plan shall include the schedule for the field and laboratory
measurements, the logistics that are necessary to get the gas samples to the laboratory and
a cropping calendar. The plan shall also include all reference field specific information
14 For all scaling factor used in this methodology, the average values in 2006 IPCC Guidelines for
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories are chosen.

Uncertainty Factor Calculation
VM0012 utilized an Uncertainty Factor calculation to account for additional ‘over-riding
confidence deduction as a proxy for collective project uncertainty by assessing statistical
uncertainty in the forest carbon inventory and associated modeling.
The methodology monitoring section specifies that all analysis units will have representation
by one or more field plots. However, due to the difficulty of determining the independence
of plot data within individual homogeneous polygons (i.e. a specifically similar forest type,
site, and age), it will be necessary to only calculate a single carbon density observation for
each individual polygon sampled; either through the use of a single plot within that polygon,
or calculation of the mean of multiple plots within that polygon. Throughout these
calculations a plot observation, subscript i, is defined to represent the mean of all plots
within a given polygon.
The project-level uncertainty factor is calculated as follows:
Step 1 – Calculate the average percent model error (E ) for the project based on the M
average area-weighted difference between measured values in monitored plot observations
and model-predicted values using Equations 60a,b. In the case where analysis units have
been used for stratification, the difference between the plot observation and model-
predicted value (both expressed on a per hectare basis) for a given analysis unit (y ) is d,h,i
weighted by the area of its associated analysis unit (A , )(Eq. 60a). The use of an area- PRJ h
weighting factor places more emphasis on analysis units that represent a relatively larger
proportion of the total project area.
E = 100 • (∑ y / ∑(A , • y )) (60a) M d,h,i PRJ h m,h,i
Where,

A = area of project analysis unit, h (ha) PRJ,h
Step 2 – Calculate the inventory error (E) at a 90 percent confidence interval expressed as I
a percentage of the mean area-weighted inventory estimate from the measured plots.
This methodology was designed to accommodate complex landscapes consisting of
hundreds to thousands of polygons, which can be further grouped into analysis units.
Inventory error is estimated based upon the difference between modeled and measured
values for monitoring plots established in polygons or in polygons grouped within analysis
units.
Inventory error, E, is estimated by first calculating the standard error of the area-weighted I
differences between the plot observation measurement and the associated model-predicted
carbon storage (both on a per hectare basis) for analysis units or polygons. The standard
error is then multiplied by the t-value for the 90 percent confidence interval. Finally E is I
expressed in relative terms (in Equation 60c) by dividing the 90% confidence interval of the
area-weighted differences between predicted and measured values in all plots by the area-
weighted average of the measured values in all monitoring plots.

E = Inventory error for the project (%) I

plot observation and predicted values of carbon storage.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
Based on the above mentioned parameters and calculations, the calculated baseline emissions
are as follows:
Project Emissions (PEy)
As mentioned earlier in section B.6.1, project emissions due to project activity are considered to
be zero. Therefore
PEy= 0
Leakage Emissions (LEy)
As mentioned earlier in section B.6.1, leakage emissions due to proposed project activity are
considered as zero. Therefore
LEy = 0
Emission Reductions (ERy)
ERy= BEy-PEy-LEy
ERy = 23072-0-0
ERy = 23072
Thus, the annual emission reductions from the proposed project activity have been estimated as
23072 tCO2e.
The estimated baseline emissions, project emission, leakage emissions and net emission
reductions are mentioned in table below:

a) Technical description of the monitoring tasks.
The calculation of ex post net anthropogenic GHG emission reductions is similar to the ex-ante
calculation with the only difference that ex post estimated carbon stock changes and GHG
emissions must be used in the case of the project scenario and leakage.
b) Data to be collected.
Report the ex post estimated net anthropogenic GHG emissions and calculation of Verified
Carbon Units (VCUt, and VBCt) using the same table format used for the ex-ante assessment:
- Ex post estimated net anthropogenic GHG emission reductions and VCUs.
c) Overview of data collection procedures.
Data collection procedures are the same as described in previous steps. This step involves
compilation of data from previous procedures to calculate ex post net anthropogenic GHG
emission reduction.
d) Quality control and quality assurance procedures.
A map showing Cumulative Areas Credited within the project area shall be updated and presented
to VCS verifiers at each verification event. The cumulative area cannot generate additional VCUs
in future periods.
e) Data archiving.
All maps and records generated during project implementation will be conserved and made
available to VCS verifiers at verification for inspection to demonstrate that the AUD project activity
has actually been implemented.
All documents and records will be kept in a secure retrievable manner for at least two years after

According to the methodology, the emissions considered occur in two ways:
• Through the burning of fossil fuel during the establishment practices, forest management and
explotation
• Burning of biomass or wood

This component considers all plant material of the herbaceous and shrub-like type which is eliminated during
the establishment stages of the forest plantations: For the project conditions, the elimination of some coffee
shrubs in order to incorporate the forest system is estimated. The steps to be followed in the quantification of
emissions according to the methodology are:
Step 1: Estimate the amount of biomass removed. Said estimate is made in systems with existing non-woody
or shrub-like vegetation and for the pasture lands the maximum stock present is considered, in order to be
conservative. For coffee plantations it is carried out by counting the coffee trees eliminated per tree unit of
the tree stand model incorporated. The number of coffee trees removed is variable, given that their planting
density in the region ranges from 6,000 to 10,000 trees/ha. The biomass estimate per individual unit is carried
out through equations generated for the region are based on existing equations from the scientific literature
with data from the area51.
Step 2: Estimate the average biomass proportion harvested (with the information and procedures of step 1)
and apply the respective GHG emission factor. The emission factors established in Tables 3.A 15 and 3.A.16
of the IPCC GPG-LULUCF will be used.
Step 3: Estimating of GHG emissions resulted from the slash and burn based on revised IPCC 1996
Guideline for LULUCF and IPCC GPG-LULUCF (eq. 102, 103, 104 and 105 of methodology):

According to equation prescribed in ACM0002 (version 17), the Emission Reduction is calculated
by subtracting the project emissions from the baseline emissions.
Thus ER = BE – PE – LE y y y y
As described under section 3.2 and 3.3, the Project emission and Leakage emissions are zero for
the project activity, therefore,
ER = (BE – 0 – 0) = BE y y y

activity
The project was implemented by manual operation, rather than mechanical operation. Besides,
no weeding, chopping, pruning, intermediate cutting activities are going to be conducted during
thecrediting period because of the natural condition, the economiccondition andthe slow growth
pattern. The project is implemented on non-forest land as mentions above, there is no grazing /
farming activity existed before the project activity. Fertilization and watering are not going to take
place, neither. Therefore, there is no expected leakage due to the displacement of agricultural
activityfromtheprojectactivity.
Therefore, there is no expected leakage due to decrease in carbon stock in the carbon pools of
the land and change in soil organic carbon stock. There is no expected leakage due to the pre-
projectagriculturalactivities(grazing,farming)willnotdisplacefromtheprojectactivity.
Therefore,leakageiszerofortheproposedproject.

For project pre-estimation, because it is usually impossible to predict the occurrence of fires
within the project boundary, the greenhouse gas emissions within the project boundary
caused by forest fires are not considered, that is, the greenhouse gas emissions are 0.
Therefore, only the changes of biomass carbon storage within the project boundary are
considered. From the previous calculation on baseline emissions and leakage emissions, we
learn that estimated baseline emissions is 0 tCO -e for the project, and estimated leakage 2
emissionsis0 tCO -e for the project. 2
The net anthropogenic GHG removalsby the project are summarized below.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
Estimation of carbon stock in living biomass of trees at the stratum level
1. The carbon stock in living biomass30of trees for stratum i (C )is estimated using the following trees,i,t
approach:
The mean carbon stock in above-ground biomass per unit area is estimated based on field
measurements in permanent sample plots by using the BEF method.
Method based on BEF
Step 1: Determine based on available data, e.g., volume tables (ex ante) and measurements (ex post),
the diameter at breast height (DBH, at typically 1.3 m above-ground level), and also preferably height (H),
of all the trees above some minimum DBH (in this case > 10cm) in the permanent sample plots.
.Step 2: Estimate the volume of the commercial (merchantable) timber component of trees-based on
available equations or yield tables (if locally derived equations or yield tables are not available use
relevant regional, national or default data as appropriate). It is possible to combine Steps 1 and 2 if field
instruments (e.g., a relascope) that measure the volume of each tree directly are applied.
.
Step 3: Choose appropriate values for BEF.
Step 4: Convert the volume of the commercial timber component of trees into carbon stock in
aboveground biomass via basic wood density D, the BEF and the carbon fraction using Eq. 5. See
Section VII for guidance on source of data for wood density.
Step 5: Convert the carbon stock in above-ground biomass to the carbon stock in below-ground biomass
via root-shoot ratio, given by:

}","4.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
Net GHG emission reductions and removals in year t of the project are quantified according to
equation 59 in Section 8.4 of VM0026. The project’s contribution to the AFOLU pooled buffer
account is then calculated from annual project removals due to changes in soil carbon in
proportion to the non-permanence risk rating determined using the VCS AFOLU Non-Permanence
Risk Tool (equations 61/62). This buffer contribution is then subtracted from net GHG emissions
reductions and removals eligible to calculate the project’s final issuance of verified carbon units
(VCUs, VM0026 equation 60). These calculations can be found in the ‘Ex Ante Emissions and
Removals’ tab of the workbook ‘MIG Validation Emissions and Removals Calculations.xlsx’ and
they are also summarized in Table 10.

Correction for large maximum allowable relative error.
The maximum allowable relative error of the mean tree biomass is calculated using the following
equation:
RE u Equation (15)
max bTREE,t
Where:
REmax = Maximum relative error, %
U = Uncertainty of the mean tree carbon per hectare within the project boundary at bTREE,t
time t; %.
T = 1, 2, 3 … years counted from the start of the A/R CDM project activity
The PP demonstrates that the relative error is 1.18%, therefore, since this value is less than 10%,
the deduction rate is 0%.

demonstrated above in Section 2.5, the baseline scenario is the one involving
limited encroachment maintenance at a steady state. This baseline scenario
represents the carbon stocks in living trees at the start of the project activity

VCS Project Description Template
For this ARR project activity, Face in 1999 commissioned Meijer to carry out a
baseline study whose results show that changes in the carbon stocks for both
above and below ground biomass are expected not to exceed actual net GHG
removals by sinks and are therefore assumed to be zero in the absence of the
project activity. Hence the formula above is only applied to multiply the 5.2 tonnes
of carbon per hectare (adjusted from Meijer, 1999), which is the conservative
value of the carbon stock in the stratum ‘banana plantation’, with the combined
area A of stratum ‘Planted Area’ and ‘Regenerating Area’. The total area to be i
planted during the crediting period is presented in Table 7.2 and has a size of
6,000 hectares. In addition, the Regenerating Area is 2,593 hectares. The
combined area is therefore 8,593 hectares. As the baseline is in a steady state,
there is no increases in GHG removals. See Annex III for details on the estimation,
and the spreadsheet ´ Kibale Baseline Recalculation_082711 ´, which details the
calculation of the mean tree carbon stock in the baseline, based on inventory data
by Meijer in 1999. In addition, the carbon stock changes in dead wood, litter and
soil organic matter are conservatively assumed to be zero based on the
methodology applied.

(3) Determination of EF BL, c
However, the baseline emission factor for continuously flooded fields without organic
amendments (EF ) can be determined ex-ante prior to the start of the project activity, in this BL, c
case, the ex-ante value should be used to calculate emission reduction during the crediting
period. It should be measured by using Closed Chamber in three reference fields which are
chosen in the project area.
According to the guidance on methane measurement in the appendix of AMS-III.AU Methodology,
the implementation of methane measurement in rice fields requires the involvement of experts
in this field or at least experienced staff trained by experts (i.e., from research institutions).
These guidelines cannot replace expertise in setting up chamber measurements. They rather set
minimum requirements that serve for standardizing the conditions under which methane
emissions are measured for projects under this methodology.
11 In the methodology, “season” means an entire cropping season from land preparation until harvest or post season drainage.
12 For all scaling factor used in this methodology, the average values in 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories
are chosen.

Based on paragraph 43 of methodology AMS.I.D (version 18.0) and paragraph 61 of
methodology ACM0002 (version 16.0) and AMS.I.F (Version 03), net GHG emission reductions
are calculated as follows:
ERy = BEy – PEy - LE y
ERy = Emission reductions in year y (tCO2e/yr)
BEy = Baseline emissions in year y (tCO2e/yr)
PEy = Project emissions in year y (tCO2e/yr).

3.4 Estimated Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
As per methodology ACM0002 (version 17.0) and AMS I.D version 18, net GHG emission
reductions are calculated as follows:
ERy = BEy – PEy
ERy = Emission reductions in year y (tCO2e/yr)
BEy = Baseline emissions in year y (tCO2e/yr)
PEy = Project emissions in year y (tCO2e/yr)
Ex-ante calculation (estimate) of net GHG emission reductions:
Ex-ante emission reduction calculations are calculated based on current project activity instances
to be included in the grouped project activity under consideration. Summary of ex-ante emission
reduction calculations is as follows:

A.4.4 Estimated amount of emission reductions over the chosen crediting period:
>>
Based on an expected lifetime of the project equipment of 20 years, a 7 year renewable crediting period is
chosen. The first crediting period is designed to start on October 1st 2009 (or the date of registration, of
which the later date will be chosen as starting date of the crediting period) and will end on September30th
of 2016.
