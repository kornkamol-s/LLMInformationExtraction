Under Kubiak, the Broncos planned to install a run-oriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Manning's shotgun passing skills, but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line, as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998, due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer, and the simple fact that Manning was getting old, as he turned 39 in the 2015 off-season. Although the team had a 7\u20130 start, Manning led the NFL in interceptions. In week 10, Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot. He set the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards in this game, but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler, who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season. Osweiler was injured, however, leading to Manning's return during the Week 17 regular season finale, where the Broncos were losing 13\u20137 against the 4\u201311 San Diego Chargers, resulting in Manning re-claiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27\u201320 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed.

Maintenance: Emptying the lakes allows for maintenance activities such as cleaning and removing accumulated debris, plants, and sediments. This helps to maintain the overall health and cleanliness of the lake ecosystem.\n\n2. Preventing freezing damage: By emptying the lakes, park authorities can prevent potential damage caused by freezing temperatures. When water freezes, it expands, which can lead to cracks in the lake bed or surrounding structures. Emptying the lakes minimizes the risk of such damage.\n\n3. Controlling invasive species: Some lakes may be prone to invasive plant species that can harm the native flora and fauna. Emptying the lakes can disrupt the life cycle of these invasive species and help prevent their spread.\n\n4. Aesthetic reasons: Parks are often visited for their beauty and tranquility. Emptying the lakes allows for a fresh start in the spring, providing park visitors with a visually appealing and clean environment.\n\nIt is worth noting that not all small lakes in parks are emptied before winter. The decision to empty a lake depends on various factors, including the lake's size, location, ecological considerations, and park management policies."}

{"input":"Question: What city served as Poland's capital in 1313?\n\nContext: The first historical reference to Warsaw dates back to the year 1313, at a time when Krak\u00f3w served as the Polish capital city. Due to its central location between the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth's capitals of Krak\u00f3w and Vilnius, Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland when King Sigismund III Vasa moved his court from Krak\u00f3w to Warsaw in 1596. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Warsaw was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars, the city became the official capital of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, a puppet state of the First French Empire established by Napoleon Bonaparte. In accordance with the decisions of the Congress of Vienna, the Russian Empire annexed Warsaw in 1815 and it became part of the \"Congress Kingdom\". Only in 1918 did it regain independence from the foreign rule and emerge as a new capital of the independent Republic of Poland. The German invasion in 1939, the massacre of the Jewish population and deportations to concentration camps led to the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943 and to the major and devastating Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944. Warsaw gained the title of the \"Phoenix City\" because it has survived many wars, conflicts and invasions throughout its long history. Most notably, the city required painstaking rebuilding after the extensive damage it suffered in World War II, which destroyed 85% of its buildings. On 9 November 1940, the city was awarded Poland's highest military decoration for heroism, the Virtuti Militari, during the Siege of Warsaw (1939).","output":"['Krak\u00f3w', 'Krak\u00f3w', 'Krak\u00f3w']","answer":"The city that served as Poland's capital in 1313 was Krak\u00f3w."}

Desire for Polish self-determination: The Polish government-in-exile wanted to establish a legitimate Polish authority in Warsaw before the Soviet-backed Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN) could establish its control. The government-in-exile feared that the PKWN would be a puppet government under Soviet influence and did not want to lose their chance to establish an independent Poland.\n\n2. Political motivations: The Polish government-in-exile sought to demonstrate its legitimacy and assert its authority over the Polish population. By leading an armed uprising against the German occupiers, they aimed to show the Polish people and the international community that they were the legitimate representatives of Poland.\n\n3. Concerns about Soviet intentions: The Polish government-in-exile was aware of Stalin's hostility towards the idea of an independent Poland. They feared that the Red Army would not only liberate Poland from German occupation but also impose Soviet control over the country. By taking control of Warsaw before the arrival of the Red Army, they hoped to establish a Polish authority that could negotiate with the Soviets from a position of strength.\n\n4. Symbolic importance: Warsaw, as the capital of Poland, held significant symbolic value. The government-in-exile wanted to demonstrate their commitment to the Polish people by leading a major uprising in the heart of the country.\n\nHowever, the Warsaw Uprising did not achieve its intended goals and resulted in significant loss of life and destruction. The reasons for its failure are complex and involve factors such as the German military response, lack of support from the Western Allies, and the Soviet Union's decision to halt their advance on Warsaw."}

{"input":"Question: What is the basic unit of territorial division in Poland?\n\nContext: The basic unit of territorial division in Poland is a commune (gmina).

The new Norman rulers were culturally and ethnically distinct from the old French aristocracy, most of whom traced their lineage to Franks of the Carolingian dynasty. Most Norman knights remained poor and land-hungry, and by 1066 Normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation.

Under this state, there was great religious freedom, and alongside the Norman nobles existed a meritocratic bureaucracy of Jews, Muslims and Christians, both Catholic and Eastern Orthodox. The Kingdom of Sicily thus became characterized by Norman, Byzantine Greek, Arab, Lombard and \"native\" Sicilian populations living in harmony, and its Norman rulers fostered plans of establishing an Empire that would have encompassed Fatimid Egypt as well as the Crusader states in the Levant.

Efficiency: AC electricity allowed for more efficient transmission of power over long distances compared to DC electricity. AC could be easily converted to high voltages using transformers, which reduced power loss during transmission. This made AC a more cost-effective option for powering cities and industries.\n\n2. Safety: AC electricity is less dangerous than DC electricity at high voltages. In AC systems, the voltage periodically reverses direction, which means that the current periodically crosses zero, reducing the risk of electrical shock. This made AC a safer choice for widespread distribution and use.\n\n3. Scalability: AC systems allowed for the efficient generation and distribution of electricity on a large scale. The use of polyphase current in AC systems, as developed by Tesla, allowed for the generation of a rotating magnetic field, which simplified the design of motors and generators. This made it easier to build and operate power plants and machinery that required high-power outputs.\n\n4. Lower maintenance: AC motors, like Tesla's induction motor, did not require a commutator, which eliminated the need for mechanical brushes. This greatly reduced maintenance requirements and increased the reliability of AC motors compared to DC motors, which required regular maintenance and brush replacement.\n\nOverall, the efficiency, safety, scalability, and lower maintenance requirements of AC electricity made it increasingly popular and led to its widespread adoption for power generation and distribution."}

Market Potential: Westinghouse recognized that Tesla's AC motor and related power system had significant market potential. Tesla's design was considered viable and had the potential to revolutionize electrical power transmission. Westinghouse likely believed that Tesla's patent would control the market and provide a competitive advantage.\n\n3. Cost and Effort: Applying for a patent involves significant costs and effort, including legal fees and the patent application process itself. Westinghouse may have determined that pursuing a similar patent for a motor already being developed by Tesla and potentially facing legal challenges was not worth the investment.\n\n4. Strategic Decision: It is possible that Westinghouse made a strategic decision to focus on other areas of electrical technology where they could gain a competitive advantage rather than pursuing a patent for a motor that Tesla had already demonstrated.\n\nIt's important to note that the reasons behind Westinghouse's decision are not explicitly stated in the provided context, so these are speculative explanations based on general considerations."}

{"input":"Question: What caused the delay during the development of the AC motor.\n\nContext: Tesla's demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, put Tesla firmly on the \"AC\" side of the so-called \"War of Currents,\" an electrical distribution battle being waged between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse that had been simmering since Westinghouse's first AC system in 1886 and had reached the point of all-out warfare by 1888. This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and Westinghouse using his own patented AC system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent. The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system, but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Tesla's motor had to be put on hold for a while.

{"input":"Question: What does a Turing machine handle on a strip of tape?\n\nContext: A Turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine. It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a thought experiment representing a computing machine\u2014anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the Church\u2013Turing thesis. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a RAM machine, Conway's Game of Life, cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.","output":"['symbols', 'symbols', 'symbols']","answer":"A Turing machine handles symbols on a strip of tape.

{"input":"Question: If NP is not equal to P, viewed through this lens, what type of problems can also be considered intractable?\n\nContext: Problems that can be solved in theory (e.g., given large but finite time), but which in practice take too long for their solutions to be useful, are known as intractable problems. In complexity theory, problems that lack polynomial-time solutions are considered to be intractable for more than the smallest inputs. In fact, the Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis states that only those problems that can be solved in polynomial time can be feasibly computed on some computational device. Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are EXPTIME-hard. If NP is not the same as P, then the NP-complete problems are also intractable in this sense. To see why exponential-time algorithms might be unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting. For small n, say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 1012 operations each second, the program would run for about 4 \u00d7 1010 years, which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress. Nevertheless, a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical. If its running time is, say, n15, it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances.","output":"['NP-complete problems', 'NP-complete', 'NP-complete', 'NP-complete']","answer":"In addition to NP-complete problems, there are other types of problems that can be considered intractable if NP is not equal to P.

PSPACE-complete problems: These are problems that are complete for the complexity class PSPACE, which includes all problems that can be solved using a polynomial amount of memory. If NP is not equal to P, then PSPACE-complete problems would also be considered intractable.\n\n3. Bounded-depth search problems: These are problems that can be solved using a polynomial amount of time, but only if the search depth is limited to a constant value. If the search depth is allowed to grow with the size of the input, the problem becomes intractable.\n\nIt's important to note that the intractability of a problem can depend on various factors such as the specific algorithm used, the available computational resources, and the desired level of efficiency.

Stigma and societal expectations: The teaching profession has traditionally been seen as a predominantly female profession. Men who choose to become teachers may face stereotypes or societal expectations that associate teaching with femininity, which can deter some men from pursuing this career.\n\n2. Fear of false accusations: In recent years, there have been high-profile cases of teachers engaging in inappropriate relationships with students. The fear of being falsely accused of misconduct can discourage some men from pursuing a career in teaching, as they may worry about the potential damage to their personal and professional reputation.\n\n3. Negative media portrayal: Media coverage often focuses on cases of male teachers involved in sexual misconduct, which can contribute to the perception that men in teaching are a potential risk. This negative portrayal may dissuade some men from considering teaching as a career option.\n\n4. Lack of male role models: The shortage of male teachers can perpetuate the idea that teaching is not a suitable career choice for men. Without sufficient male role models in the profession, young boys may not see teaching as a viable career option, further exacerbating the shortage of male teachers.\n\nIt's important to note that these reasons may vary by individual and cultural context.
