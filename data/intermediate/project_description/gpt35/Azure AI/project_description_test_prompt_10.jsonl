Instead, the project will achieve\nGHG emission reductions and removals, maintain soil fertility and benefit local cropland\necosystem.\nLikewise, the project is not expected to result in any harm in the socio-economic aspect, either.\nThe project provides local population with opportunities to learn and adopt conservation\nagriculture, promotes sustainable crop production, and ensures corn yield and hence farmers\u2019\nrevenues, especially during years of extreme weather events. VCU sales revenues shared with\nfarmers will also improve their household income and life quality.\n2.2 Local Stakeholder Consultation\nIn early 2021, the project proponent spent several months visiting villages in Zhenlai County\nand had initial contact with farming households to get themselves informed of the agricultural\npractices adopted as well as farmers\u2019 general opinions about conservation agriculture. In the\nmeantime, the project proponent also established contact with Bureau of Agriculture and Rural\nAffairs of Zhenlai County to have a \u201cbig picture\u201d on conditions of local agriculture development.\nIn general, local farmers expressed hesitancy, doubt or reluctance towards the adoption of\nconservation agriculture. They were doubtful about effectiveness of conservation practices in\nassuring crop yield and maintaining soil fertility; they were reluctant to spend money on\nmachineries required to undertake the project activity; most importantly, there was a general\nlack of knowledge and skills among local population to allow them to properly adopt\nconservation practices.\nAfter learning about local conditions, the project proponent decided that they would pay for\nmachineries if required by farmers and provide training sessions to them to build their capacity\nin conservation practices.\nOn various dates in July and August 2021, the project proponent organized theme meetings at\neach of the villages involved, invited local farmers as well as representatives from Bureau of\nAgriculture and Rural Affairs of Zhenlai County.\nOn each of the meetings, the project proponent explained the concept and principle of\nconservation agriculture; they ensured that they would provide technical guidance to farmers\nduring the entire cropping season. The project proponent further asked the attendees about\ntheir doubts or worries in implementing the project activity and explained measures accordingly.\nIn addition, they also gave a brief introduction of the VCS program and its project development\nprocess.\n15","output":"{'project_name': 'Jilin Zhenlai Improved Agricultural Land Management Project', 'project_summary': 'Jilin Zhenlai Improved Agricultural Land Management Project (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe project\u201d) implements conservation agriculture (crop residue addition and no or reduced tillage) in 60,000 hectares (or 900,000 Mu  ) of monocropping corn fields located in villages under the administration of Zhenlai County, Baicheng City, Jilin Province, China.\\r\\nThe project is expected to replace conventional farming practices and promote conservation agriculture, which entails incorporating crop residues in the field after the harvest and applying no or reduced tillage prior to sowing.

The sewage will be treated to meet the national standard.\n4. Main Ecological Impacts\nThe project site had only some drought-resistant grasses. There are no rare plants. The wind farm\ncovers an area of mainly grassland, therefore, the project's overall impact on the local vegetation is\nnot significant. According to the survey, this area has no large wild animals, mammals, mainly\nrabbits, rats and other small animals, and therefore, the impact on wildlife during the construction\nperiod will be minor.\nD.2.

Combining sustainable development with carbon\nsequestration, TIST supports the reforestation and biodiversity efforts of about 87,000\nsubsistence farmers. Carbon credit sales generate participant income and provide project\nfunding to address agricultural, HIV\/AIDS, nutritional and fuel challenges. As TIST expands to\nmore groups and more areas, it ensures more trees, more biodiversity, more climate change\nbenefit and more income for more people.\nSince its inception in 1999, TIST participants organized into over 12,000 TIST Small Groups have\nplanted over 18 million trees on their own and community lands. GhG sequestration is creating a\nlong-term income stream and developing sustainable environments and livelihoods. TIST in\nUganda began in 2003 and has grown to about 14,500 TIST participants in about 2,200 Small\nGroups.\nUG PD-VCS-002 is a small scale AFOLU project, eligible under the Afforestation, Reforestation\nand Revegetation (ARR) category. It is a subset of the TIST project in Uganda and initially\napplied to 17 of the Small Groups, 94 members, 22 project areas and 169 ha. The PD was\nvalidated and first verified on 20 March 2012 by Environmental Services, Inc. (ESI).\nUG-VCS-002 was verified a second time 27 October 2014 by JACO CDM.

{"input":"Question: What is the project sector, either Renewable Energy or Forestry and Land Use?\n\nContext: \n\n1 PROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nThe project changing from continuously flooded to intermittently flooded conditions during rice\ncultivation is conducted in Tonghe County, Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province, China, with a total\nacreage of 17,621 ha of single-cropping rice. Without the project, there would be no ditches,\npumps, valves, and reservoirs to conduct the intermittently flooded method, the traditional\ncontinuously flooded method would be continued. The original scenario in which rice was\ncultivated by the continuously flooded method is the baseline scenario. Due to the anaerobic\ndecomposition of organic matter in the paddy soil under flooded conditions, a large amount of\nmethane can be released, so the intermittently flooded method is more conducive to saving water,\nimproving rice yield and reducing methane emissions than the continuously flooded method.\nThe implementation activities of the project include cement ditch construction, reservoir\nconstruction, pumps and valves installation, training, etc. According to the needs of rice growth,\nfarmers use pumps and valves to control irrigation and drainage, which not only saves water\nresources but also reduces methane emissions from soil organic matter under anaerobic\nconditions. Through the pumps and valves, the necessary water can be supplied to the rice\npaddies in time in the dry season, and the excess water can be drained from the rice paddies in\nthe rainy season. In this case, the methane emission can be declined by an average of 48%.\nHence, with the proposed project activity, the estimated GHG reduction from rice is 3.33\ntCO e\/ha. 2\nThe project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions by 410,298 tCO e in the first seven-year 2\nperiod, with an average annual GHG emission reduction of 58,614 tCO e.

The Solar water heater works on the principle of absorption of solar\nradiation by black body. Solar energy is received on earth surface in form of radiation\ncomprises mostly of the visible and infrared wavelength. The black body intercepting the\nsolar radiation converts solar energy into heat which is transferred to the fluid. The\ncollector are insulated at the bottom and exposed to solar radiation. As the black surface\nabsorbs radiation in the complete wave length region of the solar spectrum, it gains heat\nand starts loosing heat to the surrounding. To prevent the heat loss the collector is\nenclosed within a glass enclosure that provides a greenhouse effect. Glass allows\ntransmitting most of the visible part of the radiation and part of the near infra-red radiation\nhowever it is opaque to infrared wavelength range in which the hot plates emit radiation.\nThe heat absorbed by the solar collector is transferred to the water flowing through it.\nHeated water is collected in the tank which is insulated to prevent heat loss. Circulation of\nthe water from the tank through the collector and back to the tank continues automatically\ndue to the density difference between the hot and cold water by thermo syphon effect.\nEligibility Criteria\nNot applicable to this project activity as this is not a grouped project.\n1.5 Project Proponent\n1.6 Other Entities Involved in the Project\n6","output":"{'organization_name': 'G K Energy Marketers Pvt.

The average annual power\ndelivered to the grid by the project is expected to be 101,689 MWh.\nThe baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of the\nimplementation of the project activity: electricity delivered to the Grid by the project\nwould have otherwise been generated by the operation of grid-connected power\nplants and by the addition of new generation sources. The Project can reduce GHG\nemissions by replacing the electricity generated by fossil fuel fired power plants North\nChina Power Grid (NCPG).

In some\ninstances where the Ejidos have subdivided the rights associated with a certain domain or piece of land\nto a subset of the community, the consent of that subset of the community is required. All Ejidos are\nprotected by Mexico\u2019s La Ley Agraria (The Agrarian Law) and are recorded in the Registro Agrario\nNacional2 in Mexico City.\nIn addition to Ejidos, there are also direct private ownerships of land by individuals or organizations, who\nhave land records to substantiate their claims to the land, and these are recorded in the Public Property\nRegistry of each state in Mexico3.\nCredit Ownership\nThe individuals or entities enrolling their lands irrevocably assign the right, title and interest to the\nGreenhouse Gas Reductions and Removals thus generated on their lands during the project to\nConserWater Technologies Inc (doing business as Boomitra). The individuals or entities enrolling their\nlands disclaim all right, title and interest to any Carbon Credits that may arise from the Land.
