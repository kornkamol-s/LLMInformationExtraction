PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
3.2 Project Emissions
The project activity involves harnessing of wind energy and its conversion to electricity. Hence,
according to the methodology ACM0002, Version 17.0, there will be no project emissions, i.e. PE y
= 0.
3.3 Leakage
As per the methodology ACM0002, Version 17.0, no leakage has been considered, therefore,
LEy = 0.
3.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
Ex-ante calculation of emission reductions is equal to ex-ante calculation of baseline emissions
as project emissions and leakage are nil.
BE = EG * EF y PJ, y grid, CM, y
Where:
BE = Baseline emissions in year y (tCO /yr) y 2
EG = Quantity of net electricity generation that is produced and fed into the grid as a PJ,y
result of the implementation of the CDM project activity in year y (MWh/yr)
EF = Combined margin CO emission factor for grid connected power generation in grid,CM,y 2
year y calculated using the latest version of the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for
an electricity system” (tCO /MWh) 2
Baseline emission factor (Combined Margin) (EF ) = 0.9777tCO e/MWh grid, CM, y 2
Since, the project activity is the installation of a new grid - connected renewable power plant,
EG = EG PJ,y facility,y
EG = Quantity of net electricity generation supplied by the project plant/unit to the grid facility,y
in year y (MWh/yr)
Therefore, annual electricity supplied to the grid by the project (EG ) has been calculated as: facility,y
EG = 59.4.MW (Capacity) x 18% (PLF) x 8760 (hours) facility,y
= 93346.560 MWh
As,
EG = EG , PJ,y facility,y
EG = 93346.560 MWh/yr PJ,y
Therefore, annual Baseline Emissions (BE ) = EG * EF y PJ, y grid, CM, y
= EG * EF facility,y grid, CM, y
= 93346.560 MWh x 0.9777 tCO e/MWh 2
= 91266 tCO e/yr 2

3.2.3 Leakage
The leakage is estimated as follows:
𝐿𝐾 = 𝐿𝐾 (11) 𝑡 𝐴𝐺𝑅𝐼𝐶,𝑡
Where:
𝐿𝐾 𝑡 = GHG emissions due to leakage, in year t; tCO 2-e
𝐿𝐾 = Leakage due to the displacement of agricultural activities in year 𝐴𝐺𝑅𝐼𝐶,𝑡
t, as estimated in the tool “Estimation of the increase in GHG
emissions attributable to displacement of pre-project agricultural
activities in A/R CDM project activity”; tCO -e 2
According to the A/R Methodological tool “Estimation of the increase in GHG emissions attributable
to displacement of pre-project agricultural activities in A/R CDM project activity”, leakage emission
resulting from displacement of the activities is composed of decrease in carbon stock in the carbon
pools of the land and change in soil organic carbon stock due to land-use change in the land.
44 𝐿𝐾 = ×(∆𝐶 +∆𝑆𝑂𝐶 ) (12) 𝐴𝐺𝑅𝐼𝐶,𝑡 𝐵𝐼𝑂𝑀𝐴𝑆𝑆,𝑡 𝐿𝑈𝐶,𝑡 12
Where:
𝐿𝐾 = Leakage due to the displacement of agricultural activities in year 𝐴𝐺𝑅𝐼𝐶,𝑡
t; tCO -e 2
∆𝐶 = Decrease in carbon stock in the carbon pools of the land 𝐵𝐼𝑂𝑀𝐴𝑆𝑆,𝑡
receiving the activity displaced in year t; t d.m
∆𝑆𝑂𝐶 = Change in soil organic carbon (SOC) stock due to land-use 𝐿𝑈𝐶,𝑡
change in the land receiving the displaced activity in year t; tC ha
The project was implemented by manual operation, rather than mechanical operation. Besides, no
weeding, chopping, pruning, intermediate cutting activities are going to be conducted during the
crediting period because of the natural condition, the economic condition and the slow growth
pattern. Fertilization and watering are not going to take place, neither. Therefore, there is no
expected leakage due to decrease in carbon stock in the carbon pools of the land and change in
soil organic carbon stock. In other words, there is no expected leakage due to the displacement of
agricultural activity from the project activity.
Therefore, leakage is zero for the proposed project.
3.2.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
Net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks
The net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks shall be calculated as follows:

Project Description: VCS Version 4.0
Per the VCS guidelines, a mandatory baseline re-evaluation is to be executed at a minimum of every 10
years after the project start. Therefore, there will be a mandatory baseline re-evaluation on or before 1
June 2027 and on or before 1 June 2037.
PDR.9 A timeline including the first anticipated monitoring period showing when project
activities will be implemented.
The first monitoring period extends from the project start date of 1 June 2017 through 31 December
2019. Project measures have already been implemented within the initial Kamlapar ILG. These
measures include forest patrols and remote sensing of natural and anthropogenic disturbances within
the PAI. These are discussed in more detail in section 5.
PDR.10 A timeline for anticipated subsequent monitoring periods.
The first monitoring period extends from the project start date of 1 June 2017 through 31 December
2019. Project activities have already been implemented within the Kamlapar ILG, the first PAI included
in the project. These activities include forest inventories including land use patrols, remote sensing of
disturbances, and community engagement focused on education and capacity building. These activities
and measures are discussed in more detail in section 5. The project expects to verify every one to two
years to incorporate additional project activity instances.
The timeline for subsequent monitoring periods is flexible, but will likely happen annually when an
additional PAI is added to the project or every other year if no additional PAI is added in the first year of
that respective monitoring period. The project proponent anticipates the addition of a PAI each year,
which would result in one year monitoring periods for the entirety of the project lifetime.

1.11 Description of the Project Activity
The project has identified several factors responsible for deforestation:
 Industrial timber operations, including high-grading and unsustainable extraction.
 Harvest of tropical roundwood for international export.
 Access of secondary agents of deforestation to forested areas and lack of alternative livelihood
options
In order to mitigate these factors and achieve solutions that will reduce deforestation, the project has
planned the following series of actions:
 Preventing large-scale unsustainable industrial timber harvesting and production. This is
undertaken by the project proponent and will reduce the amount of GHG emissions by
preventing large amounts of forest degradation.
 Monitoring of the region to identify and prevent further illegal logging. This will reduce the
amount of deforestation caused by secondary agents of deforestation, thus reducing the
amount of GHG emissions from the project area. NIHT is working with the Kamlapar ILG in the
first PAI to ensure the monitoring and reporting of any illegal logging on their land is carried out.
 Providing electricity in region, either through solar, water, or geothermal means directly reduce
the demand for logged or harvested firewood. This may also indirectly reduce the supply of
wood products by increasing incomes in these areas and providing alternative livelihood
options that do not exploit forest resources. NIHT will be supporting the implementation of this
project activity with clan guidance and input.
 Increasing access to co-benefits such as education, technology, clean water, and healthcare in
the region will aid in expanding opportunities for alternative livelihoods, as well as increase
local stakeholder capacity and support of the project which has the potential to indirectly
decrease pressure on local forests. The project proponent will assist in building partnerships
with relevant institutions and organizations that can support the clans in implementing these
activities through sustainable development pathways.
 Supporting clan business ventures and economic opportunity through supporting sustainable
business options (coconut oil) and offering gainful employment in project activities that will
provide alternative livelihoods that do not result in damage to the forest. The clan committees,
specifically the community development and distribution committees, will work together to

6.5 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
Comparison of actual emission reductions with ex ante estimates:
The monitoring period 19-Jan-2020 to 31-Oct-2021 covers 652 days, and the emission
reductions would have been 232,198 tCO 2e 45 according to the ex ante estimates. The actual
emission reductions achieved during this monitoring period are 205,738 tCO e, which is 11% 2
lower46 than the estimated emission reductions. This is mainly because not all generators were
in operation during the initial months of the monitoring period.
If the actual number of days in operation of each generator taken into consideration, the actual
emission reductions achieved during this monitoring period are 3.10% lower than the ex ante
emissions, as calculated in Table 6-1.

Joint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.1
As mentioned in section 4.1 above, the only GHG emissions applicable to Salto Pilão project
is from water reservoirs of hydro power plants (PE ). However, considering that the project has a HP,y
power density of 1,279.2 W/m2, there are no project emissions involved in the project.
4.3 Leakage
According to the methodology, “no other leakage emissions are considered. The emissions
potentially arising due to activities such as power plant construction and upstream emissions from
fossil fuel use (e.g. extraction, processing, transport etc.) are neglected”.
4.4 Estimated Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
According to the selected approved methodology ACM0002, emission reductions are
calculated as follows:
E R y = B E y − P E y Equation 9
Where:
ER Emission reductions in year y (tCO e/yr); y 2
BE Baseline emissions in year y (tCO e/yr); y 2
PE Project emissions in year y (tCO e/yr). y 2
Considering equation 1, estimated emission reductions of Salto Pilão project is presented in
the table below.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
1.8 Description of the Project Activity
The proposed project activity is installation and operation of 48 WEGs of 800kW each, totalling to
38.4MW. Wind World (India) Limited is the technology supplier. Technical description of technology that
will be installed has already been detailed out in section 1.1 of VCS PD.
The average lifetime of WEG model WW-53 is 20 years. PP conducted third party PLF Assessment for
the proposed project activity. As per the third party report, Plant Load Factor has been calculated to be
22.30%.
The proposed project activity is a Greenfield project and envisages supplying clean energy to NEWNE
regional grid. In the absence of the proposed project activity, equivalent amount of electricity would have
been supplied to the grid by more GHG-intensive means (operation of existing grid-connected power
plants and addition of new generation sources).
Scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project activity has been detailed out in section 1.1
and 1.10 of VCS PD.
The proposed project activity is grid-connected, Greenfield, renewable energy project, which harnesses
the available wind energy in the region, in order to generate electricity and supply the same to the
NEWNE regional grid. The proposed project activity does not consume any amount of fossil fuel, thereby
reducing GHG emissions, which would have otherwise been generated by operation and addition of more
GHG-intensive means.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
3.3 Leakage
The only leakage emission source considered in the selected methodology is leakage due to the
displacement of agricultural activities, and must be calculated using the tool AR-TOOL1531.
In the project area of the first activity instance, as described in sections 1.1, 1.13 and 2.4., there
was not any agricultural activity pervious to the project activity. Therefore, there will not be
displacement of agricultural activities and leakage for the first instance will be set equal to zero
(LK =0). ,t
In future project activity instances, if displacement of agricultural activities occurs, then leakage
will be calculated using equation 5 of AR-AM0014 and equations 1, 2 and 3 of AR-TOOL15.
3.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
Net GHG removals by sink are calculated using the following equation of AR-AM0014:
ΔC = ΔC - ΔC - LK (Equation 21, 6 of AR-AM0014) ARR-VCS,t ACTUAL,t BLS,t ,t
Where:
ΔC = Net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t CO -e ARR-VCS,t 2
ΔC = Actual net GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t CO -e ACTUAL,t 2
ΔC = Baseline net GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t CO -e BLS,t 2
LK = GHG emissions due to leakage, in year t; t CO -e ,t 2
Ex ante estimations of the net GHG removals by sinks in the first project activity instance are
described in the following table.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3
According to the A/R Methodological tool “Estimation of the increase in GHG emissions
attributable to displacement of pre-project agricultural activities in A/R CDM project activity”,
leakage emission resulting from displacement of the activities is composed of decrease in carbon
stock in the carbon pools of the land and change in soil organic carbon stock due to land-use
change in the land.
44 LK = ×(ΔC +ΔSOC )40
AGRIC,t 12 BIOMASS,t LUC,t
Where:
LK = Leakage due to the displacement of agricultural activities in
AGRIC,t year t; tCO -e 2
ΔC = Decrease in carbon stock in the carbon pools of the land
BIOMASS,t receiving the activity displaced in year t; t d.m
ΔSOC = Change in soil organic carbon (SOC) stock due to land-use
LUC,t change in the land receiving the displaced activity in year t; tC
ha
The project was implemented by manual operation, rather than mechanical operation. Besides,
no weeding, chopping, pruning, intermediate cutting activities are going to be conducted during
the crediting period because of the natural condition, the economic condition and the slow growth
pattern. Fertilization and watering are not going to take place, neither.41 Therefore, there is no
expected leakage due to decrease in carbon stock in the carbon pools of the land and change in
soil organic carbon stock. In other words, there is no expected leakage due to the displacement
of agricultural activity from the project activity.
Therefore, leakage is zero for the proposed project.
3.4 Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
The net anthropogenic GHG removals by the project shall be calculated as follows:
∆𝐶 = ∆𝐶 −∆𝐶 −𝐿𝐾 (1) !"",! !""#$!%,! !""#,! !
Where:
∆𝐶 !"",! = Net anthropogenic GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t CO 2-e
∆𝐶 !""#$!%,! = Actual net GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t CO 2-e
∆𝐶 !""#,! = Baseline net GHG removals by sinks, in year t; t CO 2-e
𝐿𝐾 ! = GHG emissions due to leakage, in year t; t CO 2-e
From the previous calculation on baseline emissions and leakage emissions, we learn that
estimated baseline emissions is 6,662.75tCO e for the project, and estimated leakage emissions 2

4.3.1.2. GHG emissions by sources increased as result of project activity
GHG emissions as a result of project activities will be calculated according to the
approved methodology. The project takes into account the increase in emissions of
GHG gases resulting from use of fossil fuel, biomass loss and the use of fertilizer.
Fossil fuel combustion, for instance, occurs during thinning and harvesting activities,
but the methodology excludes transportation fuel.
where:
GHG Annual GHG emissions as result of the implementation of the A/R project activity within the E,t project boundary; tonnes CO-e yr-1 in year t 2 E CO emissions from combustion of fossil fuels within the project boundary; tonnes CO-e yr-1 FuelBurn,t 2 2
in year t
E GHG emissions from the loss of biomass in site preparation and conversion to A/R within the BiomassLoss,t project boundary; tonnes CO-e yr-1 in year t 2
E Non-CO2 emission as a result of biomass burning within the project boundary; tonnes CO-e Non- 2 yr-1 in year t CO2,BiomassBurn,t
T Ranges from 1 to end of crediting period; years
The project participants assume that a small amount of GHG emissions will result
from site preparation and plantation management activities. However, the proposed
A/R project activity does not engage in any burning practices during site preparation.
Further, conversion of herbaceous vegetation can be neglected, and the loss of GHG
sequestered in woody biomass will not occur since trees and shrubs will not be
removed.
However, for the project participants, it is a difficult task to estimate ex ante GHG
emissions with a high degree of accuracy. To maintain a conservative approach for
the ex-ante calculation, the proposed A/R project activity applies a default 10%
project GHG emission value based on the CO2-e stock in living biomass of trees in
the project scenario However, this value will probably be adjusted during the
verification process.

4.3.2. Leakage
See 9 Baseline Report (Step 8), and 10 Monitoring (7. Monitoring leakage).
The methodology AR-AM0005 considers two sources of leakage:
LK = LK +LK
t Displacement_grazing,t Fuelwood,t
where:
LK Increase of GHG emissions outside the project boundary; tonnes CO-e yr-1 in year t t 2
LK Increase of GHG emissions outside the project boundary resulting from displacement of Displacement_grazing,t grazing activities; tonnes CO-e yr-1 in year t 2
LK Increase of GHG emissions outside the project boundary resulting from displacement of fuel Fuelwood,t wood collection; tonnes CO-e yr-1 in year t 2
T Ranges from 1 to end of crediting period; years
However, the displacement of grazing activities to other grasslands (without
overgrazing) does not result in leakage. Generally it is assumed that grazing activities
continue to be executed in an extensive manner within the project boundaries and
commercial animal farming is not present. Hence, leakage from displacement of
grazing activities is considered to be zero:
Further, there is no collection of firewood in the baseline scenario of the project area.
Therefore, this variable is set to zero:
139 Project emissions are estimated to be a percentage of the estimated accumulated tCO2e sequestered through the
A/R project activity.

5.5 LEAKAGE (CL2)
As the baseline scenario is primarily driven by illegal commercial logging there is potential activity –shifting and
market-effects leakage. As identified by the timber study, the activity-shifting leakage is geographically
constrained by proximity to transportation routes and accessibility.
5.5.1 ESTIMATING EMISSIONS FROM LEAKAGE
Emissions from leakage are quantified two approaches for the purposes of ex-ante estimates. First, leakage is
quantified by defining a leakage area and adjusting baseline rates of deforestation and degradation in the leakage
area using leakage cancellation rates. And second, by making reasonable assumptions about the proportion of
merchantable biomass in the project region based on the results of the timber study to apply a conservative
market-effects leakage discount. The first approach is summarized in Section 5.5.2 while the second in Section
5.5.5. All calculations are provided in VM0006 Accounting ACAPA-BMF v10.15.xlsm.
For the purposes of ex-post estimates, the leakage area is monitored for increases in deforestation and
degradation relative to predicted baseline levels. The market-effects discount factor is applied until the time of
baseline reassessment.
5.5.2 ESTIMATE LEAKAGE FROM GEOGRAPHICALLY CONSTRAINED DRIVERS
Ex-ante leakage from geographically unconstrained drivers is estimated by estimating the leakage-induced increase
in deforestation and degradation rates as a result of project activities and then adding this increase to the
predicted baseline rates of deforestation and degradation for the leakage area. The baseline rates of deforestation
and degradation are presented in Section 5.3.5 while the leakage-induced increase is described in Section 5.5.2.1.

3.4 Estimated Net GHG Emission Reductions and Removals
Baseline Emissions
As per the equation 6 of the methodology ACM 0002 (Version 17.0),
BE = EG , * EF (1) y PJ y grid, CM, y
Where:
BE : Baseline emissions in year y (tCO e/yr) y 2
EG : Quantity of net electricity generation that is produced and fed into the grid as a PJ, y
result of the implementation of the CDM project activity in year y (MWh/yr)
EF : Combined margin CO emission factor for grid connected power generation in grid, CM, y 2
year y calculated using the latest version of the “Tool to calculate the emission
factor for an electricity system” (tCO e/MWh) 2
Thus, BE = EG , * EF y PJ y grid, CM, y
BE = 368,856 (MWh)* 0.99 tCO /MWh y 2
BE = 364,244 tCO y 2
Project Emissions
As per the para 36 of methodology ACM 0002 (Version 17.0), “For most renewable power
generation project activities, PE = 0. y
Leakage Emissions
As per para 5.6 of the methodology ACM 0002 (Version 17.0) does not consider any leakage
emissions.
Emission reductions
As per equation number (17) of the applied methodology, emission reductions are calculated as
follows:
ER = BE – PE (7) y y y
Where:
ER Emission reductions in year y (tCO e/yr) y 2
BE Baseline emissions in year y (tCO e/yr) y 2
PE Project emissions in year y (tCO e/yr) y 2
Thus, ER = 364,244 – 0 tCO y 2
= 364,244 tCO 2

4.4.2 Project Verified Carbon Units
The number of Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) for each year t in the project crediting period is the
greenhouse gas emission reductions and removals adjusted for uncertainty and risk.
Adjustment for uncertainty
Estimated greenhouse gas emissions and emission reductions from IFM activities have uncertainties
associated with parameters and coefficients including estimates of area, carbon stocks, regrowth and
expansion factors. It is assumed that the uncertainties associated with input data are available, either
as default uncertainty values given in most recent IPCC guidelines, or as statistical estimates based on
sampling.
Uncertainty at all times is defined at the 95% confidence interval where the estimated variance exceeds
+/- 15 percent from the mean. Procedures including stratification and the allocation of sufficient
measurement plots will help ensure that low uncertainty results and ultimately full crediting can result.
Uncertainties arising from the measurement and monitoring of carbon pools and greenhouse gases
shall always be quantified. Errors in each pool shall be weighted by the size of the pool so that projects
may reasonably target a lower precision level in pools that only form a small proportion of the total
stock.
For both the baseline and the with-project case the total uncertainty is equal to the square root of the
sum of the squares of each component uncertainty and is calculated at the time of reporting through
propagating the error in the baseline stocks and the error in the project stocks.
Therefore, total uncertainty for LtPF project is calculated as:
