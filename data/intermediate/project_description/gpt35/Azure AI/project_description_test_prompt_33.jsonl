Since\nthese rice paddies are all legal agricultural fields, and the ownership is clear, there is no dispute\nover land ownership at the project site.\nDuring the construction period, Hainan Sunsea Ecological Agriculture Technology Co., Ltd.\n(hereinafter \"Sunsea\u201d or \u201cproject proponent\u201d) invested and cooperated with the local agricultural\nauthorities in the construction of ditches and reservoirs. The local farmers were hired to do the\nconstruction. During the construction period, Sunsea was responsible for supervising technicians\nto patrol and maintain the ditches and reservoirs.

Therefore, Cypress Carbon has played two roles in developing the\ncarbon reduction project. Firstly, Cypress Carbon is the consultant who is responsible for helping\nthe project proponent with development and management of the carbon project, including\ncompiling the monitoring plan, organizing the training, etc. Secondly, Cypress Carbon is the\npurchaser, so it has right of speech for marketing. Although Sunsea has already sold the carbon\nemission reduction generated by this project to Cypress Carbon, it does not affect Sunsea\u2019s rights\nand obligations as the project proponent.\n1.8 Project Start Date\nAccording to VCS standard, v4.2, the project start date is the date on which activities that lead\nto the generation of GHG emission reductions or removals are implemented (e.g., preparing land\nfor seeding, planting, changing agricultural or forestry practices, rewetting, restoring hydrological\nfunctions, or implementing management or protection plans). For this project, according to the\nrequirements of the AMS-III.AU methodology applied, an entire cropping season is started from\nland preparation and the emission reduction calculation is also started on this day.

The design lifetime of the ditches in this project is 30 years, so the project\nlifetime is 30 years. The project's lifetime starts from the date the ditches are completed, so the start date of the project lifetime is earlier\nthan the project's start date.\n4 Section 3.8 of the VCS Standard, v4.2 states that \u201cThe project crediting period is the time for which GHG emission reductions or removals\ngenerated by the project are eligible for issuance as VCUs.\u201d According to the Methodology of Methane emission reduction by adjusted water\nmanagement practice in rice cultivation, the time when the project produces emission reductions is the start time of land preparation. And\nthe land preparation means the start of a rice season. The main activity of this project is emission reduction due to the adjusted water\nregime during rice cultivation, which means emission reduction for each year only occurred thought the rice-growing season. Therefore,\nalthough the crediting period in 2018 does not start from 1st January, it has already included the whole rice-growing season in a year.\n5 The rice planting starts on 30-March-2025, with no emission reduction during the non-planting period, so there will be no emission\nreductions from 01-January-2025 to 29-March-2025.\n8\n\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\n1.15 Participation under Other GHG Programs\nProjects Registered (or seeking registration) under Other GHG Program(s)\nThe project is seeking registration only in the VCS program.\nProjects Rejected by Other GHG Programs\nThe project has not been rejected by any other GHG programs.\n1.16 Other Forms of Credit\nEmissions Trading Programs and Other Binding Limits\nThe project is not involved in an emission trading program or any other mechanism that includes\nGHG allowance trading and has not been rejected by other GHG programs.

Often, wind turbines in Tamil Nadu\nhave been asked to back down12 as power generation in thermal power\nstations had been running at their peak resulting in high frequency in\nthe grid. Thus the TNEB 13 is not able to evacuate power that the\nwindmill units are generating. This leads to low sales realization,\nwhich results in low returns for the project promoters.\n\uf0b7 Breakdown of Gear Box: The most critical component in a wind\nelectric generator is the gear box. Failure of the gear box is a real\nbarrier for a wind mill due to non availability of spares readily for\nWTGs of small capacities. At times, the spares are not available for\nthe entire season, thus the wind mill is not able to operate during the\npeak wind potential season. Hence the maintenance problems of the\ngearbox are deterrent to entrench the wind farms.\n1.12 Demonstration to confirm that the project was not implemented to\ncreate GHG emissions primarily for the purpose of its subsequent\nremoval or destruction.\nThe project proponents have invested in WTGs primarily for the purpose\nof selling the generated power to the TNEB. Hence, the project was not\nimplemented to create GHG emissions primarily for the purpose of its\nsubsequent removal or destruction.\n1.13 Demonstration that the project has not created another form of\nenvironmental credit (for example renewable energy certificates).\nThe project activity does not result in creation of any other kind of\nenvironmental credit14 as per applicable rules in India. However, WTGs\nbundled project activity under CDM validation process and PP will claim\ncredits under VER only till the registration under CDM15.\n1.14 Project rejected under other GHG programs (if applicable):\nThe project activity has never been rejected under any other GHG\nprogram.

On the contrary, one of its main\nobjectives is to integrate trees without losing the previous land cover. The conservation of\ngrasslands is essential for a system to be defined as silvopastoral. No native ecosystems are\ndestroyed for the implementation of this project.\nIn \u201cLa Abuelita\u201d, located in Tacuaremb\u00f3, 10 years before the start of the silvopastoral project, part\nof the area was forested (conventional high-density plantations) and the other part were\ngrasslands, with 140 and 47 ha respectively. In that moment, the forest plantation was set in a\nhigh-density framework displacing all other activities in the affected area (including livestock\nwhich only could graze firewalls or in-between areas). Furthermore, plantations were not pruned\nnor thinned because the timber was aimed to be used for pulp or energy industries.\nFigure 11 shows the image of the farm in 2009, taken by LANDSAT-5 satellite.

The environmental aspects in\nconsideration are as follows:\n\u2022 In comparison to other sources of power generation prevailing in the country, wind power\nis the cleanest technology.\n12\n\nJoint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.0\n\u2022 As compared to other power plants, less amount of land is required for a single wind\nturbo generator.\n\u2022 Wind power is renewable. It can be used continuously, whenever available. There is no\ndanger of depletion of the raw material used for power generation.\n\u2022 Wind power is a naturally available source of energy. There is no processing required to\nmake it available for power generation.\nThus, wind power technology goes hand-in-hand with the environmental well-being of the region.\nTechnological well-being:\nThe power generation technology used in this project activity is provided by M\/s. Suzlon Energy\nLimited. The technological well-being envisaged by the project promoter is as follows:\n\u2022 It will boost the use of such technology by other project developers.\n\u2022 Successful implementation and operation of this project will give necessary impetus in\nimplementation of similar technology in the region.\n\u2022 The project activity will lead to transfer of environmentally safe and sound technologies\nthat are comparable to best practices in order to assist in upgradation of the\ntechnological base in the local region.\nEconomic well-being:\nEconomic well-being refers to additional investment consistent with the needs of the local\ncommunity. The project in due course of time will draw additional investment to the region. In\ngeneral, the project activity envisages following economic benefits:\n\u2022 Employment opportunities\n\u2022 Market facilities for local products\n\u2022 Industrial development\n\u2022 Improvement of a rural economy\n\u2022 Flow of goods and services\nAlthough the realization of the above benefits would take a longer time needlessly, the economic\ndevelopment of the region would be attributed to the project operation. The project will contribute\nto the sustainable development of the region during its entire operational life.\nFurther Information\nThere are no information or incidents that will have bearing on the eligibility of the project, the\nnet GHG emission reductions or removals, or the quantification of the project\u2019s net GHG emission\nreductions or removals.\n13\n\nJoint Project Description & Monitoring Report: VCS Version 4.0\n2 SAFEGUARDS\n2.1 No Net Harm\nAccording to Indian regulation, the implementation of the wind park does not require an\nenvironmental impact assessment.
