In the case of agricultural land-\nuses, the activities are mainly conducted by heavy machinery and continuous plantation cycles, leading\nto soil compaction and fertility impoverishment (Bot and Benites, 2005; Cherubin et al. 2016). In the\nabsence of the project, the project areas would remain dominated by land-uses of low-carbon stock\nand\/or continue to be occupied by non-native ecosystems as a consequence of anthropic activities. Thus,\nno restoration activities would take place and the target lands would remain with reduced concentrations\nof carbon per hectare, resulting in a small contribution to greenhouse gases (GHG) removals.\nThe project is expected to generate several positive impacts, e.g.: an increase in habitat availability for\nbiodiversity and the reduction of atmospheric CO2 via ecological restoration. Significant positive social\nimpacts are expected to be generated through the short- and long-term activities of the project. The\nproject will directly provide local employment opportunities during restoration, monitoring, and harvesting\nphases and indirectly through activities such as seed collection, nursery operations and planting. These\nactivities strengthen the local restoration value chain and support local communities.\nThe project\u2019s first Project Activity Instance (PAI-001) has 365 hectares and is located in the municipality\nof Eun\u00e1polis-Bahia\/Brazil.

{"input":"Question: What is the project proponents, includind organization name, phone number and email address, city and country of the entity responsible for managing this carbon project?\n\nContext: \n\nVCS Project Description Template\npreparation and installation and the capital cost involved is much higher than other\nfossil fuel based power plants.\nRenewable energy in the southern part of India, especially hydro and wind is heavily\ndependent on the monsoon situation. There are no perennial rivers for hydro power\nprojects and the wind density is highest only during the monsoons. The lack of proper\nmonsoon rainfall affects both the hydro and wind power projects severely. Continuous\ndroughts over three years led to a drop in output from renewable energy projects in the\nentire southern region, including Karnataka. This affects the wind projects and reduces\npower generation that affects the projected income.\nThe extent of GHG mitigation due to the project activity is directly related to extent of\npower generated in the wind turbines. There is a possibility of lesser generation of\npower and hence the GHG emission mitigation due to any or a combination of the\nfollowing reasons:\n\u2022 Seasonal variations in the wind flow patterns\n\u2022 Variations in the machine availability and machine down time\n\u2022 Problems with the evacuation of the power generated due to non-\navailability of grid\n1.12 Demonstration to confirm that the project was not implemented to create\nGHG emissions primarily for the purpose of its subsequent removal or\ndestruction.\nThe project activity involves installation of the wind turbine machinery for the\ngeneration of electricity by harnessing renewable source of energy, that is, wind\npower. Hence, there were no emissions at the onset of the project activity so the\npossibility of the subsequent removal or destruction is ruled out.\n1.13 Demonstration that the project has not created another form of\nenvironmental credit (for example renewable energy certificates).\nThe proposed VCS project activity has not created any other form of environmental\ncredits.

Accordingly,\nthe energy baseline being considered is as directed in paragraph 9 of the\nAMS.I.D\/Version 13, that provides that the applicable baseline is the energy (in kWh)\nproduced by the renewable generating unit multiplied by an emission coefficient\n(measured in kg CO2e\/kWh) calculated in a transparent and conservative manner as:\n(a) A combined margin (CM), consisting of the combination of operating margin\n(OM) and build margin (BM) according to the procedures prescribed in the\napproved methodology ACM0002.

The data of the year in which project generation occurs must be used.\nCalculations must be based on data from an official source (where available)\nand made publicly available.\nWith the purpose of providing a ready reference for the emission coefficients to be\nused in CDM projects, Central Electricity Authority (CEA), Government of India, has\npublished, \u201cCO2 Baseline Database for the Indian Power Sector\u201d, Version 4.0,\nOctober 2008. This database is an official publication of the Government of India for\nthe purpose of CDM baselines.

In order to determine GHG mitigation in a conservative manner, no\ntransmission and distribution losses have been considered. In order to determine the\nemission in a baseline scenario, the emission factor is multiplied by the net power\ngenerated by the wind energy generators. The project emission in the proposed CDM\nproject has been taken as zero tCO2e\/MWh, as wind is a zero GHG emitting\nrenewable form of energy.\nThe project assists in enhancing sustainable development in India as detailed in the\nfollowing aspects:\nSocial well being: The proposed VCS project activity leads to alleviation of poverty\nby generating additional employment opportunities for the local people of the project\narea both during the construction phase and the entire lifetime of the project.

The proposed project activity is promoted\nby Sai Pet Preforms Limited with a view to align itself with sustainable development policies of India\nhas undertaken this project to produce green power using wind and solar as an energy source.\nThe 2 MW wind power project site in Karnataka is located in Bableshwar Wind Park at Malaghan\nvillage at Basavana Bagewadi Taluka at Vijayapura district and 0.85 MW wind power project in\nGujarat is located at Village Juna kataria, Khodasar of Bhachhau Taluka falling under Kutch district.\nOn the other hand, the 3.5 MW solar PV power generation project site is located at Upparhalli\nvillage Hospet taluka within Bellari district of Karnataka. The generated electricity from this project\nactivity is exported to the Indian grid. Electricity generated from 2 MW wind power plant in\nKarnataka is supplied to the local electricity distribution licensee Hubli Electricity Supply Company\nLimited (HESCOM), electricity generated from 0.85 MW wind power plant in Gujarat is supplied to\nGujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) while the 3.5 MW solar PV power plant supplies\nelectricity to Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company Limited (GESCOM).\nThe project activity helps in Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by using renewable\nresources (wind\/solar energy) for generating power which otherwise would have been generated\nusing grid mix power plants, which is dominated by fossil fuel based thermal power plants. The\nproject activity is a Greenfield project aimed at utilizing wind and solar energy sources to generate\nelectricity. In the pre-project scenario, the equivalent amount of electricity would have been\ngenerated by grid mix power plants connected Indian grid, which is dominated by fossil fuel based\nthermal power plant. The project activity will thus reduce the anthropogenic emissions of Green\nHouse Gases (GHGs) in to the atmosphere associated with the equivalent amount of electricity\ngeneration from the fossil fuel-based grid connected power plant.

A.\u015e. (referred to as Irmak Enerji from here on) has developed EREN\nHydroelectric Power Project (in short: EREN HEPP), a run-of-river hydro power plant (HPP) on Soganli\ncreek. EREN HEPP will use water supply of Soganli creek in Safranbolu district which is located in City of\nKarabuk. The project is in borders of nine villages (Yukariguney, Sofcular, Alakaya, Kayaoren, Caykasi,\nTerke in Kastamonu, Asagiguney,Geren in Karabuk, Kavak in Cankiri). EREN HEPP is a run-of-river\nhydro power plant where regulator located on Soganli creek at 524.50 meters. Overflow flux is calculated\nas 433.76 m3\/sec. Transmission canal for the plant is approximately 35 km. Flowing water then pass\nthrough transmission pipes which has a diameter of 3.2 meters and length of 500 meters into power\nhouse where 3 Francis turbines each having power of 12,346 kW produce energy.\nEREN HEPP is a run-of-river hydro power plant (HPP) project with an installed capacity of 35.186 MW , e\nwhich annually feeds an amount of around 141.899 GWh of emission free electricity into the Turkish\nnational grid according to Electricity Production License, thereby creating an emission reduction of 73,776\ntCO . Irmak Enerji made Right of Water Use Contract with Devlet Su Isleri (DSI - State Hydrolic Works) 2e\non 22.09.2008 and already obtained the electricity generation license of EREN HEPP from Enerji\nPiyasas\u0131 D\u00fczenleme Kurumu \/ Electricity Market Regulatory Authority (EPDK \/ EMRA) on 25.12.2008 for\nthe duration of 49 years. Grid Connection Contract with Turkiye Elektrik Iletim A.S. (TEIAS \u2013 Turkey\nElectricity Transmission Co.) was made on 17.08.2011.\nPurpose of the Project:\na) The scenario existing prior to the start of the implementation of the project is that the electricity demand\nis satisfied by the National Grid of Turkey.\nb) The project is a newly built hydro power plant with the installed capacity of 35.186 MW . The Project e\nwill utilize the water resources of Soganli Creek to generate electricity which will be delivered to the\nNational Grid of Turkey without CO emissions. The Project Activity will achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) 2\nemission reductions by avoiding CO emissions from the business-as-usual scenario, electricity 2\ngenerated by those fossil fuel-fired power plants connected into the National Grid of Turkey.\nc) The baseline scenario of the Project is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of the\nimplementation of the Project.\nContributions to Sustainable Development:\nIn addition to reduce GHG emissions by producing clean energy, the Project will also make contributions\nto the sustainable development of the local communities and the host country by means of;\ntter use of renewable hydro power energy and play a positive role in the local renewable\nenergy industry,\nenergy demand,\no the business-as-usual scenario, which is electricity generation\nby the country\u2019s generation mix mainly dominated by fossil fuel-fired power plants,\nopportunities\nBuilding a HEPP contributes to a sustainable expansion path of the Turkish energy system, as it serves\nthe steadily growing electricity demand in an environmentally suitable way. The project also contributes to\ndissemination of state-of-the-art new renewable energy (REN) technology, thus increasing the use of\necologically sound domestic energy sources in Turkish electricity supply.\nThe project's ecological impact has been assessed by preparing first a project presentation file (Turkish:\nProje Tan\u0131t\u0131m Dosyas\u0131, PTD).

A Full\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report has been also submitted to the Turkish Ministry of\nEnvironment and Forestry. At 31\/12\/2010, a certificate of Environmental Impact Assessment has been\nreceived from Turkish Ministry of Environment and Forestry. A summary of the PTD and evidence for the\nT\u00c7OB decision are presented in Section 5 below.\nIn fact, there are essential positive environmental effects, as highly polluting electricity generation\ntechnologies are displaced by the project. Pollution not only comprises greenhouse gases but other local\nair pollutants such as SO , NO , or Particulate Matter, as well. x x\nAs for social impacts, significant positive employment effects will be occurred especially during the\nconstruction and installation period, where more than 50 people have been working for the project. . It is\naimed to employ local people to add social impact to the project. Moreover, local companies benefit from\nthe project, as construction services and material are mainly sourced from local suppliers. Management,\noperation and maintenance of the HEPP create permanent jobs which require high qualification,\ncontributing to capacity building and know-how dissemination in Turkey.\nIn addition to contribution to local economy, the project will also contribute the use of local and renewable\nresources to meet the increasing energy demand of Turkey and reduce dependency on fossil fuels. In\nterms of fuel dependency, EREN HEPP is expected to contribute to domestic energy production by\nreducing that much imported energy, which will, in addition increase air quality and access to affordable\nenergy services in national level. EREN HEPP displaces electricity from the current generation mix which\nis based to a large amount on thermal power plants and will affect the planned capacity extension of the\nelectricity system. EREN HEPP thus leads to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reductions which are to\nbe accounted for by verifying and issuing carbon credits under the Verified Carbon Standard Version\n3.4., (in short VCS version 3.4.).\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nAccording to guidance from VCS version 3.4 EREN HEPP falls under sectorial scope no. 1 \"Energy\n(renewable\/non-renewable)\".The project type is Renewable Energy (REN).

The law allows\nthe delegation of limited tenure and sustainable use rights of renewable natural resources to a\nlegally-recognized local community institution (a Communaut\u00e9 de Base (COBA)), in exchange\nfor a contractual obligation vis-\u00e0-vis the government to conserve the transferred natural\nresources. Decree 2001-122 governs the implementation of devolved forest resource\nmanagement to local communities (Decree 2001-122, D\u00e9cret fixant les conditions de mise en\noeuvre de la Gestion Contractualis\u00e9e des For\u00eats de l\u2019Etat (GCF)). It allows forest specific\ncommunity management contracts. Under GCF, contracts are signed between the\ngovernment and the representative of the COBAs, the Community Management Committee\n(COGE). The request must come from the local community. In 2004, CI began working with\nthe Ministry of Water and Forests and the communities surrounding the COFAV forests to\nimplement community-managed GCF sites within the community use zone of the project area.\nThe COFAV project makes use of the GELOSE legislation in some areas to transfer\nmanagement rights of forests to local communities.\nDina\nDina are traditional laws established by the community through broad consensus. For\nCOFAV, local communities established Dina for the community management of their forest\nresources in fulfilment of the GELOSE\/GCF. In compliance to forestry law, the Dina were\nagreed to and formalised by all of the main stakeholders, including the local communities\n(COBAs) to which the management of forest resources were transferred, the local authorities,\nand the regional representatives of the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Ministry\nof Justice for each of the GELOSE \/ GCF sites implemented.\nA complete list of relevant Malagasy legislation is presented in Appendix 3: Relevant\nMalagasy legislation.\n1.12 Ownership and Other Programs\n1.12.1 Proof of Title\nThe Government of Madagascar (GoM) through the Ministry responsible for forests (the\nMinistry of Environment and Forests - MEF at the time of PD development) is the project\nproponent and owner of the VCUs generated by the project activity. All the forest in the\nproject area is owned by the Government of Madagascar and the government is responsible\nfor project activities and therefore VCUs generated remain the property of the government.\nThe Government of Madagascar has delegated the protected area management to CI through\na management delegation contract. The delegated project manager and local community\nassociations are all part of the management structure and will therefore share responsibility\nfor deciding how the revenues from the sale of VCUs will be used to achieve the project\nobjectives through the development of annual work plans and budgets that have to be\napproved by the whole management structure.\nTable 6 summarises the land tenure and ownership of the project area, described below:\n1.

Without the implementation of this\nproject, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously\nflooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously\nflooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded\ncondition can emit a large amount of methane (CH ) because of anaerobic decomposition, 4\nthe intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase\nand methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results\nin not only large amount of methane (CH ) emissions but also low rice productivity by 4\nreplacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens\nthe period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter.
