Hence, if a potential area with this feature emerges, the analysis will be\nconducted at this instance level.\nImplementation of the proposed project provides various positive impacts on the environment, such as\nincreased forest stocks, especially considering the baseline scenario of non-forested areas. As part of\nthe package of incentives offered by the PP, the partners will be encouraged to adopt independent forest\ncertification practices, which include criteria that are even more rigorous than the Brazilian legislation.\n29 Sources: http:\/\/www.rbma.org.br\/rbma\/rbma_fase_vi_06_estados_pr.asp and\nhttp:\/\/www.rbma.org.br\/rbma\/rbma_fase_vi_06_estados_sc.asp.\n39\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\n2.2 Local Stakeholder Consultation\nTo identify potential stakeholders, it was considered the area within a 10km radius of the first instance\nfarm.

Without the implementation of this\nproject, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously\nflooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously\nflooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded\ncondition can emit a large amount of methane (CH ) because of anaerobic decomposition, 4\nthe intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase\nand methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results\nin not only large amount of methane (CH ) emissions but also low rice productivity by 4\nreplacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens\nthe period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter.

{"input":"Question: What is the project summary, province, country, latitude, and longitude of this project?\n\nContext: \n\n1 PROJECT DETAILS\n1.1 Summary Description of the Project\nThe Mariposas Hydroelectric Project, or hereafter the \u201cProject\u201d, consists of the construction and\noperation of a Run-Of-River hydropower plant of 6.3 MW. The Project uses the waters of the first\nsection of the Maule Norte Alto canal, in the San Clemente commune, Province of Talca, VII Region\ndel Maule in the country of Chile. The project can generate an average of 40 GWh per year (72.5%\nplant factor).\nThe Project operates with one vertical Compact Axial Turbine (CAT) connected directly to a\nsynchronous generator, obtaining an installed total power of 6.3 MW. The generators are connected\nto a power transformer elevating the voltage from 6.6 kV to 69 kV in the Mariposas substation. The\nProject electric generation is supplied to the National Electric Grid (\u201cSistema El\u00e9ctrico Nacional\u201d in\nSpanish, hereafter SEN) by a single-circuit 69 kV transmission line, connecting the Project to the\nexisting Lircay substation at 7 km north from the Mariposas powerhouse.\nThe aim of the Project is to generate electricity from renewable hydrological resources, using water\nutilized by the local community for irrigation purposes. The development of the Project however, does\nnot affect the local irrigators since the water used for generating electricity is then restored to the same\nirrigation system, before the local community uses it.\nThe Project reduces greenhouse gas emissions produced by thermal electric plants, fired with fossil\nfuels, which are currently in operation in Chile.\nThe project boundary encompasses the Mariposas power plant itself and all the power plants\nconnected to the SEN grid, which is the relevant grid to which the run-of-river power plant is\nconnected to. The baseline scenario for the Project is the continuing operation of the existing and\nfuture power plants in the SEN, without the Mariposas hydroelectric power plant electricity\ngeneration, to meet the actual electricity demand of the system. The Project is expected to generate\n18,219 tCO e\/yr (on average) and a total of 182,190 tCO e during the second 10-year crediting 2 2\nperiod.\nThe Project was developed and is operated by Hidroel\u00e9ctrica R\u00edo Lircay S.A. (hereafter Hidrolircay),\nrelated to Hidromaule S.A.1, company formed on June 2005 with the aim to develop small hydro\nprojects in Chile. Its first project is the Lircay Run-Of-River Project (CDM Project id 2417), which\nstarted with the agreement between Hidromaule S.A. and Asociaci\u00f3n Canal Maule, hereafter ACM.\nIn October of 2009 Hidroel\u00e9ctrica R\u00edo Lircay S.A. and ACM signed the agreement for water rights\nuse for the Mariposas Hydroelectric Project, which states a non consumptive water use of 20 m3\/s\nfor electric generation purposes.\n1 Hidromaule S.A. has the same shareholders that Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Ri\u00f3 Lircay S.A., however they do not have equity participation\non each other.\n\n[['Audit Type', 'Period', None, None, 'Program', 'VVB Name', None, None, 'Number of years'], ['Validation', '27-February-\\n2012', None, None, 'Verified Carbon\\nStandard', '', 'DNV GL', '', '10'], [None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Climate', None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Change', None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Services', None, None], ['Verification N\u00b01', '', '01-January-', '', 'Verified Carbon\\nStandard', 'T\u00dcV Nord Cert\\nGmbH', 'T\u00dcV Nord Cert', None, '2'], [None, None, '2011\u201431-', None, None, None, 'GmbH', None, None], [None, None, 'December-', None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, '2012', None, None, None, None, None, None], ['Verification N\u00b02', '', '01-January-', '', 'Verified Carbon\\nStandard', 'T\u00dcV Nord Cert\\nGmbH', None, None, '1'], [None, None, '2013\u201431-', None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, 'December-', None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, '2013', None, None, None, None, None, None], ['Re-Validation', '27-January-\\n2023', '27-January-', None, 'Verified Carbon\\nStandard', '', 'Earthood', '', '10'], [None, None, '2023', None, None, None, 'Services', None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Private', None, None], [None, None, None, None, None, None, 'Limited', None, None], ['Total', '', '51,941 tCO 2e', '', '', '', '', None, ''], [None, None, '(Verification', None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, 'N\u00b01 +', None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, 'Verification', None, None, None, None, None, None], [None, None, 'N\u00b02)', None, None, None, None, None, None]]\n[['27-February-'], ['2012']]\n[['Verified Carbon'], ['Standard']]\n[['Verified Carbon'], ['Standard']]\n[['Verified Carbon'], ['Standard']]\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.2\nACM consist of near 2,200 independent local irrigators with consumptive water rights in the Maule\nbasin for about 54.3 m3\/s, who have agreed the construction of the Project and use 20 m3\/s as non-\nconsumptive water rights, subject to annual payments for the use of the water rights.\nSince the Project is only a 6.3 MW power unit, it is considered under the Chilean legislation as Non-\nConventional Renewable Generation Means, as per article 225 aa) of the Chilean General Electric\nService Law Directive (DFL4\/2006), published on 17\/01\/2006 in the Official Gazette (available at\nwww.bcn.cl).\nThe Project was submitted to the Environmental Impact Assessment process on January 2009,\nthrough an Environmental Impact Statement (DIA in Spanish), not requiring a full Environmental\nImpact Assessment Study due to its low environmental impact.

Without the implementation of this\nproject, which provides ditches to conduct intermittently flooded method, the continuously\nflooded method would be continued, so the scenario that rice was cultivated by continuously\nflooded method is the baseline scenario. Since the organic matter in rice soil under flooded\ncondition can emit a large amount of methane (CH ) because of anaerobic decomposition, 4\nthe intermittent flooded method is more beneficial to water conservation, production increase\nand methane emission reduction than the continuously flooded.\nThis project solved the problems of excessive water used during rice cultivation which results\nin not only large amount of methane (CH ) emissions but also low rice productivity by 4\nreplacing the continuously flooded method with intermittent flooded method, which shortens\nthe period of anaerobic decomposition of soil organic matter. In this case, the CH emission 4\ncan be declined by an average of 48%1 . Hence, with the proposed project activity, an\nestimated amount of GHG emission reduction 4.51 tCO e\/ha for single-cropping rice is 2\nexpected.\nThe implementation of the project is expected to reduce the GHG emissions amounting to\n419,272 tCO e in the first 7 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 2\n59,896tCO e. 2\nThis project aims to:\n- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate changes;\n- Increase the rice productivity resulting in higher living standard of local farmers;\n- Provide more job opportunities, especially women workers;\n- Use a proportion of benefits to improve the local children\u2019s education.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\nThe project is developed under VCS scope 14 \u201cAgriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use\n(AFOLU)\u201d with an activity category of Improved Cropland Management (ICM) under\nAgricultural Land Management (ALM).

The terminal will annually import about 3.7 million tons of LNG from Australia\u2019s Northwest Shelf gas development project over the next 25 \nyears and mainly supply g as to Shenzhen, Dongguan, Gu angzhou, Foshan and Hong \nKong and five power plants. The second phase is  expected to raise the capacity of the \nproject to 6.2 million tons a year. Gas has so me special features which distinguish it from \nother commodities, it is delivered through a long fixed chain (from exploration to final users) capacity-bound investment. The specific features of natural gas means the natural \ngas project had to be protected by long-ter m contracts with strict supply and off-take \nobligations. To hedge the risk, The Gu angdong Dapeng LNG, operator of the LNG \nproject also signed take-or-pay (ToP) lo ng-term contracts with potential demand \nconsumers. Such long-term contract along the LNG chain make sure that there is no supply constrain (all LNG demand have been contracted), thus no possible leakage. \nAdditionally, in the LNG supply contract, ther e is clause to ensure that the LNG will be \nsupplied preferentially to household user once th ere is supply constrain.

The\nproject is developed under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) methodology VM0003 v1.2 -\nMethodology for Improved Forest Management Through Extension of Rotation Age (IFM ERA).\nEjidos are collective-property lands conceded by the Federal Mexican government to a group of\npeople called ejidatarios, who possess the right to manage and harvest the forest and other natural\nresources located within the ejido. Ejidos have three different land classes, human settlements,\nparcelled lands (for the individual use and management of lands) and common-use lands that are\nmanaged by the ejido\u2019s general assembly. The Project Areas of The XiCO2e: Mexican Peninsula\nForest Project are in the common-use lands.\nThe Project Area covers 132,903 ha to develop a carbon forestry project, which are the eligible areas\nfor commercial harvesting purposes under the current forest management plans prior project\nimplementation. Harvesting prescriptions in the 15 ejidos consist in selection cuts of tropical species\nin annual management units, each of which corresponds to one year of the total rotation period (25\nyears), therefore the project area in each ejido is divided in as many units as the years in the rotation\nperiod.\nThe Project Area is comprised of semi-evergreen tropical forest with a broad species diversity,\nhaving as primary target commercial species mahogany (Sweitenia macrophilla), Spanish cedar\n(Cedrela odorata), sapotilla (Manilkara zapota), fiddlewood (Vitex gaumeri), Tsalam (Lysiloma\nbahamensis), ramon (Brosimum alicastrum),katalox (Swartzia cubensis), shaving bush tree\n(Psedobombax ellipticum), copper wood (Bursera simaruba) and chechen (Metopium brownei),\namong several other tropical commercial species.\nThe project will increase the minimum-cut diameter of commercial species, thereby extending the\nrotation age. The project is expected to remove over 5,000,000 tonnes of CO e over a 30-year 2\nperiod.\n1.2 Sectoral Scope and Project Type\n\u2022 The Project is within the sectoral scope 14; Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use\n(AFOLU).\n\u2022 The AFOLU project category is Improved Forest Management, Extended Rotation Age (IFM\nERA)\n\u2022 The methodology applied is VM0003 v1.2 - Methodology for Improved Forest Management\nThrough Extension of Rotation Age (IFM ERA).\n4\n\nProject Description: VCS Version 4.1\n\u2022 The Project is a Grouped Project.\n1.3 Project Eligibility\nAs stated by the VCS Standard V4.2, eligible IFM activities are those that increase carbon\nsequestration and\/or reduce GHG emissions on forest lands managed for wood products\nsuch as sawtimber, pulpwood and fuelwood by increasing biomass carbon stocks through\nimproving forest management practices. The baseline and project scenarios for the project\narea shall qualify as forests remaining as forests, such as set out in the IPCC 2006\nGuidelines on National GHG Inventories, and the project area shall be designated,\nsanctioned, or approved for wood product management by a national or local regulatory\nbody (e.g., as logging concessions or plantations).\nThe project XiCO2e: Mexican Peninsula Forest Project is eligible for Improved Forest\nManagement as it will increase carbon removals by extending the rotation period and overall\nforest age with respect to the baseline scenario. Additionally, by the time of project validation,\nall Project Areas will hold FSC certification, therefore the project will comply all applicability\nconditions of methodology VM0003 and be is eligible under the scope of the VCS Program\nprior project validation.\n1.4 Project Design\n\u2612 The project is a grouped project\nThe project is a grouped project that the first instance consists of the commercial harvesting\nareas of 15 different ejidos.\nEligibility Criteria\nBy the time this document was submitted, it is not expected to include further project activity\ninstances.\nThis is a grouped project and therefore eligible ejidos and comunidades1 can join the project\nin the future should they meet the following criteria:\n\u2022 Ejidos and comunidades must be located within the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, which\nincludes the states Campeche, Quintana Roo and Yucat\u00e1n in Mexico.\n\u2022 Ejidos and comunidades must be managed by Ala Bool in concordance with\nForliance GmbH.\n1 Comunidades are communal properties similar to ejidos.\n5","output":"{'project_sector': 'Forestry and Land Use'}"}

The energy that will be\ndelivered to the grid is generated by renewable power generation as reflected in the combined\nmargin emissions factor (as per the tool applied). Since the project consists of a wind farm plant\nthat does not generate GHG emissions itself, but reduces emissions of other power plants, it is\nclear that it has not been implemented to generate GHG emissions for the purpose of their\nsubsequent reduction, removal or destruction. For more information please go to Section 2.4\n(Baseline Scenario).\n1.11 Compliance with Laws, Statutes and Other Regulatory Frameworks\nThere are two main laws which define the regulatory framework of the electricity generation\nsector in Dominican Republic in general, and to promote renewable energy in particular. These\nare briefly described below. The General Electricity Act (created by the law 125-01 of 2001) and\nits modification with the law 186-07 of August 2007. The main issues defined by the law are the\nfollowing:\n- Assurance that at least 20 % of all electricity trading is done on the spot market.\n- Limiting distribution company ownership of generating plants to not more than 15% of peak\nload in the interconnected system (renewable energy sources are exempt from this rule).\n- Regulation of electricity tariffs for public-grid customers with maximum connected loads of 2\nMW as long as the customers do not enter into direct contracts with the suppliers.\n- Electricity companies which intend to operate an electricity generation business above 2 MW\nmust request a concession for the operation of electricity works14.\n- Regulation of transit tariffs for the use of transmission and distribution of facilities.\n14 Source: Reglamento para la Aplicaci\u00f3n de la Ley General de Electricidad (No. 125-01).
