The amounts of emissions assigned for each selected carbon\npool depicted in the table in Section 2.3 are determined at the verification stage. It should be\nnoted that it is not mandatory to measure ex-ante carbon stocks in the project area according to\nthe applied methodology. The ex-ante estimates of the net carbon benefits of the project are only\nrequired to determine whether decreases in carbon pools or increases in GHG emissions are\ninsignificant and need not be measured and monitored.\nTable 16: Estimated baseline emissions for selected carbon pools over total project crediting period.\nA spreadsheet with the complete GHG emission analysis for the entire project crediting period is\nprovided separately to the auditor68.\nThe sum of estimated emissions over selected carbon pools is calculated according to eq. 20 of\nthe methodology.\nThe following equations from the methodology will be used at the monitoring and verification\nstage to calculate the baseline emissions:\n\u2022 Baseline emissions in above ground large trees is calculated using eq. 21.\n\u2022 Baseline emissions for above ground small trees is calculated using eq. 22.\n\u2022 Baseline emissions in above ground non tree biomass is calculated using eq. 23.\n\u2022 Baseline emissions in below ground large trees is calculated using eq. 24.\n\u2022 Baseline emissions for below ground small trees is calculated using eq. 25.\n\u2022 Baseline emissions in below ground non tree biomass is calculated using eq. 26.\n68 \u201c130813_KARIBA ER Calc_Ex-ante_V5.xlsx\u201d\nv3.1 66\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n\u2022 Baseline emissions in standing dead wood is calculated using eq. 27.\n\u2022 Eq. 62 of the methodology is applied to calculate the total carbon stock in all selected carbon\npools.\nv3.1 67\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n3.2 Project Emissions\nProject emissions for any monitoring period are estimated by the events of woody biomass\nconsumption.\nForest fires: The Project proponent understands that should significant forest fires occur during\nthe project crediting period, a map of the boundaries of the fire during the monitoring period will\nbe elaborated. The project area may need to be re-stratified based on the significance of fire\nevents.\nEmissions from burning: No emissions from the burning of woody biomass as a result of project\nactivities in the project area occur.\nThe project emissions are calculated according to equation 31 of the methodology.\nv3.1 68\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n3.3 Leakage"}]}
