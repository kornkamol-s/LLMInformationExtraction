In Mexico, the mangrove areas in the state of\nCampeche are significantly impacted by deforestation and anthropogenic fires. The Project\nactivity is a REDD+ grouped project that will generate GHG emissions reductions by avoiding the\nunplanned deforestation of wetlands in the state of Campeche, while collaborating in partnership\nwith local communities to preserve the forest and secure biodiversity and social benefits.\nThe grouped project area currently encompasses 87,751 ha within Petenes and Laguna de\nT\u00e9rminos regions in Campeche. There are 32 (thirty-two) initial project activity instances (iPAIs)\ncomprising 32,599 ha eligible for blue carbon conservation, estimated to reduce approximately\n316,924 tCO e average per year. The grouped project will include more landowners as partners 2\nand areas for conservation as the project advances. The grouped project area is not covered by\nany jurisdictional REDD+ program.\nThe major deforestation drivers identified in the region are agriculture (i.a., oil palm, maize, and\nrice plantations), cattle ranching, and other unsustainable practices in e.g., tourism and fisheries;\ninfrastructure development; canal silting; storm damage; firewood harvesting; and anthropogenic\nfires, among others. The strategic blue carbon conservation activities, include i.a.:\n\u2022 Tidal canal rehabilitation and maintenance.\n\u2022 Soil rehabilitation and promotion of natural mangrove forest regeneration.\n\u2022 Mangrove deforestation and biophysical monitoring.\n\u2022 Community training and development of workshops including experiences exchange.\n\u2022 Institutional coordination for enhancing mangrove conservation activities.\nThe project proponent has been engaging with communities in ejidos (communal lands), state\nand private lands under a participatory, inclusive, and collaborative approach. The project began\non January 17, 2019, hosting communities\u2019 experiences exchange, capacity building,\nhydrological rehabilitation, environmental and biodiversity monitoring activities.\nBlueMX is advancing the design of the project complying with the Climate, Community and\nBiodiversity (CCB) Standards criteria and requirements.

Thus, the'], ['project activity achieves considerable amount of the GHG emission reduction into the atmosphere due to'], ['electricity generation using wind as a renewable energy source.']]\nA.1. Purpose and general description of project activity\nPurpose of the project activity\nThe project activity under consideration involves renewable energy generation from thirteen numbers of\nWind Turbine Generators (WTGs) with total installed capacity of 13.65 Mega-Watt (MW) (1.5 MW X\n4+ 0.85 MW X 9) promoted by Khatau Narbheram & Co. The net electricity generated by the WTGs is\nsupplied to the Southern Regional Electricity Grid of India through the nearest grid sub-station. There is\nno wheeling arrangement of the electricity generated by the project promoter.\nPre-Project Scenario:\nThe project is a Greenfield power generation project where no renewable power had been generated prior\nto the project activity. Also there was no other kind of occupancy in terms of any other industrial project,\ndwelling of local people at the project site etc. The project activity has been commissioned on unused\nland where there was no need to demolish any existing structure. Hence, in the pre-project scenario there\nwas barren unoccupied land where the WTGs stand now.\nBaseline Scenario:\nconnected\nproject\nelectricity\nThe estimated annual average GHG emission reductions because of project activity are estimated to\nabout 26,813 tCO per year. The fixed crediting period of 10 years has been chosen for the project 2\nactivity. The total number of GHG emission reductions over the crediting period is estimated to be about\n268,130 tCO . 2\nContribution to GHG emissions reduction\nThe project activity harnesses wind energy to generate and supply electricity to the southern regional\nelectricity grid of India. The Project displaces fossil fuel based electricity generation that would have\notherwise been provided by the operation and expansion of the fossil fuel based power plants in southern\nregion electricity grid, thereby leading to reduction in emission of greenhouse gases associated with\nfossil fuel based electricity generation.\nContribution to sustainable development\nThe project activity contributes towards sustainable development of the host country and the state of\nTamil Nadu by reducing the dependency on fossil fuel dominated based electricity generation, which\nultimately leads to reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The project also fulfils several other\nsustainable development objectives as illustrated below:\n\nUNFCCC\/CCNUCC\nCDM \u2013 Executive Board Page 3\nSocial well-being:\n\uf0b7 The social well-being is assessed by the contribution of the project activity towards improvement\nin the living standards of the local community. Project activities like wind power generation\nprovides job opportunities to the local population thus contributing towards social upliftment of\nthe local community.\n\uf0b7 This project activity has also led to the development of basic amenities leading to improvement\nin living standards of the local population. Thus the project activity has contributed to social\nwell-being.\nEconomic well-being:\n\uf0b7 Wind farms need large area. Thus, the procurement of land by the various project promoters, has\nled to the appreciation of land value benefiting the landowners and local community directly.\nThese lands were generally unproductive. Most of the wind energy potential areas are remotely\nlocated areas and are largely unfertile. These lands generally command low prices. But due to the\nland demand for wind farms, the land prices have increased leading to economic well-being of\nthe local community.\n\uf0b7 The project activity has created direct and indirect job opportunities to the local community\nduring installation and operation of the WEGs. The investment for the project activity has\nincreased the economic activity of the local area. The above have contributed to the economic\nwell-being and social well-being of the local community.\nEnvironmental well-being:\n\uf0b7 The project activity produces electricity without any greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\nAdditionally, the project activity generates electricity from a \u2018renewable energy source\u2019. The\nrenewable energy source is generally defined as a source of energy that gets replenished naturally\nand does not suffer permanent depletion due to use.\nTechnological well-being:\n\uf0b7 Advent of wind power projects in India will further enhance research and development (R&D)\nefforts by technology providers to develop more efficient and better machinery in future.\n\uf0b7 Overall technological well-being and development of the emission-free energy sector"}]}

In\naddition to the climate benefits, the Project also intends to generate social benefits based on sustainable\neconomic development practices and improved well-being of the surrounding communities, as well as\nenvironmental benefits through actions aimed at the conservation of local flora and fauna.\nThe Project area covers 50,519 hectares of Amazon forest and is located almost entirely in the northeastern\nmesoregion of Par\u00e1 State, including the municipalities of Tail\u00e2ndia, Moju, Tom\u00e9 A\u00e7u and Acar\u00e1. It is located\nnear the PA-150, an important highway for the distribution of the state's agricultural production, and on the\nbanks of the Acar\u00e1 River. We identified communities that are directly or indirectly influenced by the Project,\neither because they supply labor to Fazenda Agropalma or because they are geographically close to the\nProject Area and depend on its ecosystem services.\nThe region has great relevance in relation to its biodiversity, since it is located in the Bel\u00e9m Center of\nEndemism (CEB), a place with a large concentration of rare and endemic species. The predominant\nvegetation is Dense Ombrophylous Forest with a high density of medium and large trees, besides woody\nlianas and epiphytes. It is home to at least 28 species of fauna and flora with some degree of threat\naccording to the IUCN Red List, some of which are endemic to the region.\nIt was identified that the main agents of deforestation and forest degradation in the region are small,\nmedium-sized family farmers or even large landowners. They are mostly rural producers who own areas in\nagrarian reform settlements, squatters, and land grabbers who are in areas not yet recognized by the\nagrarian reform or officially registered in the responsible public agencies and practice deforestation to\nexpand areas of agricultural and livestock production with low productivity or to search for raw material to\nsustain the illegal trade in wood.\nBased on this context, the Project's activities were designed to guarantee the conservation and protection\nof biodiversity and natural resources, through mitigating and preventive measures such as the\nstrengthening of patrimonial vigilance, social inclusion and regional socioeconomic development through\nalternative practices to deforestation, and the development and strengthening of value chains, the\nestablishment of a biodiversity conservation program, promoting in situ monitoring of the fauna and flora in\nthe Project Area, in addition to environmental education as a strategy to discourage predatory hunting and\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3\n10\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\nfishing, and the strengthening of local governance, mainly through the engagement and involvement of\nstakeholders.\nThus, the Agropalma REDD+ Project expects to improve the welfare of communities and generate\nexceptional benefits for local biodiversity, in addition to the climate impact by reducing 6,717,438 tCO2 of\nGHG emissions in 10 years, equivalent to an average annual reduction of 671,743.8 tCO2."}]}
