The Beampingaratsy NPA is currently under creation in\npartnership with the DSAP (Direction for Protected Area dependent of the Ministry of environment and\nForest). The project proponent of the Beampingaratsy REDD Project is the BNC REDD, the\nadministration in charge of the development of REDD mechanism in Madagascar and dependent of the\nMinistry of environment and Forest. The Project is built on the experience of the HCPF Project, which has\nimplemented on the South part of the Project Area since 2008 with similar activities and objectives as\nthose of the Beampingaratsy REDD Project. HCPF Project has been financed by AFD (French Agency for\nDevelopment) since its beginning with a complement of AirFrance between 2008 and 2012. The\ngeographical scope evolved all along the different phases of the HCPF project until the focus on the\nBeampingaratsy site for the next phase that will start in 2018 (same boundaries as the REDD Project).\nThe Beampingaratsy NPA and the climate and biodiversity components of the Project are led by Etc\nTerra – Rongead, a French NGO also based in Madagascar. The agricultural activities will be led by\nAgrisud International, also a French NGO with offices in Madagascar. The Project has the full support of\nnational government and of the Anosy Region and the management of the NPA will be supported by the\nregional offices of the Ministry of Environment, the DREF Anosy.\nThe beginning or the official process to create the Beampingaratsy NPA marks the beginning of the\nBeampingaratsy REDD Project as a main initiative to manage land in this area and a first activity to\nenable a REDD Project elaboration. The forests inside the boundaries of the NPA (see Figure 12) are\nconsidered to form the Project Area where the Project aims to decrease deforestation thanks to\nagricultural support and land management. It was composed of 79,101 ha of humid forest in 2015\n(which is therefore the size of the Project Area), before project start date (05-10-2017).\nAbout 25,491 inhabitants live around the PA (see Table 1). Subsistence agriculture is their main\neconomic activity, with 98% of the population practicing it (see section 4.1.1). They cultivate cassava,\nmaize and rice either on rainfed or irrigated fields (located in valleys for the last). Main cause of\ndeforestation is the common practice of slash and burn agriculture (Figure 30). Agricultural activities are\nleading to a mean historical deforestation level of 1,612 ha/yr in the reference region (RRD - Figure 24) of\nthe project, between 2005 and 2015. This rate is equivalent to a level of 515 ha/yr in the project area.\nIn order to reduce deforestation, the Beampingaratsy REDD project is developing several activities (see\nsection 2.1.11):\n\uf0b7 Classify the Beampingaratsy forest under the status of New Protected Area to ensure the official\nprotection of massif;\n\uf0b7 Support of the existing COBA in the management of the CBNRM transfer and on the provision of\nservices to communities;\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 17\n\nCCB + VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\n\uf0b7 Provide alternatives to deforestation to local communities through a better management of the\nterritory with participative land use planning, construction of rural infrastructure such as irrigated\nschemes, restoration of degraded lands, reforestation and to individual households through\necological intensification and new income generating activities.;\n\uf0b7 Support the emergence of services for farmers with the creation/strengthening of farmers\norganizations, local private small enterprises or COBA and the structuration of suitable value\nchain for the commercialization of cash crops;\n\uf0b7 Contribution to decentralization process and to capacity building for Commune concerned by the\nproject through the development of forest services, Land Use plans and land tenure clarification\noffices.\nThe objective is to reduce deforestation by 35% in average against the reference level during the first 5\nyears of project implementation and by 80% after 10 years. Until now, activities were funded by the AFD.\nOnce the REDD project is validated, the sale of carbon credits is expected to help financing part of the\nactivities implemented with the communities but other funds will be necessary.\nThe reference emissions level was calculated for the 2005-2010-2015 period (Reference Period) with\nmultiplication of activity data and emissions factors. Deforestation and biomass burning are considered as\nsources of GHG emissions and only carbon stocks changes in Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and Below\nGround Biomass (BGB) tree pools are considered. The baseline of the project was established using the\nVM0007 methodology. Areas of deforestation for the reference period (2005-2015) were assessed with\na multi-dates analysis of Landsat images that allows classification of land cover and land cover changes\n(LCLCC) with a satisfactory accuracy (section 3.2.1.1).\nFor pre- (3 humid forest strata) and post-deforestation class, emissions factors were established using the\nresults of a carbon stocks map realized with a LiDAR flyover on a part of PA (Asner et al., 2012 – see\nsection 3.2.1.2). Average pre-deforestation carbon stocks used are 22 tC/ha for low forest, 111 tC/ha for\nmedium forest and 75 tC/ha for high forest (the 3 forest strata) and post-deforestation stocks are\n10 tC/ha. According to the methodology used, after deforestation event, all aboveground tree biomass is\nconsidered as emissions while belowground tree biomass is emitted with a default rate of 10% per year.\nExpected emissions reduction were calculated as the difference between estimated baseline emissions\nand emissions calculated in the project case (monitoring of deforestation areas), both for the Project Area\n(PA) and the Leakage Belt (LB). Additional emissions (against LB baseline) in LB will be deduced from\nthe emissions reductions. Results for the first 10 years are expected emissions reduction of\n145,901 tCO eq (section 3.2.4). Non-permanence risk of emissions reduction was evaluated following the 2\nmethodology requirements. It was used to estimate the size of the buffer to set-aside credits in order to\ncompensate this risk and it results to 11%.\nThe targeted general benefits for the communities are the following:\n\uf0b7 Food security will be ensured thanks to better management of soil fertility with agroecology\ntechniques, which will enable to increase and diversify the food production and favor a wider\nchoice of diet.\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 18\n\nCCB + VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\n\uf0b7 Technical support (agro-ecology) and advices on cash crops (cultivation, value chain\nstructuration, organization of agricultural service providers) will increase and diversify households’\nincomes. This will contribute to local capacity building.\n\uf0b7 Climate vulnerability of community will also be reduced with sustainable agricultural techniques\n(agroforestry and reduction of deforestation) such as the presence of tree which positively impact\nwater availability.\n\uf0b7 The availability of essential forest resources will be maintained or improved, through more\nsustainable agricultural practices (conservation of forest cover), the protection of Beampingaratsy\nforest (NPA) with a sustainable management plan for the use of NTFP (developed together with\ncommunities) and work around long term land use planning;\n\uf0b7 The support to existing COBA for the proposition of basic services and to communes for the\nelaboration of land use management plan and development of forest services will contribute to\nimprove human and social capitals by capacity building of local communities and representatives,\nthe provision of basic services (education, health, services). The same will be achieve with the\nparticipatory development of land use management plans.\n\uf0b7 Finally the creation of land tenure offices and the participatory development of land use\nmanagement plans will contribute to securing land tenure, especially for those groups that have a\ndifficult access to lands outside forest which increases their dependency to slash and burn\nagriculture.\nNet project benefits for communities are summarized in Table 33.\nIn the without-project scenario, biodiversity is affected by progressive decrease of forest cover due to\nslash and burn agriculture, non-controlled logging and the maintenance or increase of animal poaching (3\nflora species and 14 fauna species were identified as threatened or endangered). On the contrary project\nactivities are expected to generate biodiversity benefits by the long-term protection of forest landscape,\nwhich contributes to the preservation and enhancement of the faunal and floristic populations. Through\nthe long-term preservation of the Beampingaratsy forest cover thanks to the creation of the NPA, the\nProject is expected to generate positive impacts on biodiversity by preserving habitats and floristic and\nfauna species in the endangered landscape of humid forest of Madagascar. Moreover, the protection of\nthe forest corridor between the two National Parks of Andohahela and Midongy du Sud will guarantee the\nmaintenance of a large suitable habitat and the genes flow between wildlife populations. The elaboration\nof a management plan which will guarantee the sustainability of local uses of forest: collection of NTFP,\nforest exploitation for local construction and hunting. Reduce human activities that do not comply with the\nconservation of biodiversity. Finally the monitoring system of the Project and the NPA will furnish valuable\ndata on local biodiversity that will contribute to improve the knowledge of this poorly studied region.'}]",{'project_country': 'Madagascar'},{'project_country': 'Madagascar'},1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

This\ncan be refer from the page 19 of the PoA-DD of this PoA (version 17 dated 05/09/2019.\nAs the value obtained from the survey conducted by Nepal Environmental and Scientific Services\n(NESS) in 2010 is conservative than the recent values identified in 2018, the conservative value\nof 4.23 ton/year/households is taken for this project.\n3 https://cdm.unfccc.int/filestorage/F/U/4/FU4LR8H6NWKXVTBJO3MDYP9I75GSQ1/PoA-\nDD_9572_V17.pdf?t=NUl8cWxveXRkfDDbFQVznwNJFsrITtWy5y5E\n\nAdditionality\nAccording to the applied methodology AMS.II.G version 11.1, additionality may be demonstrated\nusing one of the following options specified by the methodology. Option 1 (positive list) was ruled\nout as the penetration of ICS (in-situ and factory based model combined) was around 7.4% in the\nyear 2015.4 Similarly, since the project is prepared under the small scale threshold, the\napplication of Tool 19 as specified in option 3 was also ruled out. Hence, the additionality\nassessment is conducted based on option 2 using Tool 21 “Demonstration of additionality of SSC\nproject activities”.\nThis project is voluntarily implemented by the developer as there is no mandatory legal provision\nto be complied with in relation to the installation and use of ICS. Though proposed project has\ndisseminated 16,810 stoves which is within the small-scale threshold limit. All the stoves\ndistributed in the project has been implemented in the households using traditional cooking\nstoves as the baseline cooking device operating at low efficiency thereby contributing to higher\nconsumption of the solid biomass and therefore the higher baseline GHG emissions attributable\nto the non-renewable biomass.\nTool 21 version 13.1 specifies that the project additionality may be assessed with regards to one\nof the four barriers; investment barrier, technological barrier, barrier due to prevailing practice\nand other barriers outlined in para 10 of the tool. For the demonstration of additionality of the\nproposed project the project participant has opted for investment barrier that prevents the project\nto have been implemented without carbon revenue.\nThe proposed project has disseminated the cookstove units to the households free of cost and\nthere is no any other financial incentive for the implementation and use of such ICS. All the costs\nrelated to stove construction, distribution, monitoring, project management, implementation\narrangement and carbon related costs will be covered from the carbon revenue that will be\ngenerated as part of this project. The energy efficient cookstoves operate at efficiency greater\nthan 20% and hence is impactful when it comes to the reduction in firewood consumption and\ntherefore the mitigation of GHG. As the project implementation doesn’t result in any other form\nof financial return, in absence of the project being developed as carbon project, the project would\nnot occur. Further, although the statistics suggest that the penetration of ICS is 7.4%, any\nadditional revenue that the project will be able to generate will be used to enhance access to\nother users that are still relying on traditional cookstoves to meet their cooking energy\nrequirement. The likelihood of the existence of improve cooking stoves project in absence of the\ncarbon revenue is unlikely; hence, the investment barrier for the implementation of the project is\njustified.\n4http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/916571494854063344/pdf/Investment-prospectus-for-clean-cooking-\nsolutions-in-Nepal-a-roadmap-to-national-goal-of-providing-clean-cooking-solutions-for-all.pdf (table 9 page 33)\n\nMethodology Deviations\nN/A.\nESTIMATED GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS\nAND REMOVALS\nBaselineEmissions\nAMS II.G/v11.1 requires that the project participants assume that in the absence of the project\nactivity, the baseline scenario would be the projected use of fossil fuels for meeting similar\nthermal energy needs. The actual baseline scenario is the use of NRB. Since NRB has higher\ncarbon intensity than the fossil fuels proposed in AMS II.G, this assumption reduces the emission\nreductions significantly, making the outcome more conservative. According to paragraph 24 of\nmethodology AMS II.G, emission reductions would be calculated as:\n𝐸𝑅 =∑∑𝐸𝑅 𝑦 𝑦,𝑖\n𝑖 𝑗\nWhere:\ni = Indices for the situation where more than one type of project device\nisintroduced to replace the pre-project devices\nERy = Emission reductions during year y in tCO2e\nERy,i = Emission reductions by project device of type i during year y in tCO2e\nFor household cook stoves (as guided by the methodology):\n𝐸𝑅 =𝐵 ×𝑁 ×𝜇 ×𝑓 ×𝑁𝐶𝑉 ×𝐸𝐹 𝑦,𝑖,𝑗 𝑦,𝑠𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠,𝑖,𝑗 𝑦,𝑖,𝑗 𝑦 𝑁𝑅𝐵,𝑦 𝑏𝑖𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑_𝑓𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑙𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙\nWhere:\n𝑩 = Quantity of woody biomass that is saved in tonnes per cookstove device of type i 𝒚,𝒔𝒂𝒗𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒔,𝒊,𝒋\nand batch j during year y\n𝒇 = Fraction of woody biomass that can be established as non-renewable biomass (fNRB) 𝑵𝑹𝑩,𝒚\n𝑵𝑪𝑽 = Net calorific value of the non-renewable woody biomass that is substituted (IPCC 𝒃𝒊𝒐𝒎𝒂𝒔𝒔\ndefault for wood fuel, 0.0156 TJ/tonne, based on the gross weight of the wood that is ‘air-dried’)\n\n𝑬𝑭 = Emission factor for the fossil fuels projected to be used for substitution of non- 𝒑𝒓𝒐𝒋𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒆𝒅\n_𝒇𝒐𝒔𝒔𝒊𝒍𝒇𝒖𝒆𝒍\nrenewable woody biomass by similar consumers.

The population of the province is 34 million.\nThe Puzhen Afforestation Project (hereafter referred as “the Project”) is located within 2 counties;\nPuding County and Zhenning County, The project is to plant native species on barren land for purposes\nof GHG removal whilst contributing to local sustainable development goals. The project is implemented\njointly by Forestry Bureau of Puding County and Forestry Bureau of Zhenning County.26,551ha of\nforest was planted on degraded lands in these two counties.\nThe Project involves a total of 227 villages in 2 counties, with a total population of nearly 88,202 people.\nAll the barren lands for afforestation activities belong to the villagers and the village committees manage\nthe lands on behalf of the villagers. Guizhou Baiheng Fertilizer Co., Ltd (hereinafter referred to as\nGuizhou Baiheng or Baiheng) has been fully authorized by all the village committees through a signed\ncontract to act as the project proponent to implement project implementation, management, monitoring\nand to sell VCUs generated from the project. This enables Baiheng to consolidate the offset resources\ninto sizeable forestry offset projects. Baiheng will profit-share with the villagers from the sale of VCUs.\nThe implementation of the project activity has provided 19,900 jobs for local villagers, among which 70%\nare women.\nThe project activity aims to:\n- Sequester greenhouse gas and mitigate climate change;\n- Enhance biodiversity conservation by increasing the connectivity of forests;\n- Improve soil and water conservation in the Karst region and increase the forest cover;\n- Generate income and job opportunities for local village communities.\nThere is no natural renewal and afforestation before the project, and all sites were covered by barren\nland. The main species planted is Cypress which is the native species according to the baseline survey.\nThe implementation of the project would reduce GHG emissions amounting to 9,390,696 tCO e over the 2\nnext 30 years, with an average annual GHG emission of 313,023 tCO e. 2\nCCB v3.0, VCS 8\n\nCCB + VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3'}]",{'project_state_province': 'Guizhou Province'},{'project_state_province': 'Guizhou Province'},1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

As the\nproposed project activity is the implementation of a solar photovoltaic project that supplies electricity to\ngrid, hence it falls under this category.\nTechnical description\nThe project activity is solar photovoltaic based power generation project. The total installed capacity of\nthe Solar PV power project is 10 MWp. 20 numbers of “500KWp” inverters are installed at the plant site\nto convert the DC (Direct Current) power to AC (Alternate Current) Power.\nThe proposed plant will be predominantly south oriented and layout with PV panel of Multicrystalline\ntechnology.\nPhotovoltaic module consists of several photovoltaic cells connected by circuits and sealed in and\nenvironmentally protective laminate, which forms the fundamental building blocks of the complete PV\ngenerating unit. Several PV panels mounted on a frame and grouped are termed as PV Array.\nThe DC electric power generated by the photo voltaic modules will be converted into 0.3 kV, 50Hz, AC\npower by inverters, which will be stepped up to 11 kV through a set of transformers located in a\ndistributed manner all over the plant. From the outgoing side of the transformers, power will be\ntransmitted through a set of cable feeders to 11 kV indoor switchboard panel in a centrally located grid\ninterface substation. In the substation, the total power generated will be stepped up to 66 kV by 12500\nkVA capacity power transformer with its associated 66 kV outdoor switch gear for interconnection to\nthe 66 kV transmission line of GETCO.\nThe project is a Renewable Energy project which displaces the electricity from the Grid that is\ndominated by carbon intensive fossil fuel. The electricity generation from the project activity is an\nenvironmentally safe and sound power generation technology.\nThe project activity used the reliable and proven technology available locally to ensure that an\nenvironmentally safe technology is only being implemented in the proposed project activity.\nThe modules that installed in the project activity are Poly crystalline (230 Wp) modules.

(Version 02.2.1)\n""Tool to calculate project or leakage CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion"" (Version 02).\n2.2 Applicability of Methodology\nThe methodology ACM0002 (Version 13.0.0) is applicable to the proposed project activity\nbecause the proposed project meets all the applicability criteria stated in the methodology:\nThe methodology is applicable under the following conditions:\n• “The project activity is the installation, capacity addition, retrofit or replacement of a\npower plant/unit of one of the following types: hydro power plant/unit (either with a run-\nof-river reservoir or an accumulation reservoir), wind power plant/unit, geothermal power\nplant/unit, solar power plant/unit, wave power plant/unit or tidal power plant/unit;\n• In the case of capacity additions, retrofits or replacements (except for wind, solar, wave\nor tidal power capacity addition projects which use Option 2 on page 10 (of the ACM0002\n(version 13.0.0)). to calculate the parameter EG ): the existing plant started PJ,y\ncommercial operation prior to the start of a minimum historical reference period of five\nyears, used for the calculation of baseline emissions and defined in the baseline emission\nsection, and no capacity expansion or retrofit of the plant has been undertaken between\nthe start of this minimum historical reference period and the implementation of the project\nactivity;”\nThe proposed project activity fits to first condition stated above as it is the installation of a new\npower plant at a site where no renewable power plant was operated prior to the implementation of\nthe project activity (greenfield plant).\n“In case of hydro power plants:\n• One of the following conditions must apply:\nv3.0 14\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\no The project activity is implemented in an existing single or multiple reservoirs, with no\nchange in the volume of any of reservoirs; or\no The project activity is implemented in an existing single or multiple reservoirs, where\nthe volume of any of reservoirs is increased and the power density of each reservoir,\nas per the definitions given in the Project Emissions section, is greater than 4 W/m2;\nor\no The project activity results in new single or multiple reservoirs and the power density\nof each reservoir, as per the definitions given in the Project Emissions section, is\ngreater than 4 W/m2.”\nIn case of Damlapınar HPP, there is only a regulator that rises the water level to transfer the\nwater to the water conveying system. At the maximum operation level of 689.30 m water level the\ntotal extend of the area that is flooded by river is 467,465.40 m2 therefore the power density is\ncalculated to be 35 W/m2, which is much greater than 4W/ m2.\n“In case of hydro power plants using multiple reservoirs where the power density of any of the\nreservoirs is lower than 4 W/m2 all the following conditions must apply:\n• The power density calculated for the entire project activity using equation 5 (provided in\nthe methodology) is greater than 4 W/m2;\n• Multiple reservoirs and hydro power plants located at the same river and where are\ndesigned together to function as an integrated project that collectively constitute the\ngeneration capacity of the combined power plant;\n• Water flow between multiple reservoirs is not used by any other hydropower unit which is\nnot a part of the project activity;\n• Total installed capacity of the power units, which are driven using water from the\nreservoirs with power density lower than 4 W/m2, is lower than 15MW;\n• Total installed capacity of the power units, which are driven using water from reservoirs\nwith power density lower than 4 W/m2, is less than 10% of the total installed capacity of\nthe project activity from multiple reservoirs.”\nThe proposed project activity does not have multiple reservoirs so the above conditions are not\napplicable and the project activity is eligible.\n“The methodology is not applicable to the following:\n• Project activities that involve switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources at\nthe site of the project activity, since in this case the baseline may be the continued use of\nfossil fuels at the site;\n• Biomass fired power plants;\nv3.0 15\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION : VCS Version 3\n• A hydro power plant that results in the creation of a new single reservoir or in the\nincrease in an existing single reservoir where the power density of the power plant is less\nthan 4 W/m2. “\nThe proposed project activity does not involve switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy\nsources at the site of the project activity, is not a biomass fired plant, is not a hydro power plant\nthat results in the creation of a new single reservoir or in the increase in an existing single\nreservoir where the power density of the power plant is less than 4 W/m2, there fore the project\nactivity is eligible to implement the ACM0002 version 13.0.0\n“In the case of retrofits, replacements, or capacity additions, this methodology is only applicable if\nthe most plausible baseline scenario, as a result of the identification of baseline scenario, is “the\ncontinuation of the current situation, i.e. to use the power generation equipment that was already\nin use prior to the implementation of the project activity and undertaking business as usual\nmaintenance”.\nThe project is not a retrofit, replacement or capacity addition so the above condition is not\napplicable,\nIn addition, Damlapınar HPP meets the applicability conditions included in “Tool for the\ndemonstration and assessment of additionality” (Version 6.0.0) and “Tool to calculate the\nemission factor for an electricity system” (Version 2.2.0) referred below, the following reasons\njustify the applicability of the methodological tools:\n• “Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality” (Version 6.0.0) is required to\napply for demonstrating and assessing the additionality of a project activity in ACM0002\n(Version 13.0.0).\nAccording to the “Tool to calculate the emission factor for an electricity system” (Version 2.2.0),\n“This tool may be applied to estimate the OM, BM and/or CM when calculating baseline\nemissions for a project activity that substitutes grid electricity, i.e. where a project activity supplies\nelectricity to a grid.” Accordingly, Damlapınar HPP will supply electricity to the Turkish National\nGrid, and therefore this tool can be used to estimate the OM, BM and CM of calculating baseline\nemissions.\n2.3 Project Boundary\nTable 5 exhibits the gases included in the project boundary. CO2 emission is included in the\nbaseline but the project activity does not emit any of the gases listed, in Table 5.\nThe project boundary includes net electricity generated and supplied to the Turkish national grid.\nThe internal consumption and the GHG due to the temporary use and burning of the diesel fuel\nby the auxiliary power generators.\nv3.0 16'}]","[{'organization_name': 'Cenay Elektrik Uretim Ins.San. ve Tic.

The\nproject is aimed to restore the local degraded grassland ecosystem from adoption of sustainable\ngrassland management practices, such as improving the rotation of grazing animals, limiting the\ntiming and number of grazing animals on degraded pastures, and ensuring appropriate\nmanagement over the long-term. The project proponent is Yining County State-owned Investment\nCapital Management limited liability Company.\nThe main restoration measure rest and rotational grazing were implemented in 266,666.78 ha of\ndegraded grassland where the theoretical animal capacity is about 521.3 thousand sheep which\nwas decreased by 51.15% compared with the non-degraded grassland data in 200313. The project\narea is categorized into two groups. The first group of grassland will undergo sustainable grassland\nmanagement practices, which include implementing rotational grazing in different pastoral areas.\nThis approach involves limiting the duration and number of grazing activities in the project area to\nprotect the natural resources of the grassland and prevent further deterioration of the ecological\nenvironment. In contrast, the second group of grassland will experience a prohibition on grazing\nduring the first five years of the project. After this initial period, sustainable grassland management\nmethods will be applied. These methods involve reducing grazing time by dividing the grasslands\ninto seasonal grazing areas, determined by the carrying capacity of the grassland and the\nconstruction of fences. Specific guidelines, such as designated grazing orders, grazing cycles, and\nzoning for grazing time, will be followed to ensure that the grassland is grazed systematically, area\nby area, in a rotational manner.\nIn addition to the main restoration measures, the project incorporates various grassland\nmanagement measures aimed at mitigating soil desertification, restoring grassland vegetation,\nenhancing soil carbon storage, and promoting local biodiversity. These additional measures include\ninitiatives such as rodent and pest control, as well as grassland fire prevention. By implementing\nthese additional measures, the project aims to ensure the long-term sustainable management of\nthe project area, mitigate soil desertification, restore grassland vegetation, and ultimately contribute\nto the improvement of soil carbon storage and the preservation of local biodiversity.\nAccording to the baseline survey, before the implementation of the project, the grassland in the\nproject area was facing serious degradation and even desertification due to the impact of climate\nchange and human activities. The project is estimated to generate GHG emission removals of\n5,097,316 tCO e in 20 years, with an average annual GHG emission removal of 254,866 tCO e. 2 2\nThe objectives of the project including:\n⚫ Climate: Restore the degraded grassland ecosystem, increase grassland coverage, increase\ngrassland carbon sink function, and reduce GHG emissions.\n13 County annals\nCCB v3.0, VCS v3.3 8\n\nCCB & VCS PROJECT DESCRIPTION:\nCCB Version 3, VCS Version 3\n⚫ Community: Improve the livelihood of local herders, provide permanent and temporary job\nopportunities for them, increase their income.

Basin’s charter is to\nprovide low cost, reliable electric power to its owner/members. BEPC incorporated a wholly\nowned subsidiary PrairieWinds SD1 (PWSD1) to develop the Crow Lake Wind project which it\nsubsequently merged into BEPC. BEPC is also purchasing the power and the environmental\nbenefits generated by the MTI turbine.\nMTI opened in 1968 as part of a post-high school vocational technical education system in\nSouth Dakota that included four area institutes and the South Dakota Office of Adult,\nVocational and Technical Education. The central mission of the Institute is to provide job\npreparatory programs on a full- or part-time basis to all who can benefit.

Selection of the baseline scenario:\nSection 2.4 “Description of how the baseline scenario is identified and description of the identified\nbaseline scenario”of the VCS PD was used to identify the most likely baseline scenario. Using this\nstepwise approach the most plausible baseline scenario is the continuation of the existing land use:\nunproductive pastureland.\nStep 2. Investment analysis\nN/A. For the Campo Verde project, barrier analysis is performed as a stand-alone additionality\nanalysis.\nStep 3. Barrier analysis70\nThe proposed project activities face barriers that prevent the implementation of the proposed project\nactivity. The barriers for both project activities: A/R through direct planting and A/R through assisted\nnatural regeneration face the same barriers and therefore the analysis is presented together.\nHowever, the most likely baseline scenario, unproductive pastureland, does not face any barriers to\nimplementation.\nThe Campo Verde project had been looking for a financial partner for approximately 3 years before\nSFM became involved. As documented below, the project undertook several efforts to raise finance\nfrom a variety of sources, all of them unsuccessful until SFM agreed to finance the reforestation\nactivities. SFM’s financing has been provided on an all equity basis as conventional bank finance was\nnot available.\nSub-step 3a. Identify barriers that would prevent the implementation of type of the proposed project\nactivity:\nInvestment Barriers:\nDebt funding is not available for long-term reforestation projects in Peru. Reforestation through direct\nplanting or assisted natural regeneration requires considerable investment in the initial years to\nimplement the project; namely negotiations with stakeholders to expel grazing animals, the funding\nof nursery development, planting costs, maintenance, fire prevention and fire fighting. Returns are\ngenerated only in the long-term. Consequently reforestation projects require considerable up-front\nfinancing, with only long-term returns for investors. The project’s risk-adjusted return to investors is\nnot appealing to local or international investors. One of the main risks is that there is a lack of\ncommercial demonstration of the growth and yield of native species plantations or of assisted natural\nregeneration. Therefore, making the risk-adjusted return to investors unattractive.\n69 VCS Additionality Project Test: Step 2: Regulatory Surplus (Section 5.8 of VCS 2007.1)\n70 VCS Additionality – Project Test – Step 2 Implementation Barriers (Section 5.8 VCS 2007.1)\n49\n\nVCS Project Description – Campo Verde\nPublic funding for reforestation activities in the Ucayali region is almost nonexistent. In the 2008\nUcayali’s budget, funding for reforestation projects of native species was not considered while\nfunding for reforestation of fast-growth species and for the recovery of degraded areas sums S/.\n780,000 (seven hundred and eighty thousand Nuevos Soles) less than 1% of Ucayali’s budget.71\nFunding from commercial banks is very limited as well. According to the USAID report Rural and\nAgricultural Finance: Emerging Practices from Peruvian Financial Institutions, “the formal financial\nsystem in Peru, all entities regulated by the Superintendency of Banks and Insurance, provides very\nlimited rural and agricultural finance services and most financial institutions focus uniquely on serving\nurban clients”.72\nThe banks that do provide rural and agricultural finance require a repayment period not longer than 3\nyears73. Moreover, COFIDE, the government sponsored Peruvian development bank, offers funding\nfor projects for up to 10 years only74.\nAs an example, efforts were made by BAM to access debt funding for a period of three years\nunsuccessfully. Details of the efforts to secure funding by project proponents are provided in Step 5\nbelow.\nTechnological Barrier:\nSince afforestation is not a common practice, access to planting materials such as seedlings for\nprojects on a commercial scale is limited in the region. This substantially increases the costs required\nto produce seedlings. Although plantation development in Peru had been advocated by the\nReforestation Committee – INRENA, after the Committee was closed existing plantations were\nabandoned.\nPrevailing Practice Barrier\nReforestation through direct planting or assisted natural regeneration is not commonly practiced in\nthe Pucallpa region. According to INRENA,75 for the period 2001-2006, only 196 hectares have been\nreforested in Ucayali Region. In the 1980’s the Reforestation Committee of IRENA worked to promote\nplantations in local communities. However, the growth of the planted trees was not monitored and\nmost plantations were not successfully established.\nPlantation development has always been advocated by the Comite de Reforestation, a program under\nthe authority of INRENA. The Comite was concerned about the establishment of the plantations\nmainly, but not about the maintenance of them. After the program was closed, plantations were\nabandoned by almost all of the communities and farmers that were associated with the project. For\ninstance according to ITTO, in Peru “between 1997 and 2000 Prosopis was sown over more than\n400,000 hectares to thicken sparse woody formations and to establish new woody cover where there\nwas none before. However, it is estimated that only 10% survived.”76\nCurrently, a combination of fires, grazing, and an invasive grass species prevents reforestation\nthrough natural regeneration. The fires are anthropogenic and are initiated outside the proposed\n71 Congreso de la Republica de Peru, 2008.

Location and Quantification of Threat of Unplanned Deforestation\nSpatial analysis was conducted with the IDRISI SELVA software (Eastman 2011), and the Land Change\nModeler (LCM) which is an integrated software environment. LCM is a spatially-explicit modeling tool that\nwas used to model the location of deforestation projected in the baseline for both the project area and\nleakage belt. LCM was developed by Clark Labs in conjunction with the Andes Center of Biodiversity\nConservation of Conservation International, and has been tested extensively in the South America (Clark\nlabs 2007). LCM provides a wide range of tools organized in a series of steps for analyzing land cover\nchange; modeling potential for change; predicting change and validating results. For this analysis, LCM\nwas used to produce a vulnerability map of the project area and leakage belt. Translation of the\nvulnerability map into a scenario map of deforestation through the project term was conducted with a rank\nand assign operation. This model meets the criteria of (1) being peer-reviewed, (2) transparent, (3)\nincorporating spatial datasets used to explain patterns of deforestation, and (4) is capable of projecting\nthe location of future deforestation (Kim 2010, Sangermano et al., 2010, Eastman et al., 2005).46\nAll spatial modeling analysis is performed on the reference region for projecting location of deforestation\n(RRL). The RRL is defined in section 3.1.1 and encompasses the area surrounding the project area and\nleakage belt (see Figure 3.1). Information from the reference region is analyzed under a spatially explicit\nmodeling framework to construct future scenarios of how deforestation can be allocated in the reference\nregion. In conformance with the VCS modular REDD methodology VM0007, location analysis was\nconducted since the initial configuration of the RRL landscape was a frontier configuration.'}]",No relevant information found in context,{'project_country': 'United States'},0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
